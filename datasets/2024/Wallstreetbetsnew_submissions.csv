14,STAL Crazy play here *Must Read* DD,"STAL is very interesting one, the main 2 things to consider are:

•New eco friendly mining tech Genesis and Patented Barotex.

•STAL valuation compared to the estimated resource at their Troy Mining project, valued at $4B

Genesis Recovery System:

The Genesis Oxide System is a new approach to gold extraction by accelerating the dissolution rate of gold, reducing extraction time from 40-120 days to a mere 12-48 hours. This significant reduction in time translates into remarkable cost savings for production. The system’s scalability and modular design enable easy transportation between locations, offering versatility and practical solutions to challenges posed by fine materials, eliminating the need for agglomeration. At its core, the Genesis system comprises a reactor module, enhancing adaptability in installation, construction, and repositioning. This innovative system outperforms traditional extraction methods and meets the industry’s demands for effectiveness, feasibility, and reliability. Operating a complete module requires a compact area of only 2,500 square meters. This would significantly reduce the space required to run a recovery system when compared to other systems like heap leaching. Furthermore, the Genesis Refractory System handles complex ores, boasting an impressive 98% transformation rate from double refractory locked gold into free oxide gold. If you have no idea what double refractory locked gold means, here’s further explanation:

Gold ore containing two types of refractory minerals, commonly sulfides and carbonaceous material. “Locked” gold signifies that the gold is enclosed within these refractory minerals, making extraction challenging. Requires specialized methods: Extraction process demands specific techniques to separate gold from these minerals due to their interlocking nature. The Genesis Refractory System is environmentally safe, emission-free, and economically advantageous. Notably, these systems not only efficiently extract minerals from tailing piles, surpassing previous methods, but also contribute to environmental cleanup by leaving behind usable rock residue suitable for various applications like road construction. It’s even very effective on coal tailings. The system can unlock valuable rare earth elements and other noble metals, underscoring its importance in resource recovery across multiple verticals with environmental rehabilitation in mind. The Troy Mining asset anticipates leveraging this technology to enhance economic viability and extraction efficiency in low-grade areas. Furthermore, employing this technology as an asset to support other mines grappling with uneconomical low-grade ore holds substantial potential benefits. Genesis stands as a pivotal catalyst that could drive substantial growth for STAL if the implementation continues as envisioned.

Troy Mining Asset:

Star Alliance International Corp completed the acquisition of assets from Troy Mining Corp, a Nevada corporation. These assets encompass 78 gold mining claims situated in Mariposa County, California, east/southeast of El Portal. The acquisition was secured through a comprehensive agreement involving a combination of stock and cash, granting Star Alliance International Corp full ownership of the assets, including a production processing mill, associated structures, mining equipment, geological and assay reports, and core drilling samples. According to the company, a man by the name of Daniel Geiger purchased the project around 20 years ago and raised funds to further develop the asset but decided to secretly divert those funds into another project. Unfortunately for Mr. Geiger that meant Federal authorities filing charges and the result?… Prison. The federal government then decided to hire Mr. Robert B. Garcia to estimate the project’s value, an experienced figure in mining and precious metals with a chemistry degree from Arizona State University. Garcia previously worked as a metallurgist and consultant in mining. Back in 2004, he served as an expert witness in court, leading to estimated gold reserve of ~2,000,000 troy ounces – valuing the project at ~USD $3,870,000,000. Fast forward to today, the premise of this asset is a revival of a pre-existing mine that has yet to undergo modern extraction methods for ore removal. The potential for unearthing substantial amounts of gold hidden beneath the ground remains high, given the lack of advanced extraction techniques applied thus far. With basic systems in place for them to economically remove gold in the past 150 years, it’s likely there’s large amounts that have been missed. Processes like geological surveys, geochemical sampling, geophysical surveys, geological remodelling, additional exploration drilling programs could certainly expand the resource. However STAL’s Troy Mining asset will require updates to get back into production. The good news is it won’t demand the colossal capital investment typical of junior explorers, which commonly cost hundreds of millions. Here’s what we’re aware of that would be costs associated to update critical infrastructure on the property:

~USD $10 million for road and trail maintenance, ~USD $1.8 million for ore processing equipment ~USD $12,000 for two on-site generators connected to electrical panels. Addressing these infrastructure needs will be a crucial part of STAL’s forward journey, but should be fairly straight forward in comparison to standard junior mining exploration – will cost substantially less too. This leads us to our next topic involving a new recovery system management acquired called “Genesis Gold Extraction System”

Conclusion:

STAL’s market valuation of around $2M appears to be quite low when compared to the estimated resource at their Troy Mining project, valued at ~$4B. Shareholders could gain substantial value if management successfully reactivates the Troy Mining Asset. Given their new technology and minimal capital expenditure needed to revive the mine, it seems like a relatively straightforward task. Given the lengthiness of the article already, we didn’t include information about their Honduras Gold Mine, which is also quite impressive and adds substantial value to STAL. You can conveniently find all the essential details on that project in their corporate presentation, accessible here. Most importantly, STAL can leverage their innovative Genesis technology to not only enhance the economics in both their mining assets, but also benefit neighboring mines within the region’s highly concentrated mineral-rich vein belts. As per usual with stocks of this nature, details can change very quickly. Be sure to add STAL to your watchlist to keep a close eye on developments.

18,Alaska Energy Metals Unveils High-Grade Prospects at Canwell Zone in Nikolai Nickel Project,"Today, Alaska Energy Metals (Ticker: AEMC.v or AKEMF for US investors) unveiled promising results from its Canwell Property, a key component of the Nikolai Nickel Project situated in Alaska. 

The company's President & CEO, Gregory Beischer, expressed enthusiasm about the findings, emphasizing the significance of both surface rock sampling assays and geophysical surveys.

https://preview.redd.it/jb7dyouesiac1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=defba8bbbc8f222dd588ab140ea4506c2877c279

https://twitter.com/lbrice978/status/1742958282204221838?s=20

During the summer of 2023, AEMC conducted extensive rock sampling, revealing three highly prospective areas for high-grade mineralization: Canwell, Odie, and Emerick. 

The Canwell prospect, in particular, demonstrated surface rock sample assay results surpassing 5% nickel and 5% copper. 

Notably, the sulfide mineralization discovered is enriched in platinum group elements, adding another layer of strategic importance to the project.

The geophysical surveys on the Canwell Property showed strong conductive zones with magnetic highs beneath surface nickel-copper anomalies.

Gregory Beischer highlighted the significance of the geophysical program results, indicating a potential extension of high-grade mineralization beneath the surface, beyond historical drilling. 

AEMC plans to capitalize on this by conducting high-potential drilling in 2024 at the Canwell, Odie, and Emerick prospects. 

In conjunction with the Canwell Property, the Eureka Property, forming the Nikolai Nickel Project, also underwent CSAMT surveys. The correlation between CSAMT results and known mineralization at the Eureka Zone further supports the exploration strategy.

**Apple joins the AIGC** **trend**

The Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s machine learning research team has released a blog post showing a new generative AI technology, HUGS, which can analyze short videos in 30 minutes and then map to create new actions and angles.

HUGS, known as Human Gaussian Splats, uses machine learning and computer vision to create realistic portrait elements with less original input data.

Apple’s official introduction says that neural rendering technology has made great progress, with HUGS using 3D Gaussian Splatting technology to create mobile humans in the scene. Apple claims that the system has been trained to “unwind the static scenes and a fully animatable human avatar in 30 minutes”.

**AIGC innovation brings competitions among**

Nvidia (NVDA) is undoubtedly one of the big winners in the generative AI competition. The company has become a major supplier in the generative AI industry, and the GPU it sells is the only choice for any company that intends to make success in the AI generative model field. In November, Nvidia introduced the latest high-end chip, the H200, which will bring further performance leaps to AI models.

In addition, recently, the so-called “comprehensive crushing GPT-4” Google (GOOG) Gemini AI model appeared, coupled with Apple’s high-profile addition of AIGC, also reflects the field of “generative AI” is increasingly fierce. According to the latest report released by IDC Consulting, more than 87% of industry users worldwide have launched the application and deployment of generated AI.

According to the latest report of IDC, an international information research agency, global generative AI spending will reach $143 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 73.3%. There will be a new world for generative AI in the next few years. All kinds of data show that generative AI is accelerating into the implementation stage from the strategic planning period, and the application innovation of thousands of industries has ushered in the time window of explosion.

Industry insiders admit that with the rapid development of AIGC technology with big model technology as the core, the iPhone moment of the AI era has officially come, and AI is moving from the era of deep learning to the era of big model. More importantly, the new technology paradigm is redefining the landing mode of generative AI applications, accelerating the comprehensive intelligent upgrading of enterprises, and will also bring new changes in the development and operation of traditional AI applications.

75,Unearthing Lithium Treasures with Li-FT's Latest Drilling Success,"Li-FT Power Ltd. is making waves in the lithium sector with exciting updates from the Yellowknife Lithium Project. Wishing everyone a fantastic weekend - take some time off from those charts! Enjoy the latest scoop on LIFFF. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

[Image relating to mining news](https://imgur.com/a/3DUQEHj)

Think of a massive underground rock, like the ones in adventure movies, but this one's loaded with spodumene, a lithium-rich mineral. Why care about spodumene? Well, it's a key source of lithium, and lithium is what powers our phones, laptops, and electric cars. Li-FT has been drilling down into the Earth near Yellowknife and hit a jackpot - a long stretch of 23 meters with a high concentration of lithium (1.50% Li2O)​​.

This particular treasure trove is known as the Fi Southwest pegmatite. Picture a network of these lithium-filled rocks sprawling over a kilometer on the surface, all weaving their way underground. Li-FT's been testing different parts of this subterranean network, finding lithium consistently along the way​​.

But the Fi Southwest isn't their only golden goose. There's also the Nite and BIG West pegmatite complexes. Imagine them as part of the same underground labyrinth, each with its own riches. The Nite complex stretches over a kilometer and is up to 200 meters wide. BIG West is another major find, with a corridor over 1.5 kilometers long. Drilling in these areas is turning up impressive lithium oxide percentages - 1.51% and 1.07% over certain lengths. These figures are pretty significant in the mineral exploration world​​.

In short, Li-FT's findings are more than just numbers; they're potential game-changers for the tech and renewable energy sectors. It's this kind of exploration that could fuel our tech-driven, green future.

88,Hash function mapping questions,"Hey all, I have a couple questions about things I assume are true about hash functions, but I am not certain about, and I'd appreciate some confirmation, clarification, or pointed towards where to learn more if possible.

1. As an example, if given a 256 bit hash function, I assume that there is a 1-1 mapping of all 256 bit inputs to different 256 bit hash functions.
2. For inputs longer than 256 bits, the hash value of all possible inputs of the same length provides a uniform distribution over the 256 bit hash space.

Now I know it is not practical to brute force test these assumptions. Are these true? and if so, is there a fundamental property of hash functions that forces this?",1705249612,818618,andrew_wu_tech,t2_fccrk6ww,8055c6baf59e0426637ed761e25a17dc84a80c3b7fd155966a20cc7c3f8e4a89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/196jnlw/hash_function_mapping_questions/

105,"Tech market brings important development opportunities, AIGC is firmly top 1 in the current technology field"," 

The year of 2023 has been a unique year for AI which occured countless product launches, power changes within the company, and the race to launch the next major AIGC innovation.

Currently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been huge success, prompting each major technology company to release its own version. Large technology companies have fully invested in the development of generative AI, and various AI models have emerged, such as Meta (META) LLaMA 2, Google’s (GOOG) Bard chatbot and Gemini

In addition, generative AI allows artificial intelligence technology to develop, bringing a historical turning point in the large-scale adoption of machine learning. The new round of technological revolution initiated by generative AI is far beyond the imagination of ordinary people today, which means that a huge historical opportunity is coming.

From an application point of view, various applications derived from generative AI are gradually trying to land in various industries, including art generation, text generation, music generation, and more complex tasks, such as video generation and virtual reality environment generation. Generative AI-based knowledge base search, text summary, content, or code creation takes productivity to a new stage.

Generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) is firmly top 1 in the current technology field, and AIGC represents a new trend of AI technology development. In the past, traditional AI favored analytical capabilities, but now AI is generating new content, making a leap from perceptual understanding of the world to creating the world. According to the prediction of industry insiders, from 2024, it will enter the era of generative AI applications, and even become the 2.0 era of changing traditional industries.

Generated AI will contribute about $7 trillion to the global economy and increase the overall economic benefits of AI by about 50 percent, according to data released by leading consultancy McKinsey. According to the “Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends of 2024” released by global IT research and consulting firm Gartner, by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will be connected to generative AI or large models, but the proportion is less than 5% at the beginning of 2023.

**Companies began to compete in the AI field**

Due to the rise of generative AI, especially the application of large language model, is fundamentally change the operation of technology industry, industry technology is driven by AI into a new era, this will prompt generative AI and industry model technology, no longer limited to the boundary of the industry, become an important strategic development direction of technology giants.

In January, Microsoft released Azure OpenAI services by combining Azure’s enterprise capabilities with OpenAI’s generative AI model capabilities; in March, Google opened the API of the AI big model PaLM and introduced generative AI into Google’s enterprise online collaboration platform Google Workspace.

Amazon (AMZN) entered generative AI a little later than Microsoft and Google, but the company has not followed the two giants, taking a new approach. According to the news, Amazon recently announced the launch of a number of blockbuster releases around the theme of reconstructing cloud infrastructure, computing, storage, and enterprise generated AI, to help cloud customers quickly realize digital transformation and improve the speed of enterprise generated AI innovation.

In addition, Amazon has introduced five new Amazon SageMaker features that make it easier and faster for enterprises to build, train and deploy machine learning models that support a variety of generative AI usage scenarios, enabling customers to easily integrate generative AI into their workflow.

According to public information, WiMi Hologram Cloud is committed to cutting-edge research and development in the field of artificial intelligence, and constantly expands its application scope. It has excellent technical strength and rich experience in application scenarios. Now, generative AI is becoming a hot spot in the industry. WiMi Hologram Cloud will use existing AI models and technical strength, and use new AIGC technology to empower various industries, so as to provide more intelligent solutions and help vertical industries complete the development of digital intelligence, so as to achieve comprehensive empowerment.

&#x200B;

The emergence of AIGC is bringing disruptive changes to every industry, leading all industries to an era of efficiency. It is foreseeable that AIGC is both an important opportunity and an inevitable trend. With the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, the capability and quality of AIGC are also constantly improving.

115,"Apple’s MR headset mass production started, Meta creates XR + AI innovative virtual office experience"," 

According to the latest news, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) will officially produce the first generation of hybrid reality product Vision Pro in December, with the first batch of about 40 0,000 units, which is expected to go on sale in early 2024. According to the plan, the sales target for Vision Pro is 1 million units in 2024 and 10 million units in the third year.

The Vision Pro, Apple’s first headset, released in June, is a new generation of electronics with multiple cameras, gestures, eyes or voice to work, play, and communicate. As Apple’s blockbuster in XR, Vision Pro is seen as a milestone in the development of consumer electronics.

**MR will bring smart changes to the office**

Mixed Reality is a combination of VR and AR technology, which makes users get information in ways of supplement and superposition. Industry insiders pointed out that the Apple MR headset device in interaction, device collaboration, application and other aspects of outstanding performance, is expected to promote the industry into a new round of upward cycle.

Southwest Securities believes that after the release of Apple MR, its visual experience and augmented reality scene function improvement is expected to upgrade the positioning of XR devices from games to office / life, and become a new generation of office and entertainment consumer electronic devices after PC and mobile phones. It is expected that Apple MR market space will reach 100 billion yuan by 2025.

**Meta Quest 3 Office experience**

At the same time, the combination of XR and AI hardware and hard is the general trend. At the end of September, US Internet technology company Meta unveiled its new XR headset Quest 3 product and smart glasses co-branded with Lei Peng, AI image generation model EMU and LIama 2-based AI chatbot Meta AI to promote XR + AI to optimize user use.

In terms of product parameters, the Quest 3 is like a leapfrog product, with a depth sensor. Meta says its perspective resolution is three times higher than the Quest Pro.

According to people familiar with the matter, in the recent Quest 3 XR office experience, the use scenarios mainly include three categories: the use of cloud documents based on the web environment, the use of streaming computer with picture editing tools lacking in the headset, and the use of office software dedicated to XR platform.

If it was previously said that XR office is a gimmick greater than the actual application scenario, then now after the office experience discovery based on Quest 3 and the official release of Apple MR, XR office does have a certain practicality in some scenarios. It can be imagined that under the guidance of the head enterprises, the XR industry chain office ecology will continue to be enriched and upgraded, and become a key entrance to the yuan-universe era is still worth looking forward to.

With the arrival of Vision Pro product cycle, listed companies in the industrial chain have also attracted great attention from the capital market. In addition, the development of telecommuting is promoting the popularity of the universe. WiMi Hologram Cloud With 5G and the implementation of AI and other technical capabilities, application demonstration zones will be set up to optimize the office meeting scenarios. This may help to turn the unique XR office and conference experience into reality, provide users with a complete ecosystem of large-screen and multi-screen collaboration, and improve the office ecosystem experience. WiMi Hologram Cloud It will also further differentiate and innovate in AR operation and AI interactive experience to meet the diversified needs of future office scenarios.

Overall, XR technology is changing rapidly and will play a key role in the digital age. XR technology shows the scene of the future office, which has great potential to impact on the status of the future office, where people can do the work better and more intuitively through virtual display devices. Looking into the future, XR will be the commanding point of a new round of industrial transformation, and will gradually penetrate into every aspect of public life.

118,3 Lab-Grown Meat Stocks to Watch After Israel's Greenlight to Aleph Farms $STKH $BYNd $TSN,"With Israel's recent regulatory approval for Aleph Farms' cultivated beef, the spotlight is now on the lab-grown meat industry. 

https://preview.redd.it/on0z6oo3o0dc1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=50f8d27383565357a3dae85921a1a25a05bcb54e

***This got me thinking about potential  opportunities in this sector. Here are three companies i'm watching:***

1. **Steakholder Foods (NASDAQ: STKH)**: This Israeli-based company just got a lot more interesting. They're the first publicly traded company in the lab-grown meat space and have seen some impressive achievements recently including multi million contracts with GCC Governmental body and UAE regulatory path. Not to mention tech advancements. 
2. **Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN)**: A familiar name, Tyson has been making moves into lab-grown meat by investing in companies like Beyond Meat and Upside Foods. They're leveraging their meat industry expertise to support the scale-up of lab-grown meat production. 
3. **Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND)**: Known for its plant-based meat substitutes, Beyond Meat is a significant player in the alternative protein industry. Though not a pure-play lab-grown meat company, their plant-based approach is closely aligned with the industry's sustainable goals. They've seen some ups and downs in stock performance, but they're definitely worth watching.

The lab-grown meat industry is still in its infancy, but with growing environmental and ethical concerns, it could be poised for significant growth. What do you guys think? Are these stocks a good bet for the future of meat?

119,What market trends are you BULLISH on in 2024?,"Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard

 **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)** The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )** Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. 

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )** The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

121,Why Uranium might print money in 2024 - Looking for feedback on this thesis!,"The past week I've been diving deep into the uranium market ( I'm obviously an expert now) . I don't want to become a millionare by myself, so here's a TLDR on what I've learned so far: 

**Headline:**

* **Uranium has a supercycle where the price absolutely sky rockets. It happened in the 70s. It happened in 2008. On friday the next one started.** 

**Why the conditions are primed for a big bull market:** 

* **Supply of uranium is becoming more constrained**, **and there is no help coming.** 
   * Production has fallen over the past few years because prices were so low. 
   * Utilities and producers have not maintained adequate secondary supplies because they got lazy and everyone was down on nuclear power. 
   * Major Uranium producers (Cameco, Kazatomprom) are having production issues and are going to need to buy uranium from the spot market to fulfill contracts. Bad for them. Good for us. Price of uranium will go to the moon. 
   * There are no major mines slated to open until 2027. The eagles are not coming. 
* **Demand for uranium is spiking and it's only going to accelerate** 
   * Current mining production capacity cannot meet demand requirements. Utilities have been burning through their excess uranium supply. 
   * Nuclear power plants have been opening up around the world and investment in nuclear energy is rapidly increasing. 

**So what does this mean?**

* Go big on uranium. This has happened in the past. It's still VERY early and there's a lot of bull market left. 
* Utilities and mining companies will need to buy physical uranium in the spot market. Trusts like Sprott Physical Uranium Trust that have been buying up shit tones of uranium for this very reason, and the price of uranium is going to sky rocket (hopefully making us rich). 
* Mining companies will see dollar signs with high uranium prices and start increasing mining operations (this will take years to impact supply), BUT the value of uranium mining companies will spike. (You can invest in individual mining companies like Denison Mines, Nexgen, Atomic, or in uranium mining ETF's like URNM). 

**Resources:**

* [John Quakes on Twitter](https://x.com/quakes99?s=20)\- Solid updates
* [Uranium insider](https://twitter.com/uraniuminsider) \- Great analysis on uranium and uranium equities 
* [Yellow bull on twitter](https://x.com/Yellowbull11?s=20) \- Uranium investor with good updates + insight 
* Google Uranium Squeeze. There is a solid community that's been tracking this for the past 2-3 years. Perfect time for us to swoop and steal all the profits.

The Company plans on releasing  its AI search engine to the public in Q1 2024 for general use and  charging on a per use basis which could contribute significantly to the  Company’s growth in 2024.

 **Brief overview of the company :** 

Nextech3D.ai is committed to empowering businesses to evolve and become part of the new 3D and AR ecosystem. 

Nextech3D.ai     is the leading solution provider for AI-based 3D and AR  technology.    It  is the parent company of cutting-edge brands -  Toggle3D.ai,    ARitize3D,  ARway.ai, and Map D.

Distinguished      by its strategic approach, the company identifies and develops      disruptive technologies, subsequently spinning them out as independent      public entities. This innovative strategy involves issuing stock      dividends to shareholders while retaining a substantial ownership stake      in the spun-out companies.

As       global interest in AR for e-commerce continues to rise,   Nextech3D.ai's     services are increasingly valuable, providing a   robust runway for     sustained growth. The company is poised to become   the premier AR     investment opportunity, making it an attractive   prospect for investors     seeking to participate in the   commercialization of AI technology.

NexTech3D.ai, an emerging company in the world of commerce  worth over 5 trillion dollars and constantly growing. Nextech3D.ai not  only provides photorealistic 3D models for major e-commerce retailers,  but has its own transformational Ai technology, in order to lead it to  be a leader in its field and gain significant market share in the years  to come. Nextech3D.ai has obtained several significant validations from  multiple parts of the world from several major resellers.  
Owner of 3  subsidiaries operating in different sectors of augmented reality (3D  events, navigation and wayfinding, 3D design studio, 3D and AR models,  and much more), Nextech3D.ai is able to take a unique advantage of the  upcoming release of the glasses ar and the interest that will follow  from companies and consumers. I consider Nextech3D.ai currently  undervalued based on its current fundamentals and the uniqueness of what  it offers, without considering the assets of its subsidiaries that it  owns.  
Quote Benjamin Graham: Seize the opportunities the market  presents to you to take advantage of its temporary irrationality. The  real profit is made at the moment of purchase.

164,[DD] $HIMS: helping your portfolio rise like it helps millions of men rise 🚀🚀,"**TLDR:** Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE: HIMS), a leading health and wellness platform, is a stock you need to have on your radar. With a massive 57% Y-o-Y revenue increase, revolutionary AI tech, and a strategy that's grabbing market share like a black hole, HIMS will make your portfolio feel like its customers.

**1. Revenue Growth that Defies Gravity:** HIMS reported a jaw-dropping 57% increase in revenue year-over-year for Q3 2023, hitting $226.7 million. The company's online channel (the core of its business) showed an equivalent growth spurt. This isn't just growth; it's hyper-growth.

**2. Subscriber Surge:** HIMS isn't just getting customers; they're building an army. Subscriber base jumped by over 125,000 in just one quarter, surpassing 1.4 million. This isn’t just people buying products; it's a growing community of HIMS addicts.

**3. Gross Margins to Make You Drool:** Gross margins expanded to a mouth-watering 83%, thanks to economies of scale and operational efficiency. This isn’t just good; it’s SaaS-level good.

**4. MedMatch:** Your AI Doctor: HIMS is deploying an AI-powered service called MedMatch. This isn't your average AI; it’s a game-changer. MedMatch is trained on millions of anonymized historical clinical visits and is set to significantly improve patient outcomes, particularly in mental health, by reducing the trial-and-error process in treatment.

**5. The Weight Loss Drug Play:** HIMS is about to make a grand entrance into the weight loss drug market. They're rolling out a comprehensive weight management offering, leveraging generic pharmaceutical treatments at mass-market pricing. This move could be a game-changer, tapping into the massive weight loss market with affordable, effective solutions. Given HIMS’s track record in healthcare innovation, their weight loss drug could be the next big thing in the industry, combining affordability with effectiveness.

**6. Vertical Integration = Power:** HIMS is moving towards fulfilling nearly all orders through its affiliated pharmacies. This vertical integration means more control, better margins, and a unique edge in the market. By the end of 2023, they expect almost all orders to be fulfilled this way.

**7. Financial Muscle:** HIMS's balance sheet is stronger than a bodybuilder on supplements. They're so confident in their intrinsic value that they're implementing a $50 million stock repurchase program over the next two years. Also this company has NO DEBT.

**8. Looking Forward:** The guidance for Q4 2023 and the full year screams bullish. They're expecting revenue between $243 million to $248 million in Q4, with the full year forecast to be between $868 million to $873 million. And guess what? They’re eyeing their first positive net income by early 2024. That's a company transitioning from a high-growth phase to a profitable juggernaut.

**9. The Valuation Disconnect:** Here's where it gets interesting for investors. HIMS management expects to achieve a ~25% adjusted EBITDA margin long-term, a figure well within reach given their current gross margin of 83%. However, the stock market is pricing HIMS as if it's only going to hit a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin of around 10%. This discrepancy suggests a significant undervaluation. If HIMS reaches its margin potential, there's a huge upside waiting to be unlocked.

**Conclusion:** Moon 🚀🌕

This expansion highlights the scalability of MBAI's MedMatrix Platform within the massive 200 billion dollar addressable healthcare market. It also highlights the ability for MBAI to scale the deployment and number of users of their Medmatrix platform rapidly.   
Despite MBAI's Market Cap being less than 22M they have already signed on 14 clinics within 2 months, including a Yale School of Medicine Affiliated Clinic Group. 

Rejuvenation, with its extensive network of 8 clinics spanning across 3 provinces in Canada, has positioned itself as a key player in dermatological care. Boasting a highly skilled team comprising 21 dermatologists, 5 Mohs surgeons, 2 plastic surgeons, and 13 general practitioners specializing in dermatology, Rejuvenation is set to leverage MedMatrix for an expanded scope, particularly in the realms of cosmetic marketing and clinical trial analytics.

The addition of clinical trial recruitment tools to MedMatrix will empower Rejuvenation to swiftly assess patient eligibility for clinical trials. This not only improves patient access to cutting-edge treatments but also streamlines the clinical trial recruitment process for Rejuvenation’s partners.

Trevor Vieweg, the CEO of MedBright AI, expressed enthusiasm about the extended collaboration, stating, “We are excited to expand our work with Rejuvenation to further improve their already impressive operations in cosmetic treatment marketing and clinical trials. Combining the power of MedMatrix with the large patient base of Rejuvenation is set to provide new opportunities for Rejuvenation and improve the patient experience for their customers.”

As MedBright AI continues to allocate capital and invest strategically in healthcare technology, this collaboration underscores its commitment to fostering synergies and generating superior returns for shareholders.

The company remains focused on identifying significant, high-quality opportunities with strong return potentials while upholding a steadfast commitment to governance. MedBright AI's mission is clear – to construct a portfolio of investments that not only align with their strategic vision but also contribute to the advancement of healthcare technology on a global scale.

First up we have $AKEMF that just broke out of its bull flag. It is pulling back and testing the bull flag which is very typical. I will definitely be watching the bounce here. However, I must admit that I am a little concerned with the volume. I wish it was a little bit higher, but It looks like the uptrend will continue.

194,"Retrace Inbound? 1-24-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis (Tesla Earnings)","  

I love to bring you guys “fun facts” about the market (or at least what I find to be fun). There is no doubt that tech has been driving this market but its kinda surprising to hear that tech has drove this market so far that they are outperforming small caps by the largest margin since the DotCom Bubble… perhaps there is an AI bubble after all? Not only that this is the first time in the history of the stock market that we have seen large cap stocks hit ATHs while small cap stocks remain in a bear market…

Tomorrow is a huge day (along with Friday) for data. We have a GDP and jobless claims which going into FOMC next week could move the markets. While I don’t see anything happening about a rate cut expectation for the January meeting this could start to be the data that humbles the market.

**TESLA EARNINGS**

While a lot of people like to discount tesla when it comes to big market moves and pushing ES/ NQ around this might be the catalyst bears finally needed (along with the VIX pump and 10yr/dxy movements and massive daily rejection today) to finally see a meaningful retrace. Truly though as I have said a few times over the last week or two… if the bears do not take control right now and dump this then likely there is no stopping this bull train until something breaks and breaks in a big way. 

I was looking at sub 200 on earnings day for TSLA and now I have a bigger weekly target of $165. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bzz2ic7cmgec1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeca8ec729b0db37d834bd25320b3079aedad753

Monday night I said that the daily technical patterns were extremely bearish and I fully expected a retrace overnight… as much as it pains me to say it again… we have officially set up the ideal bearish reversal conditions again. This is about as strong of a rejection as one could want. I do forsee a potential sell off to back test daily 8ema support headed FOMC. 

We officially lost buying support on the daily time frame and we did get a new daily supply today at 484.89, however, this is an imbalanced close due to the fact that we closed over the supply which should be resistance. 

To balance this bears either need to close us under that supply tomorrow (likely scenario) or bulls need to bounce us high enough to turn support into demand (very bullish). 

This is bears best shot at a retrace and potential big drop tomorrow. The target for the bears is the daily 8ema support of 482.4 (projected). If bears can close under 8ema support there is a short at a bigger retrace to the 20ema support near 477.88-478.12 projected area which is also where our double supplies sit. 

IF and when we get a new demand is likely the next long opportunity for a run back to ATHs for bulls.

This is a massive doji rejection here on the daily with a new supply and a daily double top. Truly if this does not have a meaningful retrace tomorrow then there is just nothing stopping this bull run. While anything can happen… with tesla earnings and the technicals of the daily I will be surprised to not see a red day tomorrow (especially considering SPY closed 5 green days today). 

Bears will look to use this opportunity to back test the daily 8ema support near 4860 (projected). IF they can close under 8ema support our bigger target will be the 20ema support near the 4813-4836 double supply area.

Here on Qs it yet again is another massive gap up overnight and a massive rejection. This is the 3rd major gap up left on the daily chart in the last 6 days. 

We also got a new supply on Qs at 423.51 (our double top from yesterday). This too is an imbalanced close as we closed well over what should be resistance. We once again saw daily buyers weaken here. 

Bears have a real opportunity for a big gap down tomorrow to play out the abandoned baby pattern. They also have a real shot at a drop to daily 8ema support near 420 (projected). If we break through the daily 8ema support we could see the daily 20ema support near 412 (projected).

Very similar rejection here on NQ as Monday. I will be curious to see if the daily reversal doji can finally play out or if once again the bulls buy this up. With an imbalance close here at 17551 supply I am looking for bears to drop us back under that level tomorrow. It would have been more bearish if we could have the daily double top doji just like ES. 

Bears are going to shoot for the daily 8ema here which will be near 17400 (projected). If they break through the 8ema support we will likely target 20ema support near 17133 (projected) which is also supply.

After opening up almost 1% down the 10yr had a massive reversal today. It had a hard bounce off the daily 8ema support of 4.11% and finally broke through and closed over 4.148% which was supply and the daily 50ema resistance. We also got a new demand today at 4.13%.

Now that US10YR has broken out and holds its bull channel in tact it will look for a move up to the 4.207% and eventually 4.289% area. This should once again bring weakness to markets tomorrow and once again we have perfect opposing (congruence) patterns here. 

US10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.146% -> 4.207% -> 4.289%

On DXY we have a bit of a indecisive pattern. On one hand we had a massive bounce off the daily 20ema support of 102.879 and we continue to hold the daily 8/20ema support area of 103.194. 

However, we did wick through the daily bull channel and we also once again failed to push through 103.55 resistance area. 

This is a potential daily doji reversal candle though which could with the ES/ NQ and 10YR Yield daily candles all agree of a potential downside on markets tomorrow. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 102.447 -> 103.393 -> 104.083

While the VIX is absolutely on my naughty list and I don’t pay it much attention lately… the one thing I do find very important is the fact that the VIX had yet again (3rd time in just over a month) a hard double bottom bounce off previous 12.44 daily demand. It also got a new daily demand put in at 12.55. 

The last two times we had daily double bottom bounces off the 12.44 area we have had a strong retracement on SPY. 

December 28/29th bounce on VIX led to a 2.4% drop on SPY over 5 days. 

January 11th/ 12th bounce on VIX led to a 1.82% drop on SPY over 3 days. 

Both of these bounces took us to the daily 20ema support also. We could be in store for a drop 4 day drop of about 2%. This would take SPY down (from high) to about $479 by Tuesday the 30th. Projection wise if we slowly sell off over 3-5 days the daily 20ema support will be right about $479 by time we get there. This also perfectly takes us into FOMC. 

IF this takes us into FOMC we could  see a muti day sell off that then puts the direction of the market in the hands of JPOW. If JPOW comes out hawk powell (he should) then we could finally get the bigger correction of 5-10% so many have been waiting for. However, if JPOW once again comes to the market this daily 20ema support bounce likely is the bounce bulls need to punch out to $5000ES and $500SPY.

Today once again, just like Monday into Tuesday, we had extremely bearish technicals on the daily but of course were met with a green push overnight and at open. We did however get a big flush today. Despite that big flush today SPY still closed out its 6th green day in a row. Something it has not done since December 7th through 14th. Can bears finally send this lower tomorrow or do technicals just not matter anymore?

We remain imbalanced here on the SPY daily and continue to see daily buyers weaken. With this little upside push and green day we did turn previous supply into demand now at 485.38.  

The window of opportunity for a retrace to at least the daily 8ema support near 482.2 (projected) remains. 

However, this is one of the strongest buy the dip markets and completely ignore everything we have ever seen. I mean truly fundamentals, technicals, macro, economics, etc. don’t even appear to matter to the markets right now. Certainly seems like we are in some unprecedented times here. 

Bears will now need to take this below 485.38 to have an opportunity at a bigger sell off here. If they cant break below these levels then likely we are going to see a bigger breakout or at least hold steady here and consolidate. 

Bulls will look to continue to tick away at ATHs.

We once again had a beautiful daily doji double top with a new supply to potentially send this down to the daily 8ema support and bears completely failed to use that opportunity. 

We also turned supply into demand here now at 4900 and still have daily buyers coming in to support the upside. We also are entering extreme bull momentum on the daily here now. 

Bears now need to close minimally under 4900 to have any hopes of a drop to the daily 8ema support near 4875 (projected).

In an abnormal technical pattern that I usually only see on something like the VIX we actually have a daily bearish engulfing candle of the previous days green candle. We could not quite push a new ATHs today and much like SPY we continue to see daily buyers weaken. 

We did, however, not turn supply into demand like SPY/ ES did. But we still remain imbalanced as we did not close under 423.51.

Bears need to push this under 423.51 and still seek a drop to the daily 8ema support near 419.9 (projected). 

Bulls will need to see daily buyers come back in tomorrow and push a new ATHs to put a new demand in and push this higher.

Much like QQQ here on NQ we are starting to see little bits of weakness as we saw daily buyers weaken here. We did not turn supply into demand and we actually closed out another daily doji candle. While yesterday doji was bearish its once again hard to deny that back to back dojis look very bearish. 

Its once again the question of will markets ignore technicals or not? 

Bears will look to close us under 17751 to rebalance and touch the daily 8ema support near 17390 (projected). 

Bulls will look to bounce higher, have daily buyers come back in and put in a new demand to turn this consolidation into bullishness.

On the 10YR we had a really strong rejection once again off the upside and now we put in a new supply at 4.177%. We are once again sandwhiched between the daily 8 and 50ema levels but defended yesterdays 4.13% demand. 

Bulls need to see the 10yr drop through the 8ema support and preferably the 20ema support of 4.072%. 

Bears will attempt to defend the daily 8ema support again and make another run at 4.177% and 4.207%.

Much like the 10yr we continue to consolidate in this same tighter range here. We couldn’t quite breakout today but also did a great job of defending the daily 8 and 50ema supports again while putting in a new daily demand at 103.246.

Bears need to see a breakout over 103.68 area and target a bigger breakout to 104.083-104.165.

Bulls need to see a hard rejection here with a new daily supply and most importantly a closure under the daily 8/50/ 20ema supports of 103.004 to break this red bull channel.

VIX once again gets a notable mention today as we had continued to bounce to the upside putting in decent green day here on the VIX despite also a green day on the markets. 

With the VIX now back over the daily 8/20ema resistance I do expect the VIX to continue to push to the triple supply area of 14.86-15.31.

This has the potential still like the last two times to cause a decent sell off in this market but this market continues to be resilient and refuse to sell off. Keeping a close eye on the VIX the rest of the week.

The bulls tried their hardest but after 6 green days in a row on SPY the bears finally on day 7 were able to close a red day. 12 of the last 13 weeks on SPY have closed green which is truly an incredible bullish move for these markets. The question now is will bulls continue this trend up or are we finally in store for a bigger correction?

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3xb4dr6ab2fc1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2195de95c55d80cb39f6f2735746495ffcf2e5

This market continues to adjust its expectations for 2024. As of now we are seeing a sizeable change from 100% odds of easing from March through EOY meeting to now markets not expecting their first rate cut till May 2024. Now the markets still are pricing in 6 rate cuts which is double what the FED hinted at during the December FOMC meeting. This is going to be an interesting meeting to watch how the market reacts to what JPOW has to say. 

The FED (JPOW) is backed into a corner here in my opinion and heres why. JPOW said since inflation was on a downward trajectory and as long as that maintained that they for the first time would be comfortable with rate cuts in 2024 with the median fed dot plot forecast being about three total rate cuts by EOY. This was huge because this was the first time that the fed had agreed with markets (markets were already expecting rate cuts). However, what jpow perhaps didn’t expect was that the markets would hear three rate cuts and say actually how about 6 maybe 7 rate cuts. However, things have changed as we did get a rebound in CPI at the last meeting. Keep in mind the fed is NOT forward looking but only make decisions off the data that is in front of them. JPOW perhaps could come out confident and beat his chest a bit saying that the fed has conquered inflation and this was merely a one off bounce (which forward looking data currently confirms). However, we could see a bit more hawkish JPOW here that says inflation rebounding is a concern for the fed and that put a rate hike back on the table. 

Truly in a way this meeting also doesn’t matter and heres why. Its 100% odds we get a continuation of the pause and we do not get a new updated dot plot expectation here. We also will get two more CPI meetings before the March FOMC meeting (next fed meeting as there is not one in February). If data indeed continues to unwind on CPI and we see confirmation that this was a one off bounce we very well could see our first rate cut in March. However, if CPI holds steady or even worse rebounds higher there is zero chance of a rate cut and we could easily see the fed dot plot completely walk back all of its dovishness in March. 

**EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nf7hlpab2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b3fd755c565237c10e4a8f2ed09444bd18b536

Tuesday (night before FOMC) we have three major earnings reporting from MSFT, AMD and Google. This could make an extremely volatile pre-FOMC overnight move. The other notable earnings come Thursday night (day after FOMC) with Apple, META and Amazon all reporting. 

**CALENDAR**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u75vmy2bb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22f20f6d6f2711992fd3a26b08f3867e9d3a867

Honestly looking at this week with 6 major earnings reporting, FOMC meeting and some heavy hitting data this is going to be a very spicy and volatile week. I feel confident that one way or another this week coming up is going to push us in a direction and I wouldn’t be surprised to see us trade that direction for a few weeks. 

Tuesday we get JOLTS data. 

Wednesday (pre market FOMC Day) we have ADP non farm. 

Thursday (day after FOMC) we have challenge job cuts, non farm and jobless claims. 

Friday will be unemployment rate, non farm, and U of M inflation expectations. 

This is some heavy hitting data which I expect to cause some solid movement this week trading wise. I think much of this weeks issues trade wise came from the fact that markets were just pinned in one stop and no one wanted to commit to a direction. Next week there is plenty of data, earnings and other events to cause Algos to pick a direction. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3l9k1pibb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3baa3dfb1ad4dfe2cfe847a82ecf06be367deb

SPY daily did put in a new supply at 487.98. This effectively has built a three day long range from 485.38 to 487.98. If we close under demand or over supply which ever comes first I expect that direction to have some momentum and steam. 

We are sitting just barely in extreme bull momentum on the daily here, however, we have not had buyers come in to support further upside for three days in a row now. One way to look at this is that the last supported closing price on SPY was at 484.86.

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pl9nnjxbb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ee1b5369629e471196c8f9c5c435860854053b

This is where once again the daily and weekly charts are not quite showing congruence. On the Daily we are once again seeing more consolidation while the weekly still shows quite a bit of bullishness. 

On the weekly we remain in extreme bull momentum and we continue to have weekly buyers to support this weekly close. 

Bulls will look to see a move to the 490-495 area and potentially as high as 500+ on the backs of FOMC and earnings. 

Bears will attempt to use any sort of weakness in earning or hawkishness in FOMC to minimally backtest the weekly 8ema support which will be right near the 475.46 supply (projected). 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 475.46

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

The ES daily here has entered a similar consolidation range of 4900 to 4919 after putting in a new supply off this daily double top doji rejection. 

Friday was the first day since 1/18/24 that we have not seen buyers support on the daily time frame. 

Bulls and bears have their clear support/ resistances to close over in order to move the market. Bulls will look to target 5000+ and bears will look to target 4850 this week. 

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tknk89zcb2fc1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=91db90d21239b6fc5c951ee8ff63fae680136284

Much like SPY the weekly here shows far more bullishness as we have once again had weekly buyers come in to support the upside move and we remain in weekly extreme bull momentum. 

Bulls will look to continue the upwards move with a target of 5000+ this week. 

Bears need to look for a window of weakness and attempt to back test the daily 8ema support which will be near 4800 (projected). 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4771

**QQQ DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gkch34gdb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c60d62f6f1dce79d765ec99c716ba40dce27f2d

QQQ daily remains imbalanced as we have still not closed back under 423.51 but this is the third day in a row that QQQ has failed to make a new high. We are also seeing the weakness buying, and the 5th day in a row that buyers support price, since 1/9/24. If buyers do not come back in soon here on the daily timeframe sellers have an opportunity to come in and take over. 

QQQ does remain in extreme daily bull momentum but is sitting directly on the edge of losing it with one more red day. 

**QQQ WEEKLY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z2bo54vdb2fc1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=001247b83a7739c8ebe12e92e51fc23ae41098f4

QQQ weekly closed out a nice gravestone doji candle and has formed a potential reversal on the weekly. On SPY we saw more bullish continuation on the day and bullishness to the weekly. On QQQ daily I am seeing more bearishness on the daily and a weekly candle that could confirm further downside also. 

This same candle pattern (with a smaller range) played out the week of 12/25/23 to 1/1/24 and resulted in a flush back down to the weekly 8ema support. 

Actually the only other weeks that QQQ has not had buyers were during those two weeks which resulted in the retrace. 

Bears are going to attempt to use this as an opportunity to move back to the weekly 8ema support near 410 (projected).

Bulls need to rebalance the market which a big push up next week to turn 421.21 supply into demand. If they can accomplish that we could see a major push up through the month of February. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVEL  
 Supply- 408.58 -> 421.21  
 Demand- 396.72

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ybm1fbeb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=454d73c687b355a57c13e85fb53f58cb7be0123e

Here on NQ daily we actually were able to get a rebalanced close back under 17551. We came close to the daily 8ema support but couldn’t quite get all the way down to 17405. However, this is the closed bears have taken us back to it in well over a week. That is a big line for bulls to defend next week. 

We continue to see buyers weaken on the daily and we are in danger of losing extreme bull momentum. 

I certainly see a potential bull flag pattern playing out here though. The only thing to invalidate that pattern would be a drop through the 8ema support. 

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4zdcjseb2fc1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df184bc524719d8fd0556951c86e34f78a2ce05

We have a slightly different NQ weekly chart compared to QQQ with a few similarities. Much like QQQ we got an imbalanced weekly close with a very textbook doji reversal candle. However, we did not see buyers weaken on the NQ weekly like we did on QQQ. 

Bulls will look to bounce off this 17474 supply to put in a sizeable green week and rebalance the markets by turning that supply into demand. Weekly extreme bull momentum continues to help the bulls. 

Bears will look to see buyers weaken early into the week and flush under the 17474 supply to backtest the weekly 8ema support near 17000 (projected). 

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16957 -> 17474  
 Demand- 16455

**VIX DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wb8l0b7fb2fc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=58985f1e09dff51603ede9a8d759e5b5e5f17af4

On the VIX here we continue to work on our third double bottom bounce off the 12.44 demand area. 

As mentioned earlier this week the last few times we have seen a bounce like this it has led to a 2% drop and a backtest of the daily 20ema supports (highlighted by white arrows). However, what I think is also important to mention is that the last two times we finally rejected the upside on the VIX (highlighted by orange arrows) SPY went on a 2.7%/ 7 day rally and a 4.15%/ 9 day rally. 

This sets us up again for a backtest of the daily 20ema support near 480.1- 480.2 this week. However, once that support touches and holds we could be looking at about a 3.4% rally over 8 days… That could have SPY seeing the $496 range by middle of February. 

The one thing that I see by this chart is that until we see the VIX break through and hold over 14.86-15.31 triple supply the VIX is just in a massive range. This almost 3 month long range on the VIX continuing will allow bulls to slow push this market higher and higher until we finally get such a violent pop on the VIX that the true correction happens. While I continue to find day to day the VIX to be useless right now, whenever the VIX finally pushes over 15.31 it will be time to pay attention and it will once again resume a place of usefulness. 

**US10YR YIELD WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0fk46ylfb2fc1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=0badd41758cd8b83b3f4c850aff724c9adde3aa0

There is still a textbook looking bear flag (bearish pattern) formed here on the US 10YR Yield weekly chart. However, if the 10YR can get a major push up and over 4.244% there is a chance that this could turn into a massive V- bottom and be a huger reversal (or potentially a huge cup and handle). 

The weekly 20ema resistance at 4.186% continues to be critical resistance that holds the 10YR from breaking out. However, at the same time the 10YR continues to hold the weekly 8/20ema support area of 4.111-4.009%.

I expect post FOMC and post heavy data this week to see a major breakout or breakdown on the 10YR Yield. 

Bulls will look to see the 10YR hard reject the 20ema resistance here and ideally close back under the 50ema support of 4.009% to confirm the bear flag. If the 10YR breaks down here this would be a huge opportunity for the bulls to rip ES/ NQ higher. 

Bears need to see a major push through the 20ema resistance of 4.188%. If the bears can move the 10YR back to the 4.225-4.244% area then we could see the cup and handle/ v bottom pattern play out on the weekly here with a potential more major breakdown to at least the daily 20ema support if not the daily 50ema support for ES/ NQ (much over due from a technical standpoint). 

US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.244%  
 Demand- 3.867% -> 4.225%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY**

The US dollar has a similar bear flag versus breakout to the upside pattern forming here. DXY has been on a steady bull channel move up for the last 5 weeks now, however the weekly 20/50ema resistance at 103.476- 103.666 continues to for two weeks in a row hold as major resistance. The weekly 8ema support of 103.014 after two weeks of rejections now is holding for two weeks as support. 

Bulls need to see the 20/ 50ema resistance continue to hold here and reject us hard enough to close back under that 8ema support of 103.014.

Bears will look to continue this 5 week breakout and push through at least the 50ema resistance of 103.666 but ideally a closure over 104.009 supply. This would break DXY out of a 10 week long range. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.009 -> 105.591

**CL/ OIL FUTURES WEEKLY**

This is where the market bulls and the markets expectations of 6 rate cuts are at extreme risk here. CPI has for the most part been following the trend of Oil for almost a year now. I had mentioned before last CPI that the fact that oil had held flat for almost 1.5 months straight put CPI at a risk of minimally being unchanged if not seeing a rebound to the upside and we of course got a rebound on last CPI. 

Now we are seeing a major breakout (with support) of this diamond pattern that has been brewing since the first week of December. With oil breaking out of the major 71-73.55 range it traded in for 7 weeks we could easily see a huge and sustained push to the upside here. 

This is the highest oil has been since 11/6 on a weekly close time frame. For reference the CPI that led into that drop on oil was 3.7% and we are currently sitting at 3.4%. If oil holds here and more importantly continues to breakout over the next 2-3 weeks I would not be surprised to see CPI continue to rise. 

This is the first weekly candle for oil that has had buyers since 10/23/23. We have a major shift on this weekly chart and a major breakout forming here.

On Friday I had to leave around 11am for an out of state competition for my daughter. I started two APEX evals that morning (they still have one day pass special until Monday at 5pm). I came close to passing those Evals but was not quite able to get it done. I certainly had a few opportunities but this week had been a rough one trading and all the chop. I wanted to go out on a positive note so I just called it a day there and went on my way. 

I did officially convert my previously passed evals to PAs but did not trade them. This week had some of the worst price action we have seen in a bout a year (in my opinion). I wanted to convert the PAs and go into next week fresh after the weekend and start trading my strategy as intended again and with confidence. 

I hope to pass those final two EVALs on Monday if possible so I can convert them to PAs. If I am unsuccessful in doing so then I will be able to pass and convert them after the full 7 days of trading. 

As you guys know I have had countless issues this week with topstep I have detailed a lot of them through my posts but have talked about them in other various issues. I am currently in talks with Topsteps on how to remediate some of these issues. Due to that I did not trade my Topstep accounts Friday. I still have three topstep evals. Depending on when I finally hear back from Topstep and reach a final resolution I will or will not resume trading those evals and attempt to pass them before the 30 days is up (gives me three weeks going slow). 

I look forward to trading next week and having some solid movement return to this market on the backs of this jammed pack week.

Institutions said that driven by AI technology, the consumer electronics industry will start a new cycle, “AI +”, XR (including AR, VR, MR), smart cars and so on will become the main line of investment.

**All enterprises will fully join in the AI competition**

Artificial intelligence(AI) has undoubtedly become the focus of CES 2024’s attention, and major enterprises have demonstrated the deep integration of AI and various fields, leading a new chapter of future technology.

According to Nvidia, the application of AI in entertainment, Internet and media will be explosive in 2024, and generative AI will reshape the future of the mobile mobility and automotive industry.

As a core component of AI technology, AI chips can provide more powerful computing power for artificial intelligence applications. At CES, Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and AMD (AMD) brought chips that support end-side AI, enabling devices to quickly calculate computer vision, voice to text, text or picture generation.

Intel’s new Core Ultra processor platform, which incorporates Intel 4 process and 3D Foveros packaging technology, integrates a new generation of performance and energy efficiency cores, as well as a new Arc GPU graphics card. AMD has released many new processors, such as the Ryzen 8000G desktop APU.

Qualcomm released the third generation Snapdragon 8 platform and Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, designed for generative AI. In addition to the product display, Qualcomm said the latest innovation achievements and cooperation trends in AI, automotive, XR and other fields, and in-depth interpretation from the aspects of industrial empowerment, application scenarios and future development trends.

We will firmly promote the development of AI, enter hundreds of industries, and reshape all industries in society, including the way people live and work. But the future is that the pattern of fragmentation is gradually taking shape, and people’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence continues to be ignited. The coming year of 2024 will be a much more innovative year for both big models and related content around AI.",1706518388,819512,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,4c5ff0362bc00bee77f13e45fa972b24e998e42e50565eefcccdce1afacf63cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1adqur8/the_ai_innovation_storm_has_swept_through_ces/

234,Humanoid robot innovation news: Tesla’s robot Optimus new function–folding clothes," 

On January 16, Musk posted a video of Optimus, a Tesla (TSLA) research robot, folding its shirts on social media.

**Musk shows off the Optimus for folding clothes**

According to the video released by Musk, Optimus is standing at a table, slowly folding a black shirt, seemingly without any external help. But all of these are highly scripted and pre-programmed activities, and are more than that designed to demonstrate the impressive features of the robot’s joints, servers, and limbs.

In fact, in Tesla’s demo of a new Optimus Gen 2 prototype video released last month, the Optimus second-generation robot has been significantly improved in every way compared to its predecessor.

Tesla said the Optimus Gen 2 will first be used in its manufacturing plants, and the company will start selling the robot once its utility is proven. Musk added that Optimus is heavily underestimated, that demand could reach 10 billion to 20 billion units and “confidently predicts” that Optimus will account for the majority of Tesla’s long-term value.

&#x200B;

* The Company increased its positive free cash flow run rate from $4.1  million in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 to $5.7 million in the  fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, representing a sequential increase of 40%
* Current annual revenue run rate is approaching $510 million,  maintaining High Tide’s position as Canada’s top revenue-generating  cannabis company**¹**
* The Company celebrated its 15th consecutive quarter and its 5th straight quarter of record**²** positive adjusted EBITDA**³** 
* Same-store sales increased 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially
* The Company maintains its position as the largest non-franchised  cannabis retailer in Canada, with 163 current locations and 4.9 million  total customers across Canada, the United States and Europe
* Cabana Club membership grew to over 1.28 million members as of  today, representing an increase of 35% year-over-year and 16% since  September 14, 2023
* The Company grew its Cabana ELITE paid membership program at its  fastest pace since inception to over 28,000 members as of today,  representing an increase of 367% year-over-year and 49% since September  14, 2023
* During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, Canna Cabana held over 19%  of the cannabis retail market share in Alberta and 9% in Ontario.  Across the five provinces in which the Company has a presence, Canna  Cabana represented 10% of the market share in dollars while only  representing approximately 4.6% of the total cannabis retail store count  in those provinces

&#x200B;

“Once  again, the High Tide team has demonstrated that it is amongst the best  in the business by delivering a second consecutive quarter of record  free cash flow, clocking in at $5.7 million for the fourth quarter,  representing an increase of 40% from the third quarter. This places us  amongst an elite group of publicly traded cannabis companies anywhere to  consistently generate meaningful amounts of free cash flow while  continuing to grow our business. Our operational prowess is starting to  get noticed by the capital markets, as witnessed by the fact that High  Tide closed 2023 as Canada’s top-performing cannabis stock, even  outperforming several ETFs and MSOs. We did this all while  simultaneously reducing our debt to a very manageable debt to 2023  Adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.9, while adding 13 stores and breaking  revenue records since inception and Adjusted EBITDA records for five  straight quarters,” said Raj Grover, Founder and Chief Executive Officer  of High Tide.

“Looking  ahead, we see ample opportunities to build on our success in the  Canadian market, where our Cabana Club membership is showing no signs of  slowing down and now stands at over 1.28 million Cabana Club members.  ELITE, our paid membership tier, grew at its fastest pace since  inception, up 9,200 members versus September 14, 2023, and has now  surpassed 28,000 members. Ontario’s recent decision to double its  provincial retail cannabis store cap to 150 is a game changer for High  Tide as we hope to meaningfully increase revenues over the next several  years and now adjust our long-term growth target to 300  bricks-and-mortar stores in Canada, further solidifying our position as  the country’s largest non-franchised cannabis retailer.

“While  we remain focused on our core Canadian business, like any  forward-thinking company, we are always looking at what opportunities  may exist to expand our Canna Cabana brand internationally. We are  seeing momentum regarding cannabis rescheduling in the United States,  which could potentially pave a path for major U.S. exchanges to allow  listed companies to engage in plant-touching business. We are also  keenly following developments in Europe, particularly Germany, where  adult use pilot projects focused on specialty cannabis shops could be  possible in 2025. These global opportunities, combined with an improved  regulatory environment across many Canadian provinces, gives me  confidence that 2024 will be yet another stellar year for High Tide as  we work towards our ambition of building a top-tier global adult-use  cannabis brand,” added Mr. Grover.

Today was the first time in weeks that we have seen the bears have any sort of strength (at least on NQ). For the most part today ES/Spy just sat and chopped in a very tight range… up and until power hour ES had only moved a total of 16.5 points and SPY has only moved a total of $1.37. This makes for easily one of the smallest overall ranges that ES/Spy have moved inside intraday in a very long time. I think the only time it had a smaller range was when the markets had half days.

MSFT initially had a nice green reaction but is now down about 1% after hours.

We have some heavy hitting data the next three days with some very important pre-market data tomorrow. 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f70ibdxrgnfc1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=39002e16ab462d26700e400bc7cc6bcf030c4061

Of the last 9 FOMCs we have opened green 5 out of 9 times with an average move up of 0.16% overnight. We have also closed green 5 out of 9 times with an average close of 0.73%+.  However I don’t know the last time we have had three major earnings and data the night into FOMC. 

This FOMC is an interesting one in my opinion and here is why. I honestly do not think this FOMC matters in the grand scheme of things. Why? Its simple… markets 100% expect a continuation in pause of rates at this meeting. There is nothing to really surprise markets here with rates. We also do not get DOT Plot (arguably the most important thing that comes from FOMC) until March. Meaning while JPOW can say whatever he wants about the rate cuts and forward guidance until the markets see a change in the dot plot (at march meeting) it really doesn’t matter. We did have a spike in CPI last meeting, which I do expect JPOW to emphasize is concerning for them. However, it really does not matter because we get two more readings of CPI before the March meeting. 

Almost every event for the last 4 months markets have said “this is the event that finally sends us down.” Yet the market has just continued to rally every single time and chooses to not care about pretty much anything. I still find it completely unwise to bet against the bulls in the grand scheme of things. 

This feels a lot like I believe it was October 2023 where we had a similar move in CPI, FOMC and Earnings all around the same week to two week time frame. “IT set up the perfect bearish scenario” yet the markets chose to completely ignore it all and rally. I do think the same setup presents here… however I would wait for it to actually turn bearish before I short this market. 

If the markets are bloody (think -1% at least) at close tomorrow there is a sizeable chance we see downside continuation. However, until we realistically get a move like that and more importantly as stated before close under the daily 20ema I think markets will continue to ignore all data and continue to pump to the upside. 

As a friendly warning for anyone that has not traded FOMC Day… 2pm will be a big move… it will be violent. Tread lightly… 230pm is historically when we see the reversal… 

**SPY DAILY**

We continue to see daily extreme bull momentum on SPY and we continue to push to hold supports. There is an incredibly impressive red rising wedge formed here now too.

Bears have an opportunity to drop us to 487.36 support tomorrow (< 1% drop). That should be their ultimate target with a bigger target of 485.38.

Bulls will target an almost 2% green day tomorrow to hit the big $500 that everyone has been talking about.

 Supply- 487.98

ES remains in extreme daily bull momentum like SPY, however, it did not see daily buyers come in to support this upside move here. Now unlike SPY we actually are seeing a new daily supply at 4951. This is mostly due to the after hours drop related to earnings. 

Bulls will make a push for 5000 tomorrow which is about a 1% push up.

Bears will make a push for 4913 which is about a 1% drop and then 4900 which is just under 1.5% drop.

On QQQ unlike SPY/ ES we got a new daily supply today at 428.26. We also did not see buyers support the upside move. The QQQ daily has really built out a nice 5 day long 423.71-428.26 range. 

Tomorrow I am targeting a +/- $5 or about 1% move on QQQ to target either under $420 or over $430.

QQQ and NQ continue to (Especially today) look far heavier than ES/Spy… We have a really nice 17506-177697 range built out over the last almost 6 days. We came down here after hours directly to that 17506 support area but haven’t quite closed under it. 

There is quite the impressive red rising wedge formed here too which broke after hours on the earnings announcements. 

Much like QQQ I am looking for about a 1% +/- move on NQ or about 200 points… targets are a closure under 17300 for bears or over 17700 for bulls. A bigger 300pt move takes us to 17800 or under daily 20ema support near 17200. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS

I expect the 10yr to have a huge amount of movement overnight and into tomorrow with earnings and everything else happening. 

The 10YR has been in an upward bull channel for the last month and a half now and as of today it officially wicked through that support. It also is back under the daily 20ema support for the first time since 1/12/24 and took out supply at 4.042% which was our target. 

Bears need to see a major bounce here on the 10yr to close back over 8/20ema resistance of 4.104%.

Bulls would like to see this downside move on the 10yr continue and will ideally target a bigger drop to the 3.906-3.948% double demand area (over the next week or so). 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS

DXY is dangerously close to losing the same 1.5 month long bull channel that the 10YR lost today. 

We also got a new supply at 103.451. Much like ES/ NQ we remain in a about 30 cent chop range here (at close) on DXY for the last 12 days… 

Bulls need to see a huge drop in DXY tomorrow under 103.246 but ideally under the 20ema support of 103.069.

Bears will look to bard bounce the EMA supports to close over 103.541 but ideally close over 103.8.

250,Dubai metaverse strategy: Aiming to become one of the world’s top metaverse economies by 2030," 

In December, the South Korean government stepped up its support for virtual worlds and launched a $48.3 million fund to develop and support acquisitions of various startups to help advance the meta-universe ecosystem. Dubai has launched a metaverse strategy that aims to become one of the world’s top ten metaverse economies by 2030 and become the center of the global yuan universe community, actively attracting startups.

  
In fact, as an integrated innovation and fusion application integrating the Internet, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality and other technologies, the metaverse is the future industry with high hopes. Many industry experts in the industry point out that the metaverse still has a large potential, but its definition and application have changed during this period, especially in the enterprise field —— the future lies not in the exclusive digital utopia, but in the seamless integration with the physical world.

There are also new advances on the hardware side. XR and other hardware devices are considered to be an important entrance to the metaverse. Recently, recently, with the help of apple (AAPL) Vision Pro, it seems to be the next key point for the whole industry. Moreover, when it comes to the metaverse, Meta (META) must be an inescapable enterprise. Even when Meta has lost $50 billion, Zuckerberg has not given up on his investment, and that will continue for some time to come.

Obviously, Zuckerberg’s continuous investment in the metaverse not only lets the public see his continued optimism about the metaverse but also shows the development of the universe, which has entered a new development cycle. More and more signs are emerging that the metaverse is coming to the public in its own way.

256,"FOMC Day Review… 1-31-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Lots to unpack here… As mentioned last night we had a very lackluster earnings of three of the major holdings for big tech. We are set to get more earnings reports tomorrow after hours. This earning troubles has now set a new tone for the markets in my opinion. Take a look at MSFT they had a really nice beat across the board… but things were priced to such perfection that they missed. 

Lets take a look at everything that was said at FOMC and what the markets are now pricing in for 2024. 

Note- FOMC statements taken from various twitter feeds. 

· US Interest Rate Decision Actual 5.5% (Forecast 5.5%, Previous 5.5%)

· The Fed judges risks to achieving employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.

· The Fed does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce rates until there is greater confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.

· Fed: Job gains have moderated but remain strong, unemployment remains low, and inflation has eased, but remains elevated.

· Fed: Recent data suggest economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.

· Fed: The economic outlook is uncertain, the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.

· US Short-term interest-rate futures pare earlier gains after the FOMC statement.

· Fed: Recent data suggest economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. 

· Fed: Bond holding reductions will continue as described previously.

· The Fed unanimously reaffirms its statement on longer-run goals and the monetary policy strategy adopted in August 2020.

· Fed's Powell: The economy has made good progress, inflation has eased.

· Fed's Powell: The labor market remains tight.

· Fed's Powell: Labor demand still exceeds supply.

· Fed's Powell: Our policy rate is likely at its peak

· Fed's Powell: It will likely be appropriate to begin reducing rates sometime this year.

· Fed's Powell: If the economy evolves as expected, we will dial back the policy rate this year.

· Fed's Powell: Ongoing progress on inflation is not assured.

· Fed's Powell: Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could reverse inflation progress.

· Fed's Powell: At same time, reducing the policy rate too late could unduly weaken the economy.

· Fed's Powell: The timing of cuts is linked to our confidence.

· Fed's Powell: I would not say we have achieved a soft landing yet. We have a ways to go to achieve soft landing. We are not declaring victory.

· Fed's Powell: I am more concerned that inflation will stabilize at an elevated level.

· Fed's Powell: We are not looking for inflation to tap 2% once, we are looking for it to settle out at 2%.

The bear case that I was not expecting is actually playing out. After Decembers FOMC the market basically called the feds bluff and priced in far more dovishness and far more rate cuts than JPOW ever alluded to. With the spike in Inflation for January and now JPOW essentially saying the same thing that we are not going to see rate cuts any time soon… we are finally seeing this market come back to reality. The question now is how will markets digest this over night. There is certainly the perfect bearish correction scenario formed here with earnings and now FOMC.

My downside target today was 487.36 with the ultimate target being 485.38. With a closure under these levels we are now underneath the daily 8ema support. This also breaks us down through that major red rising wedge I mentioned yesterday. 

Downside target wise we will have major support at the daily 20ema support near 480.91 which will also be where our daily yellow bull channel support sits. If the bears close under 480.91 tomorrow we could be starting the major correction many have been waiting for. Next major downside target is the daily double supply near 478.88-479.12.

Bulls are going to need a pretty major bounce tomorrow and will look to recover back over daily 8ema resistance near 486 in order to regain control.

My downside target for today was 4900 and we completely blew through that and actually are nearing the daily 20ema support of 4854. The daily yellow bull channels support sits at 4875 for tomorrow. Meaning that unless the bulls heavily buy this up overnight and prevent any further downside we likely are looking a move back to the daily 20ema support of 4853 and then potentially the bigger downside target of 4813-4836. 

Bulls need to retake the 4900 area of the daily 8ema resistance in order to be back in control.

We officially have daily sellers on QQQ for the first time since 1/8/24. My target for today on QQQ was 420 which we blew through and we are now sitting at daily 20ema support of 416.2. This is a major bounce or die spot here for QQQ.

Bears will look to use daily sellers to drop us under the daily 20ema support of 416.2 and target the bigger breakdown to the double supply area of 409.58-411.52. 

Bulls need to hard bounce this 20ema support and minimally retake 421.85 daily 8ema resistance in order to be back in control. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 409.58 -> 411.52 -> 428.26

We did not quite get daily sellers on NQ but we likely will see them come into the market tomorrow. We also are sitting on daily 20ema support here of 17250. The targets for today was 17300 and 17200. WE did not quite get to 17200 but we were able to hit that 17300 area nicely. 

Bears are looking to take us through 20ema support and target the bigger retrace to double supply support near 16981-17133.

Bulls will need to recover back over daily 8ema resistance of 17427 in order to be back in control. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS

A little surprisingly today we actually have a major drop on the 10yr yield. However, I mostly equate this to the fact that we got the QRA statement from the fed at 830am.

The 10yr had a really nice hard bounce off previous demand/ support of 3.948% and clearly has broken its uptrend.

Bulls need to see 3.906% demand/ support break in order to attempt to bounce this market. 

Bears will look to use this double demand are for a major bounce back to the 8/20ema resistance near 4.074%.

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.16%  
 Demand- 3.906% -> 3.948%

Now DXY did break through its bull channel support but as you can see by EOD (due to FOMC) it was able to get a massive bounce and put in a new demand/ support at 103.367 and recover all the way back over key resistance of 103.541. 

With this breakout here we should look for DXY to continue to the 104.083 double supply which would fit the narrative of a much bigger correction coming on markets. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.083

VIX gets a notable mention today as it finally had a day of correlation and finally held its closure into EOD. 

We broke through 13.98 supply and now it appears that we will be headed back to that 14.86-15.31 triple supply area that we wicked off of a few days ago (on a phantom print). 

This breakout here if the VIX closes over 15.31 would signal a much larger correction coming in the markets. However, if the VIX rejects here and pushes back down into the 13s we likely are going to get a short retrace and break back out to ATHs on the market.

257,Don't forget about Nickel!! Car batteries (lithium ion batteries) actually have more nickel than lithium in them,"With the adoption of electric vehicles in North America and Europe, there is no doubt that the United States will need a secure domestic source for nickel and other battery metals. Alaska is currently that exploration destination in the US, and Alaska Energy Metals, OTCQB: $AKEMF, is focused on meeting the growing nickel demand in our current economy. Definity a company to look out for in 2024! Nickel is not only used in car batteries but has other uses as well:

* Stainless Steel Production: Enhances corrosion resistance and strength in stainless steel.
* Alloying Agent: Used in various alloy compositions like cupronickel, Inconel, and Invar.
* Electrical and Electronics: Used in connectors, plating, and electronic components.
* Aerospace and Aircraft: Vital for aircraft engines and components due to its properties.
* Chemical Industry: Used in equipment where corrosion resistance is crucial.
* Medical Equipment: Used in dental appliances and orthodontic braces.
* Plating: Used for electroplating to provide corrosion-resistant coatings.

Alaska Energy Metals’ Nikolai project represents a promising opportunity as a substantial and dependable domestic source of nickel in support of the ongoing transition to cleaner energy. With a foundation of historical drilling data, there are compelling indications pointing to the presence of a significant nickel deposit, as well as the discovery of other valuable metals.

As progress continues with the initial drilling program, which is slated for completion by the fall of 2023, the primary objective is to establish an initial Inferred Resource estimate. Should the findings confirm the historical data, there is an anticipation that the resource could exceed a remarkable **one billion pounds of nickel** content. The aspiration is to reach this significant milestone by the spring of 2024

267,NxGen Brands Inc. Sets Date for 'Mad Scoops Anabolic Protein' Product Launch & Announces Product to Include Innovative 'Inclusions',"NxGen Brands, Inc. (OTC Pink: NXGB) (""NxGen"" or the ""Company"") ([www.nxgenbrands.com](https://www.nxgenbrands.com)) announces it is setting the product launch date for its exciting new ""Mad Scoops Anabolic Protein"", available in four flavors, as March 15th 2024 from its Mad House Supps range ([www.madhousesupps.com](https://www.madhousesupps.com)).

&#x200B;

According to Fortune Business Insights™, the US protein supplement market was valued at $8.2bn in 2022 and is forecast to grow to $16.4bn by 2029. Mad House's new Protein will be fortified with 3 sources of ultra-premium protein, plus digeseb™ which is an innovate 'NO-BLOAT' protein absorption ingredient, making the customers' use experience of this product significantly better than other comparable products, the Company believes, making it a truly unique product that is well placed to attract consumers in this market space to the brand.

&#x200B;

Coming in four flavors, ""Milk & Cookies"", ""Frosted Sugar Cookie"", ""Peanut Butter Brookie"" and ""State Fair Churros"", the product will also have what the industry calls 'inclusions'. These are real pieces of churro, cookie, brookie and cookie and not just flavoring, making yet another unique selling point for the product.

&#x200B;

Speaking about the new protein product, CEO Joseph Lawanson had this to say: ""'The Perfect Protein Does Exist…until now' is our motto for our new Mad House Scoops protein. It will contain 23g of protein with 11g of amino acids to make this the perfect protein blend. Each scoop of 'Mad House Scoops™' contains the core building blocks necessary to create a true 'Circus Freak' physique. I cannot wait for people to be able to get hold of this product from the NxGen Brands family of products.""

&#x200B;

In a January 16th 2024 release from the Company, they stated that their belief is that the protein, along with the Storm Lifestyles 'Shrooms' ([www.stormlifestyles.com](https://www.stormlifestyles.com)), will deliver an additional $1.2m in topline revenue to the company in the subsequent twelve months following launch.

This is now the fourth time we have seen bears have an opportunity to drop this lower and they completely failed…

We had similar huge red days on November 9th, December 6th and December 20th. All three of these days ended up being reloading zones for bulls and led to massive breakouts. 

November 9th= 5.9% rise over 20days  
 December 6th= 4.86% over 11 days  
 December 20th= 4.9% over 33 days

We could easily be looking at a 4.9% breakout (from yesterdays low) over the next about 20 days. This would put SPY at about $506-$507 by February 20th.

No surprise here but markets have completely pulled back on their “wild” rate cut expectations that started at the December FOMC meeting. As of right now we are seeing the higher odds (89%) that we get our first rate cut in May. IF you remember that just a month ago markets though out first rate cut would come in March and even for a while had sizeable odds of a January rate cut (the meeting we just had).

The bears once again had the worlds most perfect technical and news driven opportunity to drop the market and we once again chose to bounce instead of sell off.

We put in a new daily demand at 482.88 and we did see new buyers show up today. This should (outside of a major reaction to the downside like Tuesday night from earnings) be our bottom. I fully expect markets to make a run for 490.84 tomorrow. 

Bulls need to see daily buyers come back in and close back over 490.84 supply to have a major breakout next week with the ultimate target being $500.

Bears need to see a nasty double top and close back under the daily 8ema support of 486.32 in order to be back in control.

 Supply- 490.84

Much like SPY we had a hard bounce and a new daily demand put in at 4871. However, we actually saw new daily buyers return to the chart today. This along with essentially bouncing off daily 20ema support and retaking the daily 8ema resistance should open an opportunity for bulls to run this back to 4950. I mentioned yesterday that unless the bulls completely bought the dip and didn’t see any downside that we would break through the yellow bull channel… the bulls of course perfectly bounced us off the channel support today to keep the multi month long channel intact. 

Bulls need to close over 4950 to break this range and target a much larger breakout to 5000 into next week. 

Bears will need a hard rejection at this 4925 area to then take us back under the daily 8ema support and target the breakdown of this yellow bull channel support.

QQQ also put in a new daily demand at 416.96 and had a really nice bounce off its daily 20ema support area. We also saw the daily sellers that came in yesterday officially weaken today. 

Bulls are now fighting at the daily 8ema resistance area and will look to turn that into support tomorrow. Bulls new target is the 423.71 demand to take that out and eventually push to the 428.71 supply area. There is a fairly sizeable bull flag that has now formed here too. 

Bears will need to get price back under the daily 8ema resistance and close back under the 416.96 support area if they want to be back in control. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 428.17  
 Demand- 416.96 -> 423.71

Much like ES we saw daily buyers return to NQ today and we of course like the others got a new daily demand at 17264.

With this hard bounce off daily 20ema support and the massive pop after hours we took out 17506 demand. 

Bulls need to target and eventually push back to 17701 supply area. 

Bears will attempt to close back under daily 8ema tomorrow and eventually need to close us under the daily demand of 17264 to be back in control. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17701  
 Demand- 17264 -> 17506

The 10 year did not find any support at the double demand are of 3.906-3.948% and instead is making its way back to the quad demand/ support area of 3.701% to 3.787%. 

This is a very important support area on the 10yr. 3.787% is where we had our bottom put in on 12/27/23. 3.701-3.742% area is the support area from June 2023. 

Bulls are going to look to continue this sell off down into that quad demand area. 

Bears quickly need to find a hard bounce here and will look to push back over 3.906-3.948%. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.16%  
 Demand- 3.701% -> 3.709% -> 3.742% -> 3.787% -> 3.906% -> 3.948%

Despite the bounce on the dollar yesterday we saw a really nice hard rejection to put in a new daily supply at 103.541. With this rejection we also closed below the major support area of 103.246-103.38 and under all the EMAs. 

With the 10yr and DXY both rejecting their upside pushes this certainly gives markets an opportunity to go on a major bounce tomorrow and into next week. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 102.447 -> 103.541  
 Demand- 102.32 -> 103.246 -> 103.38

After what looked like a potential major breakout here on the VIX yesterday, we are now left with yet again another failed breakout and yet again another supply/ resistance level at 14.36.

This 14.36-15.31 area is certainly a major resistance area to watch. 

One interesting trend I am noting here on the VIX is that since the mid December low on the VIX we have steadily been making lower lows on double bottoms. Interestingly enough over the last almost two months the VIX has not closed a new 52 week low nor has it been able to close below that 12.44 demand level. 

The VIX, despite markets being at ATHs, is actually slowly but surely in an uptrend here. It has not closed a lower low in almost two months while it has closed multiple higher highs.

272,"News for Abitibi Metals Corp. (CSE:AMQ) Today: Unveiling a Transformative Year and a Promising Future in the Mining Industry (Copper, Gold & More)","Today, Abitibi Metals Corp. (Ticker: AMQ.c or AMQFF for US investors) highlighted its key achievements from 2023 and shared its outlook for 2024.

Going public in 2020, AMQ focused on responsible acquisitions, aiming to unlock shareholder value. Last year, a pivotal decision led to a rebrand, solidifying AMQ's commitment to becoming a significant player in the mineral-rich Abitibi Greenstone Belt.

A standout accomplishment in 2023 was securing the option to earn 80% of the B26 Polymetallic Copper Deposit, a high-grade discovery in Quebec. 

AMQ also successfully executed its financing goals, raising over $14 million, with strategic investors like Billionaire Frank Giustra and Greg Chamandy coming on board. This funding accelerates the development of the B26 Deposit.

With a 2024 exploration budget of $10 million, AMQ is currently focused on drilling approximately 30,000 meters at the B26 Polymetallic Copper Deposit. Initial results are expected by the end of February. Additionally, a comprehensive review of historical geophysics and the ongoing development of a 3D model will support exploration goals.

The Beschefer Gold Project, located just 7 km from the B26 Deposit, will see about 3,000 meters of drilling in Q1, with AMQ aiming to complete the option agreement and secure 100% ownership. 

https://preview.redd.it/0f3k93j442gc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b324ca6654da4c1dfd9195b8d1eea2204a4c83

Looking forward, AMQ aims to capitalize on high-quality assets, strategically positioning itself to address anticipated shortages in essential elements like copper and silver. 

The company has completed OTCQB and DTC applications, enhancing its marketing and awareness initiatives. To amplify its presence, AMQ will attend the PDAC conference in March, exploring opportunities for increased visibility throughout the year.

Jonathon Deluce, CEO of Abitibi Metals, expressed enthusiasm for 2024, highlighting the company's financial strength and the significance of securing the high-grade B26 Polymetallic Copper Deposit. With a clear strategic vision, AMQ looks poised for continued success in Quebec's mineral-rich greenstone belt.

283,"This is the Bull Market Everyone’s Been Waiting For… 2/2/24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis"," 

Since 2022 when we started our bear markets everyone has been saying they cant wait for the next bull market like 2020-2021… what many hasn’t realized is that we have been in that bull market for almost a year and a half now. Essentially since we put in our October 2022 lows and started to rally we have been in a bull trend. Every pullback is ate up like it never happened. Honestly since October of 2023 this has probably been one of the most extreme buyings of the dip that I have ever seen. I wont even say its that this market is “resilient” its pure based on the fact that this market does not want to do anything but go up. I have been saying it really for months now but there is absolutely no reason to short this market at all.

I am not even saying that technicals don’t matter because they certainly do but the overwhelming move is bullish and realistically until we get some sort of wild 3 to 4 days of back to back selling and lose some major supports there is no reason to be bearish at all.

I think there will come a day of reconning in this market… but its not today and likely not any time soon. IF the first rate cut is truly being pushed back to Summer we could have a few more months of pumping… To put something into perspective with ES at $5000 today a 20% crash (a new bear market) would put ES at exactly $4000… That would be only dropping to March 2023 support area. To revisit the lows from the 2022 bear market we would need over a 43% drop on the markets.

Looking at next weeks agenda we don’t really have too much to worry about unlike this week. There is a notable 60 minutes interview with JPOW (pre recorded) Sunday night at 7pm. Monday we have PMI and then realistically the only things I forsee actually moving markets data wise this week is the 10yr bond auction on Wednesday and then the 30yr bond auction on Thursday.

**SPY WEEKLY**

We also had buyers come back in and continue to justify this weekly run up. This is a really nice bounce off the weekly 8ema support with a long wick breakout candle. I would expect much like the week of 1/15/24 to 1/22/24 expect a breakout next week.

Yellow bull channel resistance sits at 506 for next week and should be our target.

I would not look to short this market realistically until we can close back under 467.96 demand/ weekly 20ema support.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 475.46  
Demand- 467.96

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

Much like SPY we had a really nice support bounce and breakout candle off the weekly 8ema support area. Bulls are going to look to move into the 5100 resistance area which is also the resistance of the weekly yellow bull channel. Weekly buyers continue to look strong and continue to justify these new highs.

From a weekly standpoint I see little reason to short this market until we close back under 4733 demand and weekly 20ema support.

Last week on QQQ we had closed out an imbalanced weekly candle as we put in a new supply but closed over it. We put in a new weekly demand at 423.1 and now have officially rebalanced the weekly.

With new weekly buyers, a new weekly demand and continuation of extreme weekly momentum I expect bulls to continue to breakout next week after backtesting and holding weekly 8ema support this week.

The yellow bull channel resistance sits near 441 and the red resistance sits near 445 for next week.

Bears have little reason to short this market until it closes back under at least 396.72 demand and 20ema support (or at least breaks weekly yellow bull channel support).

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS

Weekly NQ also rebalanced itself this week and in an even more bullish aspect turned previous supply into demand at 17460. This 17460 level should be rocksolid support. This is bulls first defense on any sort of drop. However, I would again not recommend being short until we closed at least under 16455 demand and weekly 20ema support.

The weekly yellow bull channel resistance sits at 18191 and red sits at 18388 as potential breakout targets.

Now the 10yr I will say surprised me today. Earlier this week and even with FOMC the 10yr was on a pretty impressive sell off. However, today the 10yr had one of its strongest and biggest upside moves since summer of 2023 and for a while was the bigger moves since fall 2022.

I am fairly surprised to see the 10yr get such an incredible pop intraday but see markets close out so strongly.

The 10yr came backdown and hard bounced and wicked off previous 3.867% demand.

We also added a new weekly supply at 4.161%.

This massive doji is a pretty strong reversal candle here and very well could lead to a move back to 4.161-4.244% area next week and into EOM.

There was some correlation between bonds/ dxy and markets but even that correlation has completely fallen apart.

US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 4.161% -> 4.244%  
Demand- 3.867% -> 4.225%

Now this could still turn into a massive bear flag here on DXY but we are also working on a potential V bottom breakout here.

Much like with the 10yr there was a very solid correlation between it and markets but that correlation is becoming less and less relevant.

After back to back weeks of rejecting the weekly 20/50ema resistance near 103.522 we are finally seeing the weekly breakout on DXY.

The last resistance level is 104.009 before we likely see a much bigger breakout to 105.591 supply area.

Much like the 10yr today I am fairly surprised to see a big green day on DXY and a massively big green day on ES/ NQ.

DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 104.009 -> 105.591

After having a massive pop to the upside last week and having weekly buyers return to the markets for the first time since October 2023 we are finally seeing sellers return here. Oil has been on a huge rollerocaster this week (mostly due to all the geo-political news).

With this massive rejection off the weekly 50ema and a new supply at 78.38 we are officially right back at the 69.81-71.22 triple demand/ support area. Our yellow weekly bull channel is still intact here and if OIL gets a major bounce early next week we will look to push to the upside and potentially put in a new weekly demand.

However, oil has been in this same about $2 area for the last 2-3 months so it is fairly likely that we just consolidate here again.

CL/ OIL FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 78.38  
Demand- 69.81 -> 71.12 -> 71.22

**VIX DAILY**

The most notable thing continues to be the fact that the VIX daily is in an uptrend for the last two months (relatively) while markets are also clearly in a major uptrend.

We from a technical perspective are starting to lose all correlations that used to be there in the markets. I am surprised to see a weekly uptrend on DXY, US 10YR YIELD and the VIX for the last month all while ES/ NQ continue to push new ATHS with out a single pullback.

This feels like one of those moments in history where we get the massive blow off top and see some sort of dot com bubble like burst. Even historically speaking its healthy to backtest the daily 50ema support while in a real bull market. The fact that we can barely even get to the daily 20ema support before we have the worlds biggest squeeze is just not sustainable long term. However, as I have been saying for weeks now there Is just no reason to be bearish long term. Even intraday it rarely pays lately to be a bear.",1706908702,819724,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,dc51e0275780a7f4768276a7b5a9246d9e8a215e4271131fe214fc1962472b9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ahejv0/this_is_the_bull_market_everyones_been_waiting/

290,"Vision Pro leads an AR trend, Meta/WiMi started their strategic layout in AR market"," 

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Meta (META) is hoping that the launch of Vision Pro will help it boost the company’s XR headset business.

Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, were optimistic about the launch of Vision Pro, saying Apple’s push into the headset market would “test the possibilities of their existing business and attract more consumers” said, citing people familiar with the matter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dix4d8iiaqgc1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=58d6e88712f9423f44fab4fb93c17c0e56290a65

Apple (AAPL) has moved the move from virtual reality to mixed reality. With the Vision Pro released in the U. S., Meta employees believe that Quest and its software ecosystem will be Apple’s main rival in the metauniverse and a role similar to Google Android in the smartphone space.

Apple’s entry into the headset space marks the latest chapter in Apple’s competition with Meta. Meta executives and industry insiders believe the future battle will focus on software as it will play a huge role in developing apps that will attract more users.

**New AR interaction function**

In addition, Reality Labs researchers in Meta’s XR division recently demonstrated a way to interact with the real world through augmented reality (AR). This research can not only digitize the real objects in the real world but also can seamlessly erase the corresponding real objects after generating the virtual objects.

Reality Labs The researchers called the concept “scene responsiveness,” claiming that the approach created a “visual illusion of virtual action affecting physical scenes,” and presented their results at the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Workshop late last year.

**AR growth potential in the XR market**

Apple’s Vision Pro began pre-orders on January 19, and pre-sale data for the first weekend showed initial strong demand. It is worth mentioning that before the Vision Pro launch, the global XR industry had experienced more than ten years of development, but due to the lack of high-quality content, the development of the industry encountered a bottleneck.

Now, for the development trend of the market, Apple set off a heat wave, directly driving many big factories in the XR industry are reform. Counterpoint Research Analysis, ” Although the launch of Apple Vision Pro will not immediately change the entire industry pattern, it will undoubtedly take an important step forward and will guide the future development direction of the XR industry.

**WiMi builds the AR ecosystem**

It has to be said that XR has once again become the focus of the tech industry this year, and over the past few years, everyone has been waiting for the “iPhone moment” of XR. With Apple officially entering the game, expect to be taken to a very high point. In particular, Apple’s first Vision Pro sales, hot sales are very good, to the XR industry impact is very obvious.

According to the data, the first WiMi Hologram Cloud(NASDAQ: WIMI), actively build an AR ecosystem, with the AR industry as the base, accelerate the further development of industrial ecology, and will work with industry partners to build the development of XR industry. According to the introduction, WiMi Hologram Cloud has a special platform for AR to carry out product development and commercialization promotion and has successively realized the research and development of several AR and VR products.

At the same time, in hardware manufacturing, software development, content production and channel distribution, WiMi Hologram Cloud layout is also earlier. In terms of software, it has considerable technical strength and scale effect. In terms of content development, it applies to nearly 5,000 IP projects and is actively mature in advertising, games, video production and other aspects.

In addition, WiMi Hologram Cloud sends a signal to the outside world that XR will develop faster, and pay more attention to application, ecological landing and other aspects. An obvious signal is that WiMi Hologram Cloud will plan to build including metaverse scenic area, yuan museum, metaverse exhibition hall, yuan universe wisdom classroom, XR industrial roaming, XR vocational training, XR wisdom cities such as multiple scenarios, covering Wenbo, consumption, industry, education and other digital industry, further explore XR human-computer interaction ability and scene, help users realize experience jumped.

**To sum up**

After a decade of silence, XR finally ushered in a chance to “turn over”, Apple’s decade of grinding a sword of Vision Pro officially entered the public, and the concept of XR is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Just as the iPhone and App Store opened the entire generations of mobile Internet, XR has the potential to disrupt will be the entire industry.

Of course, Meta and international technology giants such as Meta and Apple have earlier layout of XR application ecology and have formed a certain user scale and brand influence. However, Chinese enterprises are lacking in this aspect, which can further learn from and be compatible, bring smooth use experience to users, and open a new way of life while liberating their hands.",1707122149,819879,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,e0665fb2da8c3db605a18974cb6b3304883799ebc224e5dc9acfd8c4805afeef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ajbvdk/vision_pro_leads_an_ar_trend_metawimi_started/

If you didn’t get to tune in last night at 7pm JPOW was featured on “60 minutes.” Below is a recap of what he said during that time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/immzds112ugc1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=56820587c57d701309d74f31fe89cf1c66e090b7

Honestly it was a pretty big nothing burger as usual. Markets were post-interview (which was recorded on Thursday) weak/ bearish though. 

Only thing really worth noting from the interview (I did watch it) was that JPOW said first rate cut likely comes mid year (so probably after May meeting). He also said our debt is out of control and on an unstainable path for America. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8hmi8ni12ugc1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed4ea634812a58dfd28a8d36a7aea593658462fd

30 year mortgage rates also hit the highest level since December 12th. This is not going to be well for the housing market. 

I have through this rally spoke about the oddities (especially last week) that are starting to occur… today another major phenomenon and oddity is the fact that China CSI limited down this morning. This is Chinas equivalent to our Russel/ Small Caps… which I have a few times mentioned the fact that Small Caps still have not rallied and still have not come back to join this rally continues to be a once in a life time phenomenon in and of itself. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6oro2x022ugc1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfeed0b30ea5fb93cc202aae50140e6454963071

On Friday I mentioned that there was a big divergence in the fact that the breadths all being negative yet market pushed heavily into the green. For those of you not familiar with Market Breadth it is, a set of technical indicators that evaluate the price advancement and decline of a given stock index. Market breadth represents the total number of stocks that are increasing in prices as opposed to the number of stocks that are undergoing a decline in their prices. This actually was the biggest disparity between markets price action and markets breadth since 1962. Today (while market were red) we are seeing a huge divergence again in the fact that markets were able to completely recover its whole opening hour lost all while the market breadths held very negative. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yl8o2ve22ugc1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d73e28efb5c7472716c38808f11f805c0f0d68f

For most of the day if not all of it today we saw all the top tickers of NQ red besides Apple, Google and NVDA. Yet NQ was able to push green momentarily before power hour. This is just another great example of this market making no sense. 

As you can see above as of power hour today the breadths were all negative and NYSE breadths were almost twice as negative as ES/ NQ… more reason to go why did markets even recover green at one point on NQ? 

I often talk about the US 10YR yield, and this is also starting to diverge here majorly. For example to show how wildly diverged we are… from low on Thursday to todays high the US 10YR has pumped 9.43%. The only other recent move that was close to this was October 17th to 19th where the 10Yr moved up about 6.5%... during that time SPY fell almost 4.7% over 4 days. The closest time that the 10YR had a similar move was March 14th to March 22nd. During that time SPY fell almost 2% but had just dropped 6.6% the week before that (this was during the Bank runs of March 2023). In comparison, this is the biggest move up on the US10YR Yield since the last time markets had a Bank run.

The Dollar from its low on Friday to todays high is up 1.67% in two days. The last time DXY had a move this large was July 27th to 28th. SPY fell 1.6% in two days (from high to low). The only other time was March 14th to 15th that DXY has had a move this large in two days. What happened during that time? That was during the peak of the bank run issues. For reference, SPY dropped 2.5% in two days during this period of time… 

Where is SPY right now? If we take the low of Thursday (the 10YR yield low) and the current price as of writing this we are up just under 2% on SPY over three days… Now correlation is not always causation… but something is severely broken here in these technicals… 

Negative breadth but markets are green. Biggest 2-3 day move up on the US 10YR and DXY since the bank runs of 2023, yet markets are green. Also if you remember last week I referenced that some small regional banks were starting to have issues with NYCB being the leader along with a few names that struggled last time. Could this be our black swan? Or is this market just so far detached from technicals now that it doesn’t matter? 

I want to be clear I am NOT a perma bull (like most) and I am certainly not a perma bull (I have been calling this bull run higher and higher the whole way)… however, I will say that the way the internals of this market are moving feels like the type of market that we wake up on a random Tuesday or Wednesday and SPY is down 2% and there is literal panic in the air. However, I can not emphasize enough until things start making sense again this market truly is likely to just keep going higher and higher and higher till something breaks.

For most of the day today we actually were threatening new supplies on SPY and ES, however, the mid day into EOD recovery negated that. On SPY we actually (surprisingly) did have buyers continue to come in to support further upside here. 

From a price action standpoint this was a really nice back test and bounce off the daily 8ema with a potential hanging man candle to pump us tomorrow. 

Bears had an opportunity but could not take it under the daily 8ema support and could not hold us back under previous supply and range resistance of 490.84. Bears remain out of control until we minimally are under 8ema support but ideally under 20ema support near 484.

Bulls will look to use this daily 8ema bounce and previous resistance that has now become support to push to a new ATHS tomorrow and continue its road to $500.

 Supply- 490.84  
 Demand- 482.88

Now on a slightly different note here while ES had the similar backtest of daily 8ema support and previous resistance we did not have buyers come in to support upside and we did get a new daily supply at 4974.  

With a bounce off the daily 8ema this hammer candle likely this will take a run back at $5000 that the bulls fell 2.25 points short of on Friday. I would not be surprised to see a nice daily double bottom tomorrow. However, 4974 is key resistance right now.

Bulls remain in control and I cant even fathom bears having any sense of control till they minimally close under the daily 20ema support of 4882 area.

QQQ much like SPY did have daily buyers come in to support the upside today. It also had a beautiful bounce off the daily 8ema support and was able to hold over previous range resistance of 428.17. 

With this large and aggressive bounce off the daily 8ema support bulls are going to make another run at ATHs and likely will look to move into the 433-435 area next. 

Bears once again failed to hold it down and will need to close well under the daily 20ema support around 419 to be back in control longer term. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS

 Demand- 416.96

NQ also had buyers come in here to support the upside. However, despite the buyers coming in to support the upside we did not break through and close over 17701. This level has been resistance for almost 12 days now. 

With this hard support bounce here NQ will look to breakout and make a new ATHs which it has not done in almost 9 days. 17800 is the ultimate target for bulls with a bigger target of 17850-17900 next. 

Bears will need to close well under daily 20ema support of 17340 area to be back in control.

Zooming out here to show just how incredibly this move up was on the 10YR yield the last two days. IT took markets 14 days to go from 3.863% area to this 4.16% triple supply area last time. This time we did it in two days. 

We are now back in major resistance area here on the US 10YR of 4.16% to 4.207%. If the 10YR is able to close over 4.207% then its is highly probable we will see a bigger breakout to 4.289% which has not been touched since December 11th 2023 (SPY traded at 470.5 at close that day).

After a massive bounce at 103.026 to put in a new demand on Friday this is an incredible move up on the dollar to blow through our critical double supply/ resistance range (And target for the last 2 weeks) of 104.083-104.165.

We came up and rejected 104.571 demand to take that level out. This is a level that was established back on 9/13/23 and the last time DXY touched this level was 11/17/23 when SPY was trading at 450.79 at close. 

Our next major upside target is 105.086 (last touched on 11/14/23 and established on 11/6/23). Above that we have supply and ultimate resistance/ target of 105.927 from 11/10/23. This if you remember is about a week into the major bull run the markets are currently on. 

It truly is wild to me that these markets are able to even hold green like this while we are seeing the dollar and 10yr pump like it hasn’t done in months (or almost a year).

It has been almost two months since I have only taken one trade during the day. I honestly can say I am beyond happy that I only took one trade today too. I took a great short this morning on the breakdowns. I of course sold a little early (I could have gotten 10pts) but I am still working on getting these PAs back to their full trail. I will be looking to hold longer and for slightly bigger gains on some of these once I get that full trail back. 

However, I am happy with todays profits. Slow and steady wins this race. 

Truthfully I didn’t really see any solid plays throughout the rest of the day for me. 90% of the move up from 1045 to 1245 lacked proper support. And then we were in such a major supply/ resistance area that I wouldn’t have taken a long. Which I am glad I didn’t because it failed countless times before finally having a breakout with a major rejection. I would have gotten chopped up. 

Less is more in this market. I also have to be a realist and while I am not a perma bear nor perma bull and I play what is in front of me… it is extremely hard to justify being bullish with most of big tech (besides 3 tickers) are red, breadths are negative, vix is green (was for most of day) and the 10YR/ DXY are very green. 

Green is green and I am very content with my days profits and will look to do it again tomorrow.

If you remember last week I mentioned the banking issues. Today NYCB (the one that inherited signature bank that failed) is now in talks with regulators… what I also find fascinating about this is the fact that Yellen was asked about Regional banks and banks in general today but refused to comment on them. If they were healthy and happy… I don’t see Yellen refusing to comment.

I brought this up yesterday with DXY and the 10YR Yield being on such an incredible bounce while markets did nothing. This shows accurately how wild that bounce is and how much disparity there is right now. Over the last two days (this was from yesterday) the 10yr moved up higher than it had since June 2022. During June 2022 we saw a 13% drop on SPY. Currently SPY is green over 4 days right now. 

I remain under the bias that its is far too early to short this market… and whenever it is finally time to short this market it is going to drop so fast and heavy that its going to feel like fomo.

Incredibly here on SPY we did not get a new supply today and instead are playing out a really nice bull flag here. 

Currently on SPY 493.76 to 494.38 is our critical resistance area. We did see a small drop in buyers today also. 

We have a nice support area at the daily 8ema and 490.84 supply that I would expect us to bounce off if this retrace continues. 

Bulls need to break through the critical 493.76 to 494.38 resistance area with the support of buyers. 

Bears have a window of opportunity to take this lower and under the daily 8ema support near 490 (projected) tomorrow. IF they can do that we have another potential breakdown to the daily 20ema support near 485 (projected) over the next few days.

Despite intraday weakness today the last 10 minutes of the day once again saved the techicals. Buyers came in to support this upside and we even got a new demand at 4961. 

We did not quite come back down to the daily 8ema support of 4938 today to retest that. We have found some extremely strong support around the 4956-4959 area intraday too. 

Bulls need to bounce and close over the supply of 4974 with buyers returning to break us out and get a new daily demand. 

Bears again have an opportunity here to break under the daily 8ema support of 4938 (projected) to then target the daily 20ema support near 4900 (projected).

I actually am surprised to not see a new daily supply here today on QQQ. We once again saw buyers weaken on QQQ which allowed bears to backtest the daily 8ema support. We for the 2nd day in a row held that support. We however are now back inside the same 416.95-428.17 range that we have traded inside of for the last 13 days. 

Bulls need to use these daily 8ema support bounces to push back over 428.17 and target a new ATHs with proper daily buyer support. 

Bears with this bearish engulfing candle and potential failed breakout here have an opportunity to drop us under 8ema support of 424.9 (projected). This would allow that bigger backtest of the daily 20ema support near 420 (projected).

I mentioned yesterday after we failed to breakout and close over 17701 supply that it was our ultimate resistance to watch and keep an eye on. Today we once again found that level to be resistance. This is now 7 rejections and failures to close over 17701 supply. However, we once again for the third day in a row saw bears fail to close under its daily 8ema support of 17560.

Bulls need to use these daily 8ema support bounces to push through 17701 resistance/ supply and close well over that area with daily buyers supporting the price. 

Bears could use this 7th rejection off 17701 as an opportunity to drop us lower under that daily 8ema support and then target daily 20ema support near 17400 (projected).

After two (Really three) massive days on the 10yr yield we are seeing a major retrace here (unsurprisingly). We came into that critical 4.16% to 4.207% triple supply area and had a really hard rejection. 

The daily 8 and 20ema supports of 4.067% has held so far. 

Bears want to see another bounce off daily 8/20ema support here and run it back to 4.16% to 4.207%.

Bulls want to see this triple supply hold and drop us back under this daily 8/20ema support to retarget a move to 3.863%.

Similarly here on DXY after the massive two day push we saw a small retrace today. We did not get a new supply and are holding nicely onto 104.083-104.165 which was previously resistance and now is attempting to be support. 

Bulls want to see this back under 103.541 supply minimally.

Bears want to see this hard bounce off 104.083-104.165 and push to that 105.086 demand area.

313,Very Favourable Risk-to-Reward Play for $GROY,"Hello all! Sorry for the slight delay in getting this analysis over to you; I was caught up in travel yesterday. Just a quick reminder, this is purely for sharing insights, not financial advice (nfa)! Today, we're focusing on $GROY. This setup offers a 2.67 risk-to-reward ratio, indicating you need a win rate of just 37% to stay in the green.

https://preview.redd.it/28h2p4zp36hc1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=24750c18a1fd83df550b86c206d95bfe0ce4bbf2

In the chart, there are three blue highlighted zones to pay attention to:

* The lowest blue zone marks significant support (which we've successfully rebounded from).
* The middle blue zone shows a congested area, suggesting two actions: a) adjusting your stop loss higher to safeguard gains or b) booking some profits.
* The upper blue zone is our aim for GROY's upcoming movement. My absolute stop loss (SL) is placed at $1.26 because dropping below this level means our assumptions are no longer valid, prompting a reevaluation of our entry points and overall strategy for this asset.

321,"Bulls Finally Hit $5000 ES… 2-7-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

To show how strong this rally is when you look at the average analysts prediction of where SPX will end the year at… we are already 2.8% above that average… the high side extreme sits at 5400 SPX which is only about 8% more from here.

If you remember on February 1st when we had that massive bounce and pop it was the 4th time we had seen that pattern play out. The target was $506-$507 by February 20th. We are currently 9 days and less than $8 from that target. Markets continue to push for this same daily 20ema support test and then pump. 

Poor SPX couldn’t even officially get to 5000 today… it came 11 cents short this reminds me a lot of the move on Friday for ES to fall just short of hitting 5000 itself.

The one thing I will say about the last 2-3 days is that this is the weakest I have seen bulls in a very long time. A majority of the price action is still occurring after hours (lower volume) and we are still mostly getting an explosive opening hour that then fails to do anything the rest of the day. 

Its been a long time since I can honestly say that bulls have not been in control on every candle. It could just be that as we near $500 SPY and $5000 SPX that their strength/ momentum are fizzling out as this is a huge psychological milestone for the markets.

Pre-market early this morning we got news that NYCB was not going to have any bank run issues essentially. The markets rallied aggressively off this from basically 7am till open which left a really nice gap up here on the daily. 

We came dangerously close to $500 but just could not get there despite making a new ATHs. 

We do have daily buyers supporting this new ATHS. I am looking for a continuation of this bull move to the green trend line near 501 tomorrow. That green trend line uses the peaks of 12/1/22 and 7/27/23 to form a nice resistance line. This trend line effectively is our recovery bull channels resistance line since our bear market low in October 2022. 

Bears will look to close back under 492.1 (projected) which is the daily 8ema support in order to start a downside correction.

Here on ES we have the same green trend line that gives us a resistance of 5062 to watch tomorrow. Thanks to daily buyers coming at the strongest level since 1/30/23 we were able to get a massive breakout and breakout over that key 4974 supply/ resistance. 

The way buyers struggled today I wouldn’t be surprised to see a nice daily double top tomorrow. 

Key support now sits at the daily 8ema support which will be right around that 4961-4974 supply/ demand area. Bears will need to close under this level in order to see a bigger downside correction. 

Overall the bulls will look to continue this march higher and will again target that 5060 area and eventually 5100.

Now on QQQ we have a resistance line using the 10/12/23 and 1/24/24 highs to form the trend line that sits at the 439 area tomorrow (green). This is also where another trend line (red) sits using the 12/20/23 and 1/24/24 resistance points. 

Truthfully despite daily buyers returning to the markets today I do no think the bulls have the strength to push us that high tomorrow. 

The most important thing to note from today is that QQQ (and NQ) finally broke out of its 12 day long consolidation range. The previous resistance of 428.17 will become support now and will be where the bears need to retrace markets underneath in order to be back in control.

In an extremely bullish move today NQ after 7 failed attempts was able to breakout and close over that critical 17701 supply/ resistance. 

With this breakout and closure over that level here it does open the opportunity for NQ to breakout to the red trend line resistance. I do not expect us to get there tomorrow but I do see 18000+ as the next major level NQ will look to break into. 

Bears now need to close back under the daily 8ema support of 17675 (projected) and the previous supply of 17701.

322,"Tisdale Clean Energy (TCEC.c) Expands Funding for Uranium Exploration Following Successful Private Placement (Upsizes Next Tranche of PP), CEO Buys Shares on Open Market","Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. (Ticker: TCEC.c or TCEFF for US investors) has recently accomplished a significant milestone by successfully closing the second tranche of its non-brokered private placement, generating $1,145,199 in gross proceeds. This achievement, coupled with the initial offering, elevates the total funds raised to $1,920,199, reflecting investor confidence in the company's vision and projects.

Of particular note is the recent displays of internal confidence by TCEC's CEO, who continued to bolster the company's stance by purchasing over $93k worth of TCEC shares in January alone. Furthermore, his commitment was underscored today with further share acquisitions on the open market.

https://preview.redd.it/wvnyet8vt8hc1.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=93d08c045cf93cae0d69973adec47fdfe8f28bc4

Building upon the momentum, TCEC has decided to capitalize on the strong market interest by expanding its PP offering, potentially reaching gross proceeds of $3,000,000 if fully subscribed. The final tranche is slated to conclude within the next two weeks, subject to regulatory approvals.

These newly acquired funds will be pivotal in advancing Tisdale's strategic objectives, particularly in addressing general working capital requirements and executing exploration programs at the South Falcon East uranium project. Situated in Saskatchewan, Canada, the project spans 12,770 hectares within the prolific Athabasca Basin region and hosts the Fraser Lakes B uranium/thorium deposit.

In collaboration with partner Skyharbour (SYH.v), TCEC recently received an updated historical NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for the deposit, revealing substantial inferred uranium and thorium resources. The deposit boasts 6,960,681 pounds of U3O8 inferred at an average grade of 0.03% U3O8 and 5,339,219 pounds of ThO2 inferred at an average grade of 0.023% ThO2 within 10,354,926 tonnes, indicating significant potential for expansion.

Looking ahead, TCEC is gearing up for a 2000-meter drill program in early 2024, strategically targeting high-grade areas to enhance the existing resource base.

330,The fall of wallstreetbets,"In the halcyon days of Reddit, there existed a page called Wall Street Bets. It was a wild, electric corner of the internet where amateur traders, self-proclaimed ""apes,"" and risk-takers gathered to discuss high-stakes investments and boast about their gains—or more often, their losses.

Among the cacophony of memes and YOLO (You Only Live Once) trades, two stocks emerged as the darlings of the community: AMC and GameStop. Their meteoric rise from obscure companies to household names was fueled by the collective frenzy of Wall Street Bets. Apes poured their savings into these stocks, driven by a belief in sticking it to the Wall Street establishment and a shared sense of camaraderie.

As AMC and GameStop soared to unprecedented heights, so did the spirits of the Wall Street Bets community. Each day brought new memes, new gains, and new tales of triumph against the odds. But as the saying goes, what goes up must come down.

The fall was as swift and brutal as the ascent. Hedge funds, seeing an opportunity to profit from the inevitable crash, began to short the stocks. Panic set in among the apes as prices tumbled, wiping out gains and leaving many with heavy losses.

Years later, you find yourself still a part of the community, though it's not quite the same. The electric atmosphere has dimmed, and the losses have taken their toll.

One evening, as you scroll through the latest posts on Wall Street Bets, a sense of nostalgia washes over you. In that moment, you realize that the glory days of AMC and GameStop have come to an end as well as this page. #ripwallstreetbets",1707415891,820038,Moneymovesfast,t2_a0cw96oh,e4a4df6adf2bce513c6ebcbf6353ac806ac61bf42809d8087a2672804e5bf057,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1am23ho/the_fall_of_wallstreetbets/

334,"SPX Touches $5000… 2-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

I have got to say this is easily the worst trading and market movement I have ever seen on ES (SPY). Today from 830am until almost EOD we held in a tight 5pt or 50cent range. This market is just pinned and has not been able to make a solid move the last three days. 

The way this market is trading is that buyers finally are reaching exhaustion and people are taking profits here (sellers). However, despite people finally taking profits (or buyers exhausting) we have not quite reached a price point where sellers are able to take full control again. 

Algos have just been ping ponging price back and forth inside a tight range. What impressed me even more today is the fact that for the whole day (atleast until EOD) NQ was in a solid uptrend and continued to breakout while ES actually held in a bear trend and made new LODs. Havent seen this strong of and sustained of divergence on ES/ NQ in a very long time. 

Whats truly incredible is the fact that before mid afternoon ES (SPY) was very weak while NQ (QQQ) was very strong which basically kept the markets from breaking out and from breaking down. However, around mid afternoon it actually flipped to where ES was strong and NQ was weak which again kept markets pinned in the same choppy range. 

The last time we had this tight of a range that lasted all day was 12/28/23 where markets closed inside a 5pt range (15min chart) all day and never broke a 12pt total range on ES. 

&#x200B;

For reference, that 12/28 was also a Thursday and it actually led to a 8 day long 2.36% correction on SPY. IF we are setting up a similar pattern which ironically enough  12/20/23 was a massive red day and the top (12/28) was 5 days after that pump. Our massive drop was on 1/31/24 and we are officially at 6 days post pump. A 2.36% drop over 8 days would put SPY at 487.7 by 2/16/24. 

Its important to note that correction was a great dip buying opportunity and I remain firm on my belief that until we see a closure and more than one day closed under daily 20ema support everything in the long run is a dip buying opportunity. 

&#x200B;

Fun fact is SPX can close above 4958.61 tomorrow (Friday) it will officially set the record for the biggest gain over a 15 week period (where all but one week was green).

I am very intrigued to see these new numbers… last time they did this a lot of the data was far hotter than previously expected or presented. 

SIDE NOTE- my bold prediction is that we see a bank fail this weekend and markets have a massive correction next week. I could be wrong but the perfect scenario for it is there… they always wait till markets closed and it’s the weekend to do it.

The daily chart remains in extreme bull momentum and also remains with stronger daily buyers to support these higher closes. We had a very choppy day today and as I mentioned in the introduction it seems we are seeing some sort of level of buyers exhaustion start to form. 

Historically over the last 15 weeks of this bull run I would say that Fridays are generally not only trend days but also bullish days. 

We once again saw bulls come in to support this trend EOD after being absent almost all day long. 

I could see bulls making a run for $500 tomorrow to close the week out on a very high and very bullish note.

This is one nasty and ugly candle here on the daily for ES. We technically played out the double top today (as mentioned yesterday) but we played it out in one of the ugliest possible ways. 

Despite historical trends of Friday I actually think we might be finding a temporary top and like mentioned previously when we had a similar day in December we could see a drop tomorrow. 

I had no problem most of this drive up being bullish and thinking things will just continue to push, however, this is the weakest bulls have been this whole drive (or at least the strongest sellers have been).

We ended up edging a new ATHs here on NQ and also closed out a very tiny doji candle. Despite the fact that buyers continued to come in to support this upside we again saw buyers appear to be exhausted. 

QQQ is still working its way to its grander target of 435-440. 

428.17 (supply) and daily 8ema support (near same level) is key support to watch going forward.

NQ also played out the daily double top today and closed out a doji despite having the buyers to support further upside. 

17701 will remain key support and I would not be surprised to see that backtested tomorrow or early next week. It was such a strong resistance level that it would be uncommon to not at least backtest it to see if it holds. 

Bulls are still looking for 18000 as their bigger upside move.

The 10YR yields bounce off the daily 8/20ema support at 4.065% yesterday led to a really nice bounce back to this triple supply area of 4.16% to 4.207%. This appears to be a continuation candle which should lead to a formal test of this upper 4.178% to 4.207% area. IF this does lead to a breakout to and over this triple supply area that could (and should) certainly lead to a bigger breakdown on the markets. 

If this triple supply area can hold and reject then we will look for bulls to move price back to the 8/20ema support near 4.076% to 4.096%.

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.16% -> 4.178% -> 4.207%

DXY also had a massive bounce off its daily 8ema support of 103.903 to put in a new demand at 104.029. DXY went al the way up almost to the penny to perfectly touch and reject the 104.446 supply. 

Bulls need to use this as a hard rejection to dump us back under 8ema support of 103.903.

Bears have a potential bull flag playing out here which will lead to a breakout and closure over 104.446 and a potential drop in the markets.

341,🚀 Diving Into Dividend-Paying Tech Giants: A February Shopping List,"In the realm of tech investments, dividends aren't typically the headline grabber. However, amidst the market's ebbs and flows, dividends stand as beacons of steady income. For those eyeing the tech sector for both growth and income, let's zoom into three dividend-paying titans worth considering this February.  


1️⃣ Meta Platforms Takes a Leap 💡

Surprise! $META (Meta Platforms Inc), a name not traditionally linked with dividends, has just declared its first-ever dividend of $0.50 per share, set for payout on March 26. This move comes after Meta's impressive revenue climb to $134.9 billion in 2023, a 16% jump from the previous year. With net income rocketing 69% to over $39 billion and a generous $80 billion authorized for share buybacks, Meta's foray into dividends seems well-supported. Plus, with $11.5 billion in free cash flow in Q4 alone, Meta's new dividend journey looks promising for long-term sustainability.

&#x200B;

2️⃣ TSMC: The Semiconductor Sovereign 🏭

$TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd - ADR) operates in the shadows but shines brightly in the tech world. Its pivotal role in semiconductor manufacturing has positioned TSMC as a cornerstone of the industry. Despite the cyclical nature of semiconductor demand, TSMC's commitment to its quarterly dividend of $0.48 — yielding about 1.6% — stands firm. Since initiating dividends in 2004, TSMC has maintained a reliable payout, underlining its indispensable presence in tech's vast landscape.

&#x200B;

3️⃣ AT&T: A Telecom Titan 📱

$T (AT&T Inc), a name synonymous with dividends within tech, continues to allure investors with its substantial yield. Following the WarnerMedia spinoff and dividend cut, AT&T's yield remains enviable at approximately 6.4%. This pivot back to its core telecom business has spurred a resurgence in wireless and Fiber growth, reinforcing AT&T's enduring relevance. With $16.8 billion in free cash flow in 2023, AT&T's dividend appears secure, offering a tempting pick for those seeking steady returns.

🔍 The Takeaway

In a landscape where tech equities are prized for their explosive growth, these three companies highlight the sector's potential for delivering reliable income through dividends. Whether it's Meta's debut dividend, TSMC's industry backbone status, or AT&T's high yield, each offers a unique blend of growth and income, catering to investors looking for the best of both worlds.",1707488443,820648,JuriGagarin,t2_hr1kl,b7b9586d36d4c1e2e9b1bf424c6a6c83ed9738a1bdcc36b7a9b55e283d5a6b50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1amp7ii/diving_into_dividendpaying_tech_giants_a_february/

347,"SPY Finally Breaks $500… All Eyes on CPI Next Week… 2-9-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

Exactly 8 days ago I was looking for SPY to hit $500 and we have officially hit that level. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/230fdk8komhc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f12036db10f3660619b55cbf9fe1ae70450996f2

However, my bigger target is actually $506-507 by February 20th based on the way this market has been moving. 

We have officially hit ES $5000, SPX $5000, SPY $500 and NQ $18000. These were all of the big milestones I have been looking for. The question is whats next? ES/ SPX $6000? SPY $600? NQ $20,000? 

It took SPY…

$350-$400= 32 Days  
 $400-$450= 241 Days  
 $450-$500= 210 Days  
 

Could we see SPY $550 by September 16th 2024 and SPY $600 by April 24th 2024?

For reference the other times markets hit major 1000 mark milestones… 60% of the time 1 month and 3 months later markets were higher, 6 months later market was higher 100% of the time and 12 months later 80% of the time markets were higher… the theme? Markets are likely to continue to go higher.

Next week is a major week because we have CPI on Tuesday as of right now there is no consensus nor forecasts so I can not quite give you numbers yet. Monday night I will get some numbers pushed out on my expectations. Other notable things are jobless claims and PPI. Preliminarily based off Cleveland fed and consensus we are looking at some very bullish CPI numbers and potentially one of the largest drops in CPI YoY in a while and could end up back in the 2s. 

&#x200B;

This is officially the best 15 week period (of gains) in the history of the stock market for SPX… whats even more wild? The other 4 times this happened stocks were higher 1 month later 100% of the time… however only 75% of the time was stocks higher 3, 6 and 9 months later. 

Looks like this bull runs just getting started… I truly (and will die on this pedestal) do not see any reason to short this market. The only thing stopping this bull market is a true black swan event. And honestly it would have to be a major black swan not like 2023 bank run that fizzled out in a week… gotta be something that shocks the market to the point we either get a surprise rate cut or even an emergency rate cut. Until then its just up.

SPY weekly just continues to slowly burn to the upside here with an impressive 14th green week out of the last 15 weeks of trading. 

We continues to see extremely weekly bull momentum and continue to see weekly buyers come in to support this price. 

Our yellow bull channels resistance sits around 509.52 for next week which is about another 2% up. There is the red resistance line which is from the overall 2022-2024 bull market trend that sits around 520.46 and about 4% higher. We have CPI next week and that historically can be a pretty strong movement week. 

Bulls remain in full control here and I see our bounce area likely being 490 if we drop which is the weekly 8ema support (projected). 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 475.46  
 Demand- 467.96

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

Same story here on ES though in that we have extreme weekly bull momentum and we continue to see weekly buyers support the upside. The one thing I noticed (on SPY too) is the fact that we are seeing volatility pick up a lot on the weekly time frame. It is the highest level of volatility since the October lows. Generally this COULD indicate a potential reversal is coming. However, it just indicates that there is more of a fight happening here than the previous weeks, which makes sense when you look at the choppiness of the last two weeks. 

The yellow bull trend line sits near 5140 and the red bull trend line sits near 5218 as potential weekly breakout targets. 

The weekly 8ema support should come in near 4950 area (projected) and that likely will be support if we were to see any weakness. 

ES FUTURES WEEKLY  
 Supply- 4771

The same story here on QQQ as we do have weekly buyers to support price action and we are in as extreme weekly bull momentum as we could possibly be in right now. 

The yellow bull channel resistance is actually perfectly aligned with the red bull channel resistance and that sits near 447.1 for next week which is about a 2.4% move up on markets. 

The weekly 8ema support is going to push over that 421.21/423.1 supply and demand support area to hold near 427 (projected) if the markets see weakness next week that is likely where we would find our support. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 421.21

Here on NQ weekly we also have backtested and confirmed that 17460 is support which the weekly 8ema will now be over for next week (projected). The weekly extreme bull momentum with weekly buyers likely will look to continue this push up.

The yellow bull channel resistance sits near 18329 and the red bull channel resistance sits near 18490.

NQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16957  
 Demand- 17460

**US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p72hg3rnomhc1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=1220ca9429fbc01a9b3259b24aee1ef66057c546

From a weekly perspective the 10YR weekly chart here is actually quite interesting. We had a three point weekly resistance line of a bear channel that dates back to middle of October 2023 that we officially broke out of this week. 

With a breakout (and oddly enough perfectly correlated with ES/ NQs bull channels) the 10YR could see a major push up which could certainly cause the markets to take a leg down. 

Realistically for the last 9 weeks now the 10YR has formed a nice base of consolidation here and has turned 3.867%-4.032% into major support/ demand. If this level can hold and the 10YR breaks out over and holds over 4.244% next week I would be very surprised not to see the market take a leg down. 

Now if this supply area here can hold as resistance and we start a move lower that would certainly after weeks of consolidation potentially provide some upside support on the markets. 

The CPI data on Tuesday is likely to cause quite the move on the 10YR. 

US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.161% -> 4.244%  
 Demand- 3.867% -> 4.032% -> 4.225%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vatk1l6oomhc1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e8db9c4d51bdaca9f5cc5dcba5238c05464cb68

Zooming way out here on the weekly DXY chart because I think its important to show you what resistance line we are coming into. IF you take the top on 9/26/22 and 10/30/23 you form a really nice resistance line that perfectly makes a massive weekly bear channel. If you remember the important of the week of 9/26 and 10/30 it was near the bottom of when ES/ NQ started major rallies. Those major rallies were market by major peaks on DXY. 

IF you look at this weeks candle you can see its actually a major doji (reversal lower) candle. IF we see DXY reject here and start a major sell off this could start yet another massive multi-week long bull run on the markets. 

However, if DXY breaks out next week and pushes through that red weekly resistance level of 105.108 then we are breaking a major bear trend on DXY and I would be surprised (especially with the 10yr breakout pattern) to see markets continue their rally. 

On DXY we have a major resistance area of 104.009-105.591 and now have a major support area of 99.924-101.705. 

DXY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.009 -> 105.591  
 Demand- 99.924 -> 101.705 -> 108.938

**CL/ OIL FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

Taking a look at Oil here which I like to reference for CPI potentials numbers… we are up about 2% on Oil since the previous month of CPI data. The last time we had a rise on CPI data we had CPI YoY rise by 0.3% and CORE YoY rose 0.3%. If that plays out again we could see another rise in CPI. Now based off the Cleveland fed/ consensus numbers I do not forsee that happening though. 

But we certainly could miss to the upside from expectations but still see lower than previous. 

Looking at oil here we continue to base here and have once again put in another weekly demand at 72.32. We now have 5 demands (supports) from 66.85-72.32 however we have not been able to break through that 78.31-80 supply/ demand area. 

Right now Oil has been on a three month long consolidation. I do see what could resemble a bear flag playing out here which could bring in a major drop in oil. However, I also see weekly buyers coming back in and what could potentially be a cup and handle forming here too which would lead to a major weekly breakout.

352,I JUST LIKE THE STONK!!! (Pirate)," Hey WSBnew, first post

Ill make this simple.

It will happen again.

Was scanning for stonks and found a good stonk that had unusually high SI.

lMPP.

ImperiaI PetroIeum is a major player in the oil transportation game. They've got a sweet fleet of ships hauling everything from gasoline to crude oil across the high seas. Founded by industry pros who know how to make that cash flow, these guys are all about growing their fleet fast and hitting up that spot market for big bucks.

They've got some serious vessels in their lineup, like the Suez Max tankers that can handle huge loads and the Aframax ships for moving crude oil around. Plus, they've got more ships on the way, set to arrive next year.

With everything going on with the wars etc, I think things will get even crazier with the economy and resource economies.

Short Interest is rising every month by nearly double (as if a firm is doubling down on it) whilst the price keeps rising.

I think the numbers say it all. They have earnings on the 12th and Ill find this interesting if price goes higher and so does the short interest that will come out on the 15th data. If so, short interest data will probably be nearing 80%, if so, someone is shorting awfully alot....hmmmm

Option chain open interest for 4/19 calls are booming.

More inflows than outflows.

Shares = 16.8 mill. Shares shorting = 11.8 mill

Undervalued, at least by 5x.

I have no investment in this as im a brokie atm, but wanted to get peoples thoughts on the Stonk, for my own evalutation and confirm my own bias.

Im still new, so I could be terribly wrong but is this not how gm3 started?

To my knowledge, there has not been any new regulation since Gm3 to prevent another Gm3-like fiasco. Do they really believe it wont happen again?

358,SmartMetric says its Gen4 Self Powered Biometric Finger Scan Card Is Perfectly Designed to Meet the Needs of the 518 Million Credit Cards Issued in the United States,"SmartMetric, Inc. (OTC: SMME) A fingerprint scan credit card is a type of biometric card that uses a built-in fingerprint scanner to verify the identity of the cardholder when they try to make a payment. This technology is designed to enhance the security and convenience of credit card transactions, especially for contactless payments as well as standard contact payments and ATM transactions.

&#x200B;

Better protection of your data: Unlike PINs, fingerprint data is encrypted and is only stored in the card, bypassing the need for a central database connected to the internet, protecting a card user’s sensitive data from hackers1. Additionally, the technology safeguards against duplicated 2D and rubber fingerprints because it requires electrical capacitive sensing. In addition, the SmartMetric biometric credit/debit card has an inbuilt hardware based live fingerprint detection created by SmartMetric and only available on the SmartMetric biometric credit/debit card.

&#x200B;

Even more convenience: Credit cards save consumers time and allow them to pay quickly. With a fingerprint scan credit card, you don’t need to remember or enter a PIN, which can speed up the checkout process and reduce the risk of forgetting or losing your PIN. At the moment the card issuing brands such as Visa and Mastercard are not proposing to eliminate the use of a PIN with a biometric card. Discussion in Europe by Banking regulators is actively talking about the doing away with the widely accepted ""insecure"" PIN when users use a fingerprint scan credit/debit card. Credit card networks already have the ability to turn off PIN usage which they do for some low-cost transactions such as buying a coffee. Logic would have it as biometric credit cards proliferate non-PIN usage will expand without restriction to fingerprint biometric scan cards.

&#x200B;

Works with existing POS infrastructure: SmartMetric fingerprint scan credit cards are compatible with existing point-of-sale terminals that accept chip or contactless payments, so merchants don’t need to invest in new equipment or software to accept them. However, more recent players who are trying to test reader powered finger scan credit cards that rely on the power from the reader are trapped in having their cards not able to work at most Gas Stations, ATM’s and many restaurants that don’t have portable card readers that are brought to the table.

&#x200B;

The stark functional deficits of non-self-powered fingerprint scan credit/debit cards compared to the SmartMetric internally powered ready to use at all times and all situations, fingerprint scan card is best explained in the following.

&#x200B;

Non-Self Powered Fingerprint Scan Card

&#x200B;

Only works when inserted into a card reader therefore limiting use of the card and not able to be used in all card user situations. These cards rely on the user touching the cards fingerprint sensor while the other end of the card with the contact chip is held in the reader. This allows the card to power the fingerprint scan only through the power from the card reader going into the card. So these cards are limited to readers that only partially insert the card into a reader. Otherwise, they have no power of their own to perform a fingerprint scan. Some of the places these none-powered cards will NOT work in are:

ATM’s that swallow the card whole

Restaurants that do not have a portable card reader but require the card to be taken from the table for transaction processing

Gas station pumps that like ATM’s swallow the card whole

Transit ticket dispensers that swallow the card whole

Parking station ticket machines that swallow the card whole

Non-Self Powered finger scan credit or debit cards require the user to go to a bank branch to have their fingerprint scanned and then transferred onto the card via a secure fingerprint capture device. This is bothersome to the card user. It raises trust issues about having the bank involved in the capture of the user’s fingerprint. For large scale credit issuers that rely on mass mailing of new and replacement credit cards requiring their customers to have to come into a bank branch just will not work.

SmartMetric Self Powered Finger Scan Card

&#x200B;

The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card because it has its own internal rechargeable power, scans the cared user’s finger prior to the card being inserted into a credit card reader. Therefore, the card is able to be used at all existing and types of credit card readers without the stark limitations of the non-self-powered fingerprint scan cards.

The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card does not require the card user to go into a bank branch to register their fingerprint on the card. Nor does it alternatively need a separate secure card reading device to be sent out to the card user for in home fingerprint download into the card. The SmartMetric finger scan card user simply touches the cards fingerprint sensor four (4) times an instantly their fingerprint is scanned and securely stored inside the card. No user friction. Instant fingerprint capture and store because the card is self-powered and acts immediately as a fingerprint scanner.

Mass credit card issuers who rely on mail distribution for the credit cards need not to change the way they do business. SmartMetric finger scan cards are easily shipped to homes through the mail and without fuss or user friction are easily set up for future card use by the user’s fingerprint.

The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card works at ALL card readers such as:

ATM’s

Restaurants that take the card from the table to process (user touches the sensor which turns on the card for up to 8 minutes giving the table server enough time to have the card processed)

Gas pumps

Parking ticket vending machines

Transit ticket vending machines

""Because of the limitations of the user and card issuer experience we believe that trials and testing of the non-self-powered cards under way in Europe are doomed to failure. Much like inferior electric vehicles are failing in the market while Tesla continues to grow exponentially with its model Y becoming the biggest selling vehicle globally. Failed poorly thought-out products fail because no one wants them while it doesn’t distract from new innovations success trajectory when the new innovators get the product to align with customers expectations,"" said SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

&#x200B;

It has taken years of research and development to perfect the internal power system within the SmartMetric finger scan card. Millions of dollars in research and development have been invested to create the only card of its kind in the world that will work at all card readers. A card that is simple to download your fingerprint into the card at home without the fear and inconvenience of going somewhere else to have your fingerprint scanned and stored into the card.

&#x200B;

The SmartMetric finger scan card is light years ahead and brings the reality of full biometric security technology to the ubiquitous credit and debit card world.

&#x200B;

Credit cards still dominate the way consumer make payments. Non credit card payments such as phones account for less than 5% of payment transactions while the majority of transactions are done using either a credit or debit card.

&#x200B;

According to a report published by Forbes Adviser on March 9, 2023 ""Over the past year, nearly half the population (47.5%) opened at least one new account, bringing the total number of accounts to over 518 million by the end of 2022."" 1

&#x200B;

The mass market version of the SmartMetric Gen4 biometric credit card is now under manufacture following the successful testing of the cards new and advanced internal operating system on the new card hardware platform.

&#x200B;

Currently the card is under manufacture which involves the electronic assembly and separately the cards lamination turning it into a credit card is underway in Asia. The cards internal software including its operating system has been tested by the SmartMetric group of engineers in Tel Aviv, Israel.

&#x200B;

""While we have experienced unbelievable challenges and delays, we are very excited about being able to very soon show our finished mass production biometric finger scan card to the world,"" said Chaya Hendrick.

&#x200B;

We are protected by issued patents in the United States with pending patents in Asia and Europe and other parts of the World.

&#x200B;

By far our biggest patent protection revolves around issued design patents granted by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) that grant protection against any product design such as a smart card or credit chip card that has in any one of multiple variations a fingerprint sensor on it. ""None of the other biometric card manufacturers who in our opinion are wasting their time with an inferior none self-powered card, will be able to sell such cards in the United States because of the issued patents,"" said Chaya Hendrick.

&#x200B;

""Design Patents are easily enforced and the owner or licensee of such patents can have offending products seized at a port of entry or at a place of business in the USA without much effort,"" said Chaya Hendrick.

&#x200B;

Utility patents can take years of legal fighting however design patents are based on does the product look like what is patented in the design patent and if so then it is infringing.

&#x200B;

""We are confident that if a Bank in the USA wants to issue biometric finger scan cards in the USA that have a chip and a fingerprint sensor on them, then they will need to deal with SmartMetric,"" said Chaya Hendrick.

Should we just assume Shitty leadership and expect doom as bag holders with ZOM?

362,"Bulls Pump Into CPI… 2-12-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

The long awaited CPI day has finally arrived… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/18egizhzz7ic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=21495fd561eb471c7d64043a7be5224fa0c91b2d

Cpi Swaps are pricing in 2.93% reading for tomorrow also with the average being 2.94%... the question will be does markets round up to 3% or down to 2.9%? 

I am more bullish going into this CPI than I have ever been for a CPI. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cd1mjr1008ic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1df0fc46a779f71769e53d073a54a3e4d3f8d1e

Why do I think this CPI reading is so bullish and why I do I not see a single bearish case for tomorrow? Its simply the fact that if we actually get the 2.9% reading which consensus, bloomberg and cleveland fed says we will get this will be the lowest CPI reading since April 13th 2021 when CPI came in at 2.6%. This would be an even lower reading than the July 12 2023 reading which showing CPI at 3.0%. This would almost certainly be enough reason to (and I quote JPOW here) “to give the fed confidence in CPI.”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy77ngi008ic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=641ca5d3f89b959113afe1aab51ad9a8f183aba0

In addition assuming that CORE YoY comes in below 3.9% tomorrow (Bloomberg and consensus shows 3.7% as of now) then that is a major win for the fed on the CPI front. For the last 9 CPI readings in a row CORE has either fallen or remained unchanged. Since its peak at 6.6% on October 13th 2022 CORE has only rose one time (went from 5.5% to 5.6% March 2023 to April 2023). That would make 16 months of progress in lowering inflation according to core. If we get a 3.8% or lower reading tomorrow it will be the lowest CORE YoY has been since either June 10th 2021 (if we are 3.8%) or May 12 2021 (if we are 3.7% or lower). While this is certainly not 2% like the fed wants… between CPI YoY and CORE YoY there is little reason for the fed to stay this restrictive.

Even looking at the analysts estimates (posted below this) you can see the markets are pricing in some massively bullish numbers… median, mean and consensus all say 2.9% CPI YoY and 3.7% CORE YoY which would give us (as mentioned again) the lowest CPI YoY and CORE YoY since late Spring 2021…

Taking a look at SPY daily here we have been on a massive bull run and we are starting to fight up against that red trend line of resistance for this pump. Today we did finally see buyers weaken on the daily and we did get a nice doji double top with a new supply at 501.15.

501.15 is now resistance and the level for bulls to close over in order to push for the next major resistance which is the red trend line near 505.

Bears do have an opportunity to take this down to daily 8ema support near 487 (projected). 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 490.84 -> 501.15

Es also put in a really nice double top doji reversal with a new supply at 5043 and also saw buyers weaken on the daily timeframe. 

I usually would be fairly bearish based strictly on the technical pattern here but with CPI data for tomorrow I am not quite thinking bearish here. 

Bulls will look to push back through 5043 and target a move to the 5080-5100 area. 

Bears could attempt a move back to daily 8ema support near 4998 (projected). 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4974 -> 5043  
 Demand- 4961

QQQ also put in a nice doji reversal double top with a supply at 437.19 today. 

The bulls will look to breakout through 437.19 supply tomorrow and target a move to the green trend line near 441.1.

The bears could target a move down to the daily 8ema support near 431.8 (projected). 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 428.17 -> 437.19

NQ also got a new supply with this double top today at 18039. With this move bears could start to target a move down to the daily 8ema support near 17850 (projected). 

However, bulls will attempt to breakout over the supply of 18038 and target a bigger breakout to 18200+.

The 10YR put in a new supply today also at 4.188% which continues to reject this 4.188-4.207% resistance area. If we get a cool CPI reading tomorrow I would not be surprised to see a sizeable sell off on the 10yr back under daily 8, 20 and 50ema supports of 4.095-4.129%.

However, if markets tend to not like the CPI reading for whatever then I would start to target a breakout over this 4.188-4.207%. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.188 -> 4.207 -> 4.289%  
 Demand- 3.863%

DXY actually put in a new supply on Friday at 104.158 which makes a nice double supply/ resistance zone here on dxy that matches the 10yrs. 

The daily 8ema support for now is holding well at 103.984.

If the CPI is cool and markets receive it well we should see a drop and closure under the daily 8ema support of 103.984 and will begin to target the 20ema support near 103.621.

However, in the case of a bad CPI reading or just not received well we would look for a move back to 104.158-104.446.

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.158 -> 104.446  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 104.029

VIX once again had push up today despite markets being green most of the day. This actually was the first time the VIX has left a gap like this since January 12th (exactly a month). We did get a new demand at 12.79 also today. I would suspect if CPI comes in cool like expected to see VIX hard reject here and form a new supply based off the daily candles bodies resistance. 

The VIX would then once again work it way back to the 12s and would like continue the same senseless movement of the last 3 months that we have been seeing. 

This is the biggest move on the VIX since Jan 31st which led to a massive 1.31% pop on SPY the next day.",1707772400,821421,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,ad27a17dc532ff3a74410535b3603c961a6819e7d6ac412ea2a3be835b545678,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1apb6ys/bulls_pump_into_cpi_21224_spy_es_futures_qqq_nq/

Deluce distinguished Abitibi by its resilience and shareholder alignment, boasting over 50% insider ownership. The company remains committed to weathering market challenges while prioritizing shareholder interests.

Discussing the regional context, Deluce emphasized Abitibi's strategic foothold in Quebec's Abitibi region, celebrated for its abundant mineral wealth and historical gold production.

He highlighted the region's untapped potential for exploration, particularly in the burgeoning commodity bull market.

The dialogue centered on Abitibi's key endeavors, notably the recently acquired B26 Polymetallic Copper Deposit which strategically positions Abitibi for success with the potential to enhance the company's industry standing.

Last week, Abitibi unveiled the addition of a second drill at the B26 Polymetallic Deposit in Quebec as part of their ongoing winter drill program. 

The company aims to complete 10,000 meters by March, with plans for a fully funded 30,000-meter field season in 2024. 

The program targets assessing open-pit potential and expanding the high-grade underground resource. 

Five holes have been completed, focusing on three specific areas along strike: the B26 Main Deposit, Satellite West, and Eastern Extension. The meticulous approach underscores the company's commitment to exploration excellence.

372,SmartMetric Says Credit Card Fraud Is Immense With Projected Global Losses Reaching an Astounding $43 Billion by 2026,"SmartMetric, Inc. (OTC: SMME) A biometric fingerprint credit card is better than regular credit cards in several ways. Here are some of the advantages of using a biometric card:

&#x200B;

Enhanced security: A biometric card can verify your identity with your fingerprint, which is unique and difficult to forge. This can prevent unauthorized use of your card if it is lost or stolen. Unlike a PIN or a signature, your fingerprint cannot be guessed or copied by fraudsters.

&#x200B;

Convenience: A biometric card can make payments faster and easier, as you do not need to remember or enter a PIN or sign a receipt. You just need to touch your finger on the card and insert or tap it on the reader. This can also reduce the risk of forgetting or losing your PIN.

&#x200B;

Contactless payment: A biometric card can enable contactless payment, which is more hygienic and convenient than swiping or inserting your card. Contactless payment can also reduce the wear and tear of your card and the reader. Moreover, contactless payment can increase the transaction limit, as you do not need to enter a PIN for higher amounts.

&#x200B;

The financial repercussions of credit card fraud are immense, with projected global losses reaching an astounding $43 billion by 2026. In the United States alone, credit card fraud losses are projected to exceed $12.5 billion within the next two years. These figures underscore the urgent need for implementing robust fraud prevention strategies and leveraging advanced technologies to protect consumers and businesses from financial harm. 1

&#x200B;

Incorporating a biometric fingerprint identity scanner inside the credit card such as has been done by SmartMetric brings a powerful defense against credit card fraudsters using the power of biometrics.

&#x200B;

The SmartMetric Gen 4 Biometric Fingerprint Card has been developed to meet the specific demand of the credit card industry and credit card users for enhanced credit card security. The card has an in-the-card nano fingerprint scanner that is used to recognize the card holder’s fingerprint and on a fingerprint match, instantly turning on the card.

&#x200B;

""The mass market version of the SmartMetric Gen 4 biometric credit card is now under manufacture following the successful testing of the card's new and advanced internal operating system on the new card hardware platform,"" said SmartMetric's President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

&#x200B;

The SmartMetric biometric fingerprint recognition technology built inside of the credit and debit card uses embedded biometric technology to positively recognize the card holder, and then only after a positive fingerprint recognition, turn on the card's EMV contact and contactless payments chip.

&#x200B;

According to an article published by [Finder.com](https://Finder.com) 2 the number of credit card accounts open in the United States is 564,500,000. This is an all-time high for the United States.

&#x200B;

The average American owns three credit cards. 83% of Americans own at least one credit card. 14% of Americans own at least 10 credit cards.

I also pointed out throughout my TA that IF the CPI came in cool and IF the algos reacted favorably what could happen… no ones ever right 100% of the time… if we were we wouldn’t be here. 

&#x200B;

Also as you see above my predicted total range that CPI and CORE CPI would come inside of did play out perfectly. However, my prediction of the actual numbers and more importantly the algos reaction was incorrect. That is the gamble of playing data like this. You can be correct (or incorrect) and still be wrong on the direction. 

The one thing I find very interesting is the fact that the white house has so much panic and fud being put out this morning. I know it’s an election year and I am sure inflation on the rise and peak fed funds rate is less than ideal heading into an election… but it seems like the fed/ white house was really caught off guard on this one too. 

Honestly when you look at the numbers besides MOM rising I don’t see the panic… we had an actual upside miss (higher than previous) not too long ago and markets couldn’t care less… it seems odd to me that this reading is what takes markets down. 

For the first time since Decembers 2023 FOMC when JPOW said 3 rate cuts at MAX we are seeing the markets “start to believe the fed.” This market over the last two months has gone from almost 7 rate cuts at the peak of bull euphoria to now barely pricing in 4 rate cuts in 2024. 

Not only that but in the last two months we have gone from expecting a January rate cut (briefly) to expecting a March rate cut (fairly impressive odds for a while) to now expecting the first rate cut to come in June. 

This CPI Reading appears to have for now checked the bulls and buyers in a major way. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/252jqjky8fic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=430006b4152919b240d258024ba112f268ebd3ca

They said 2024 was going to be historical… we are looking at the longest streak of reading over 3.0% on CPI YoY since the late 80s right now. 

With all that being said… we have played this out 5 other times over the last almost 4 months of trading. All five times that the market has had some sort of strong sell off or negative reaction to data/ news or whatever the bulls the next day have come in and immediately bought it up. Will history repeat itself for a 6th time? 

11-13-23= 1.87%  
 12-7-23= 1.12%  
 12-21-23= 1.01%  
 1-17-24= 1.19%  
 2-1-24= 1.97%  
 Average= 1.432%

Looking at the previous 5 times this has happened (a major and strong sell off/ reaction) we have seen on average the following trading day recover 1.432% (on ES). Almost all of those times we have recovered all of the previous days drop. The biggest difference I am seeing today compared to those other five days though is how massively the VIX spiked today and held at HOD into EOD. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/faweva9z8fic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c171c6dbbfcbf3ffd1bc6312c3e52ea382445b00

For me we are at a critical point here where the bears once again have a window of opportunity to drop this market into a much larger 5-10% correction. However, until we break and close under daily 20ema support on ES/ NQ and more importantly hold a fully daily candle below that EMA support (to turn it into resistance) I still favor the bears choking like usual. 

Something to keep in mind in this market regardless of what you think should happen (this humbled me back in 2022 after the October CPI reading)… In order for the markets to sell off markets need 1. A reason to initially sell (today that is hotter than expected CPI) and 2. They need a reason to CONTINUE to sell. The question is do we have a reason to continue to sell? Are bulls convinced that this historical 15-16 week bull runs over? Or do buyers/ bulls still think they are going to miss the next 4 month rally? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p1i7morz8fic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a4f9837254c4d8a878fcf2c9487b8996ae5c65

The power hour pump once again played out and we would have if the bears could have held it down seen the reddest close on the markets in almost two years. 

Looking at the previous times the VIX pumped this much and what SPY did the following day… Note the VIX was up 29% at HOD however they crushed it during power hour). 

June 13th 2022= SPY down -0.3% (after dropping 10% in 4 days… around FOMC meeting)  
 May 5th 2022= SPY down -0.6% (after dropping 4.8% in 2 days… around FOMC meeting)  
 April 26th 2022= Spy up 0.26% (after dropping 7% in 3 days)  
 April 22nd 2022= SPY down -2.75% (after dropping 1.5% the day before)  
 September 20th 2021= SPY down 0.09% (after dropping 4.4% in 3 days)  
 May 12th 2021= SPY up 1.2% (after dropping 4.42% in 3 days)  
 February 25th 2021= SPY down 0.5% (after dropping 2.41% the day before)  
 January 27th 2021= SPY up 0.86% (after dropping 3.62% in two days)  
 

On average leading into these massive spikes on the VIX SPY would drop 4.77% over 2.4 days. 

Right now SPY is down 2.6% over two days. 62.5% of the time after a VIX spike like this markets closed red the following day averaging a drop of -0.85%... the 37.5% of the time that markets were higher the next day we saw +0.77%.

I am not quite fully ready to trust the bears to have continuation… something they have struggled with for the last 4 months… however, there is a very real possibility we just watched the markets top be put in yesterday… at least for a little while. 

If the bears let this one slip away tomorrow and they do not get a follow on day this was likely a one off reaction. This massive EOD recovery doesn’t bode well for bears going into tomorrow and makes me think we see a 6th massive recovery day (as described above).

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q39gee809fic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c523c3019ffab25f7c29180b901b091089e3e52

SPY daily did reject and have one of the biggest gap downs we have had in a very long time. We continue to see buyers weaken to their weakest levels since 2/6/24 and we are impressively on the brink of losing extreme bull momentum now. 

The one thing that is incredibly bearish that happened today though is the fact that SPY lost its daily yellow bull support that dates back to 10/27 (the start of our bull run). 

We came down to take out previous supply at 490.84, however, we could not take out the daily 20ema support. Bulls will need to defend this critical support of 489.7 (projected) tomorrow if they want to repeat the previous 5 sell offs. This daily doji candle reminds me a lot of 1/17/24. 

Bears will look to use this window of weakness and selling to push SPY back down to previous demand and support of 482.88. 

Bulls need to defend support here at the daily 20ema support and look to retake and close back over the daily 8ema resistance of 495.1 (projected). 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 479.88 -> 501.15  
 Demand- 471.76 -> 482.88

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

I am going to show the macro zoom out channel here on ES since I showed the more zoomed in picture on Spy. As you can see the yellow bull channel that dates back to the bottom of this rally that started in October has been broken. The daily 20ema is critical support that will sit at 4935 for tomorrow. 

Bears will seek to drop through the daily 20ema support tomorrow and targets a bigger drop to 4871.

Bulls have to bounce here off daily 20ema support and then will begin to target a move back over the daily 8ema resistance of 4988 to be back in control. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVLES  
 Supply- 4836 -> 5043  
 Demand- 4871 -> 4961

**QQQ DAILY**

On QQQ here we also are breaking out of extreme daily bull momentum and bounce directly off daily 20ema support of 424.86. 

Bulls need to see buyers come back in and will look to defend daily 20ema support and retake daily 8ema resistance of 430.4 (projected). The bulls kept their bull run channel intact unlike SPY. 

Bears need to send this through the daily 20ema support tomorrow and target a bigger drop to the 416.96 demand from 1/31/24.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 437.19  
 Demand- 406.1 – 416.96

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

When we initially broke through 17701 on NQ I mentioned I thought this was an important enough level that we would backtest it and we finally did today. Bulls were not able to hold that critical support and now are back in the same 17264-17701 channel they traded in for almost 3 weeks before the most recent breakout. 

Bears need to break down the daily 20ema support of 17550 (projected) tomorrow and target a move back to that range support/ demand at 17264.

Bulls will look to bounce off the daily 20ema support and retake daily 8ema resistance of 17740 (projected). This would put them back over that critical 17701 level and target a move back to ATHs.

NQ FUTURES LEVELS  
 Supply- 17113 -> 18039  
 Demand- 16858 -> 17264

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/272gpov19fic1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a8163020a98c818bfa37e7d650b5a69d2d34544

I mentioned yesterday that I suspected we would see a lot of movement today on the 10YR yield and we officially broke out of the major double supply resistance at 4.188-4.207% and pumped all the way through to the 4.289% resistance level. 

The 10YR yield is sitting at its highest level since 12/1/23 when SPY traded at 459.1 at close. 

Outside of a major double top and rejection here on the 10YR yield tomorrow we should see some continuation with our upside targets being 4.353% and 4.41%. 

IF the bulls can reject the 10YR yield here we could see a move back to the consolidation range of 4.151-4.207% area.

The 10YR Yield is up almost 14% since December 27th. The last time the 10YR yield rose this much was September 1st to October 4th 2023 when SPY dropped 7.22% and then July 20th 2023 to August 21st 2023 when SPY dropped 5% during that time period. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.188 -> 4.207 -> 4.289 -> 4.353%  
 Demand- 4.151 -> 4.441 -> 4.522%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9d0op3b29fic1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab6a1f67544e457725e3ed6f879524f29656e7de

This is also the highest the dollar has been since November 14th when SPY closed at 448.73.

The dollar massively broke out and took out the double supply area of 104.158-104.446. Our next major target is the 105.086 demand and from there it’s a much larger breakout to 105.927-106.135 from the Octobers/ November lows. 

Bulls will look to double top the dollar tomorrow and send it back down to the 103.955-104.446 consolidation area. 

I still think its wild that DXY is up 4.33% since December 28th and the markets are still pushing up. The last time dollar rose this much was August 23rd 2023 to October 3rd 2023 and SPY dropped 5.35% during that time period. The only other time DXY has risen this much was February 2nd to March 8th 2023 when SPY dropped 9% during that time period. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.158 -> 104.446 -> 105.927  
 Demand- 103.955 -> 105.927

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v51gper29fic1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0c6dfe297ef5437a5f8bd56fe51d702b1812223

The VIX was very interesting to watch today… up until power hour we were looking at almost a 30% move on the VIX… something we have not seen (As mentioned above) in almost three years. However, per usual we got our massive PH pump and they crushed the VIX 15% in just over an hour. 

This is an interesting spot here because we broke through a few major trend lines today. We broke through the current red bull channel resistance that we have been holding under since 11/15/24. We also broke through and CLOSE over the daily quad supply of 14.36-15.31 which we have not closed a daily candle over since 11/9/23 and closed our highest daily level since 11/2/23. The VIX also broke through the yellow bear trend line that uses the low from 10/12/23 and 11/24/23 to form a projected resistance line that touches 10/23/23 candles high. 

This is a major snap of the down trend the VIX has been in for almost 4 months now. This actually appears to be a major cup and handle forming here on the daily time frame which could lead to a huge breakout on the VIX to 20.67-21.73 area. 

The VIX might get crushed again tomorrow which would put in a new supply at 15.86 and likely take out the previous quad supply. However after essentially three months of consolidation seeing the VIX finally breakout and breakout in a major way like today is incredibly interesting to watch. 

With the VIX, 10yr and DXY all in major breakout patterns here and ES/ NQ in a current dropping pattern bears as I mentioned have a window of opportunity to sell this market off in a big way (5-10% correction). However, if the bears do not capitalize on tomorrow to do it they are going to be left hanging high and dry again.

381,Exciting Expansion: Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. (TCEC.c) Initiates Winter 2024 Drill Program for South Falcon East Uranium Project (Article Summary),"Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. (Ticker: TCEC.c or TCEFF for US investors) has just announced its plans for a late winter 2024 drill program at the South Falcon East uranium project in the Athabasca Basin.

According to a recent research note from David Talbot, head of equity research at Red Cloud Securities, this drill program is a crucial step for Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. to earn a 75% interest in the British Columbia asset owned by Skyharbour Resources.

https://preview.redd.it/a4qr9yl8dfic1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddcb4236eb360317dfb8d380f7bc0ce377e57772

Tisdale's drill program aims to confirm and potentially expand upon historical resources previously identified by Skyharbour Resources in 2015.

These resources include a mineral estimate of 5,900,000 pounds of U3O8 at a 0.02% cutoff grade in the Fraser Lakes B uranium deposit. 

Multiple intervals of basement-hosted uranium mineralization were intersected. These findings suggest considerable potential for further discoveries within the project area.

The 1,500-meter drill program will also explore additional mineralized zones within the T-Bone Lake area. 

If successful, the drill program could not only confirm existing resources but also expand the overall resource base, providing exciting opportunities for investors.

Well yesterday a lot of people question my bulled up thesis and of course today for the 6th time over the last 4 months the bulls absolutely bought the dip and refused to let the bears have any sort of leverage. 

Listening to some of the fed speakers today it appears they were all “puzzled” by this inflation reading. I honestly think we just got a weird algo reaction to this data and now its business as normal for the bulls.

Yesterday I mentioned there has been 5 other times that we have played out this exact same movement… today now marks a 6th time that the bulls have refused to let the bears continue and take control. I said it before and I will say it again and again until something changes… there is just no reason to be short in this market and when its time to be short it will be very obvious (close below daily 20ema support AND a follow through close below it). 

However, one thing I will say about today (and honestly on the macro time frame the intraday movement isn’t super important) but todays movement was anything but bullish. Like usual the bulls put in all the work after hours when it was low volume. The bears did a really good job all the way through power hour rejecting breakouts and sending price action back to supports. I actually am impressed by the bears today. 

The following day after these recoveries have also been huge and bullish. 

11-13-23= -0.12%  
 12-8-23= 1.54%  
 12-22-23= 0.18%  
 1-19-24= 1.21%  
 2-2-24= 1.05%  
   
 

On average (not including the one time in November during the early stages of this run that we were red) we have rallied an additional 1% the following day.

Tomorrow is an incredibly data heavy day at 830am. I expect to see some sizeable pre market movement on this data. IF we continue to see jobless claims come in lower and retail sales are strong (which shows a stronger economy still) that would be hard to justify rate cuts right now and would further fuel the “panic” from Tuesdays CPI release. Could be an interesting day to watch play out. 

Looking above at the fed watch tool I don’t see much in the terms of this changing in the near future. However, we continue to price in the highest odds of the first rate cut being the June 2024 meeting and we are only pricing in four total rate cuts as of right now. If you remember JPOW said in Decembers fomc there would only be 75bps of rate cuts by EOY 24. I would not be surprised to see markets pullback even further on rate cut expectations. 

However, I honestly think that markets hold steady on these predictions and when we get the March FOMC meeting DOT Plot is when the fireworks happen. 

**SPY DAILY**

Looking at SPY daily here we are seeing our third doji in a row. The bulls were able to get back over the daily 8ema resistance which does put them back in control. However, we did not see daily buyers return and we did not put a new demand in. 

Bulls need to hold this 8ema support and look to push back to the 501.15 supply area to put in a new demand/ support and hopefully see buyers return. 

Bears still have an opportunity here honestly. If they are able to reject here they could play out a 123 rollercoaster lower. However, they will need likely the help of data to do this tomorrow morning. If they play this move out they will need to close below Tuesday low and below the daily 20ema support at 490.7 (projected). This is a pretty big ask to be honest but it still is a window of opportunity for them. Until a new demand is confirmed the bears have an opportunity. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 501.15  
 Demand- 482.88

Similar move here on ES in that we got the double bottom bounce and continue to hold 4961 demand/ support which is very bullish. It took all day long but finally by power hour we did see buyers return to the daily timeframe.

Bulls getting back over the daily 8ema resistance is very bullish and tomorrow they need to hold that as support and avoid a double top rejection right back under it. Bulls target is 5043 but will need daily buyers to come in and hold to support that target. 

Bears have an opportunity to reject here and double top us back under the daily 8ema support of 4994. If they can do that our target would be 4961 and bears would need minimally to close under that but ideally to close under 4944 (daily 20ema support projected). 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5043  
 Demand- 4961

Nearly identical setup here on QQQ compared to SPY in that we have three dojis in a row. However much like ES/ NQ we had new buyers come in during power hour. 

Bulls retook the daily 8ema resistance and are trying to hold that as support now. If bulls can defend that support and see buyers return we will target a move back to the 437.19 supply area. 

Bears on QQQ also have that window of weakness opportunity here where we could see a drop tomorrow after a failed recovery. We will need to see a major sell come in for that to happen though and this would be against the macro trend. Bears need to get back under daily 8ema support but honestly needs to be under previous candles low and daily 20ema support of 425.6 (daily 20ema projected). 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 437.19  
 Demand- 416.96

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

NQ looks very similar to ES in that we did not get a new demand but we did at the very end of the day see buyers return to the markets. 

Bulls retook (after a major intraday fight) the daily 8ema resistance and now need to push to previous supply of 18038 with daily buyers holding strong. 

Bears certainly have an opportunity to reject here and take this lower tomorrow with a double top if buyers can not hold over night. IF the bears take it lower they need to engulf todays candle and likely close under daily 20ema support of 17588 to have any sort of control here.

As I was suspecting for bulls to get the recovery today we needed to see the 10YR double top and it did just that. With a new daily supply at 4.318% here we have now built out a new double supply and resistance area of 4.318-4.353%.

If bears can not break through that double supply they are going to have a hard time going forward. 

Bulls will look to go all the way back down to previous double supply of 4.188-4.207% to push markets higher. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.188 -> 4.207 -> 4.318 -> 4.353%  
 Demand- 4.151- > 4.41%

Taking a look at DXY we also got the double top and rejection I was looking for but we did not see a new supply. 

The dollar could be building out its next daily bull flag here which would lead to a pop to the 105.086 area. However, if this becomes a new supply (likely tomorrow) and we reject lower the bulls will look to backtest the previous double supply resistance areas of 104.158-104.446 which should lead to a push up in markets. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.158 -> 104.446  
 Demand- 103.955 -> 105.086

**VIX DAILY**

Unsurprisingly here they completely crushed the VIX today. The vix actually had a ton of movement today (which is maybe why trading was so great today). I found it interesting that the VIX did not go back under daily 8ema support near 14.03 though. 

We did get a new daily supply at 15.85 which now extends our the essentially 4 month long range on VIX. 

IF the bulls want a breakout they likely will slam the VIX back into the 12-13 support/ demand area. However, if the daily 8ema support here in the 14s can hold and we bounce high enough to put in a new demand in this area we actually could see that leg down in the markets. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I had a great day today. I was just really feeling it and absolutely killed it. The only mistake I feel I made today was my first eval I only needed about 2k to pass the eval so I went heavy the first play looking for a breakout and unfortunately it didn’t breakout (until later) and I got stopped out. 

Honestly this was some of the best trading that I have seen on this market in weeks if not months. Price action was so pure today. 

I was able to pass an eval today which is perfect since we have one day pass on APEX right now. I will convert this to a PA tonight. 

I am about $500 away from passing my 2nd APEX eval and plan to do that tomorrow. I was going to attempt to push my luck EOD and pass it but I don’t do great after 2pm and I started to not like the price action as much. 

Overall just a killer day here. I did take a lot of super fast profits and plays today mostly because I was heavy 2-5 contracts if not more in a few plays and I needed to make sure I didn’t lose too much of my trail. 

Plan tomorrow is to pass this 2nd eval and then work on the third eval. 

I will likely not trade my PA until Monday. The reason being is that Friday is MOPEX (monthly options expiration) and I have almost ALWAYS had a bad time trading any sort of MOPEX day and im not going to risk a PA account on that. Starting Monday gives me 12 days of trading before I can request a payout.

393,Dolly Varden Silver Strikes Gold: Analysts Laud 'Bonanza-Grade' Discovery in BC's Golden Triangle,"Dolly Varden Silver's (Ticker: DV.v or DOLLF for US investors) latest exploration efforts at its Homestake Ridge property in British Columbia's Golden Triangle have unearthed what analysts are calling a ""bonanza-grade"" gold-rich zone, marking a significant milestone in the company's trajectory.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f1q0oficgmic1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=25862ae5fc057f490c1016a399ce6b79685ce772

The discovery of high-grade gold, includes impressive figures such as 79.49 grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) over 12.45 meters and 1,335 g/t Au over 0.68 meters. 

As highlighted in the Streetwise Reports article linked below, Marcus Giannini of Haywood Capital Markets believes that DV's new results compare favorably to the nearby Brucejack mine, which produces 300,000 oz of gold per year.

Additionally, the identification of a new high-grade zone northwest of the Homestake Silver Deposit hints at a broader gold trend within the region.

Beyond the immediate excitement of the gold strike, the Streetwise Reports article highlights how it is essential to consider Dolly Varden's broader strategy and the context of its recent acquisitions and partnerships. 

The company's acquisition of Homestake Ridge in 2022 not only diversified its portfolio but also positioned it well in both the silver and gold markets. 

Additionally, agreements such as the one with Libero Copper & Gold Corp. (LBC.v) for the Big Bulk copper-gold porphyry project highlight Dolly Varden's strategic vision and commitment to growth.

Looking ahead, Dolly Varden's upcoming catalysts, including its 2024 drilling program and mineral resource estimate for the Kitsault Valley project, are expected to further propel its trajectory.  CEO Shawn Khunkhun's emphasis on the importance of discovery underscores the company's focus on value creation for its shareholders.

In the eyes of industry experts like Chris Temple and Bob Moriarty, Dolly Varden emerges as a compelling investment opportunity. 

Temple's characterization of the company as an ""impressive"" precious metals player resonates with the sentiment shared by many observers. Moreover, Moriarty's endorsement of Kitsault Valley as a project with enormous potential speaks volumes about the long-term prospects of Dolly Varden.

395,Berkshire 13f “confidential treatment” position ,"
News came out today that Berkshire sold 1/3rd of its position in paramount global in Q4 last year and the stock dropped 7%+ after hours. Now with this news and potentially a huge drop tomorrow I’m going to be buying in and here’s why.

Ever since the Byron Allen offer of Paramount global PARA B shares traded to a huge discount compared to Para A shares and this discount has continued to grow. Why is this?  Two reasons 1. Selling of B shares to buy A shares for Voting rights on any potential buyout 2. Short sellers pushing to try to get anyone to sell so they can cover huge short positions without creating a squeeze for themselves. 

**1. Selling B shares to purchase A shares**
Para A shares have voting rights so anyone heavily invested in Para would like voting rights with many potential deals being offered right now. The evidence of this has been the growing discount of B shares to A shares since the Byron Allen offer. So who is doing this? Well what most people missed on the Berkshire 13f today was a position that received “confidential treatment” that Berkshire has been BUILDING. Any type of Non Disclosure Agreement would warrant a “confidential treatment” on the 13f filing. And we know that Skydance entered into a NDA with paramount in January. Given the wide and growing discount to the B shares to A shares it appears that is what Berkshire is doing to have voting power on their massive stake in paramount.

**2. Short sellers**
In most recent 13f filings we can see that short sellers have added to their positions. 70 mil short end of December. 78 mil short January 15th and now 83 mil short at end of January. Shorts sellers have many arguments against the stock but what they won’t tell you is they need to cover before any other kind of deal or offer is announced. So their strategy is to push to get people to sell so they can cover. Since the buyout announcement people are less willing to sell their shares, so how do you cover 80mil shares short if no one is willing to sell to you? Push it down and scare people into selling so you can cover. So what did they do today? They sold heavily after hours on Berkshire news when there’s low volume to be able to push it down drastically and stop people out tomorrow. There’s plenty more evidence of this with negative news articles, sudden price drops and increasing short interest. Don’t get fooled, nothing fundamentally has changed with this news that they are using to push the price down.

TL:DR I am Yolo’ing Para tomorrow, Berkshire is building a position in Para A to make sure they have a vote for their stake thus the confidential treatment for a position on their 13f filing today. Short sellers used after hours low volume to push price down. Time to load up. Not investment advice.

397,How does CBMJ's association with Donald Trump impact its appeal and what specific advantages does it bring to the company in the current political landscape?," 

CBMJ is garnering attention with its strategic business plan, focusing on establishing a conservative media alternative. Recent acquisitions, such as American Media Periscope and LTV Streaming, Inc., contribute significantly to CBMJ's growth trajectory.

The launch of PatriotTV, CBMJ's innovative platform, has gained momentum with the addition of renowned conservative media figure Brannon Howse. The appointment of retired General Michael J. Flynn to the CBMJ Board of Directors enhances credibility, leveraging his extensive experience in global intelligence, international affairs, and national security.

CBMJ's revenue model relies on recurring income from individual subscription fees and advertising revenues. This diversified income stream positions CBMJ for substantial growth in the next 18-24 months, particularly with PatriotTV's subscription-based streaming service and advertising opportunities.

The association with Donald Trump and the potential role of General Michael J. Flynn in a second Trump administration add a political dimension to CBMJ, enhancing its appeal amidst the current political landscape.

CBMJ's characteristics align with meme stock dynamics, reminiscent of the surge seen in DWAC, a Trump-related stock. With its conservative media approach and Trump connection, CBMJ presents an intriguing narrative for short-term traders looking to capitalize on market momentum.

Overall, CBMJ's potential as a speculative favorite among traders is bolstered by its alignment with political narratives, the appeal of PatriotTV, and its modest market capitalization, making it an attractive option for those seeking short-term trading opportunities.

405,$CAUD Collective Audience Is A Media Industry Game Changer; Its 47% February Rally Supports That Thesis ($CAUD)," 

Collective Audience, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAUD) is a media industry game-changer in many respects. And investors are taking notice, sending CAUD shares higher by over 47% since the start of February. However, while the run is indeed impressive, it’s likely the precursor to even higher gains, especially as CAUD continues to actively stake its claim in an audience-based performance advertising and ad-tech sector that’s expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next seven years.

The magnitude of how significant a trillion-dollar market potential is can’t be under-appreciated, particularly at a time when the once thought of as impossible mission to become a billionaire has been scored by an ever-growing number of people. Many professional investors thought that a company reaching the trillion-dollar market cap was a far stretch of optimism. But that’s been breached too, with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) all holding valuations closer to two trillion than one.

The interesting part of what’s happening in the investment world is that these valuations are being scored while everyone’s watching. The issue, however, is that many people and investors only see what they want to see and ignore, not always intentionally, the most monumental changes in global business and lifestyle landscapes.",1708020767,821552,StocksonHighAlertz,t2_crzn9izx,97038d1f30cc5c27351215889d8ab3e09633fb943db07474a84905c8072ea8ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1arlzm8/caud_collective_audience_is_a_media_industry_game/

After yesterday's major recovery we once again are seeing the bulls continue the trend into today. ES/ SPY has now come all the way back to the resistance/ supply area from Monday basically recovering the whole loss of Monday and Tuesday. NQ/ QQQ is slightly lagged behind as it appears non-tech is leading this drive back up. There once again was some major divergence on ES/ NQ today with NQ of course being the weaker of the two again. 

Tomorrow morning is another major data morning where we will get PPI at 830a and we also have MOPEX… for any of you that haven’t traded a MOPEX day just know they are volatile and vile. They can be very unpredictable with random movements at any time. 

&#x200B;

Looking at the PPI data for tomorrow morning the last three readings on PPI have been exactly 0% and not only that but they have been lower than forecast. The last higher than forecast came during Octobers reading. 

IF we see a reading over 0.0% and especially over 0.2% I would expect a sizeable drop on this data… however, if we can get a 0% reading or even a -0.1% or lower reading we likely could see our standard squeeze Friday that we are so accustomed to. Fridays have historically been so strong lately.

Taking look at SPY here the bulls were able to come all the way up to the previous supply/ resistance of 501.3 and were able to close over it today. With the closure over the range this looks like a sizeable bull flag breakout. 

The bulls put in a new demand at 496.79 today also. 

Bulls will look to push this through ATHs tomorrow and close the week on a big green note as we go into a three day weekend. 505-507.5 will be the bulls target tomorrow. 

Bears put up a really impressive fight today (especially on NQ) but just couldn’t hold us down at the end of the day. Bears minimally need to close back under the daily 8ema support and demand of 496.79 to be in control.

 Supply- 501.15

Just like SPY we were able to recover the whole two day drop and now are back over that critical supply/ resistance of 5043 which opens up an opportunity for a big breakout here. This looks like a really strong bull flag breakout. 

Bulls will continue to target ATHS with 5066-5080 as their upside target. 

Bears minimally need to close under 4974 demand to be back in control. However, the double demand/ support area of 4961-4974 is likely to hold strong on any sort of backtest.

QQQ daily buyers once again came in to support this upside move here, however they were not able to get us back over the previous supply/ resistance area of 437.1. 

QQQ/ NQ continues to lag slightly compared to ES/ Spy. 

Bulls turned daily 8ema into support today though and put in a new demand at 431.19. Bulls now need to target a breakout and closure over 437.1 supply to see new ATHs next week. 

Bears will need to minimally close under daily 8ema support and demand of 431.19 to be back in control.

NQ also put in a new demand at the previous double bottom of 17695 and saw buyers return to support the upside. 

With the daily 8 and 20ema support holding here on NQ we remain in our bullish upside movement here. 

Bulls need to push to 18039 and close over that supply/ resistance in order to breakout to a new ATHs next week. 

Bears need to minimally close under the daily demand of 17695 to have downside momentum. The bears had a really great failed breakout setup today until about 2pm when it finally broke out. It was one of the first times ive seen a daily double top/ rejection like that in a very long time.

The 10YR failed to breakout again today and came down far enough to break through the breakout channel. The daily 8ema at 4.203% remains key support here. 

With PPI data tomorrow we should expect a lot of movement with the 10YR and DXY once again. 

The bulls need to see the 10YR drop through the 4.151% demand area.

Bears want to see daily 8ema support hold and breakout back to the 4.318-4.353% double supply area. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS

Taking a look at DXY here we finally got the supply at 104.854 to match the one that the 10YR got yesterday. 

The daily 8ema support again holds here on DXY too at 104.306 area. 

Bulls need to see a cooler PPI to send DXY down to 103.995 demand. 

Bears want to see a hot PPI to send DXY up to the 104.854 and turn the daily 8ema into support again. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.854

Not a lot of movement here on the VIX today. The VIX is just holding onto daily 8ema support near 14 but cant quite do anything else. 

I do think it is interesting that the daily 8ema support continues to hold here and that the VIX hasn’t fully been crushed lower. However, the VIX has been getting crushed to the downside a lot lately.

Anyone familiar with this company.  Being on The public safety and Prehospital side of this world I think the company has great potential.

It is a POCUS (Pojnt of care ultra sound) they were brought public through a SPAC a few years back.  Its has highs and lows, here the last few months has been trading in the $1 range give or take a few cents.  Two days ago they just released a new probe and from what I have seen of it, it looks amazing for the specs.  If they can get pre hospital EMS services to buy into these, the sky will be the limit in my opinion, I think it will take some time but I’m long on the company and was wondering if anyone else was.

For the purpose of transparency I own a little over 10,000 shares and will be buying more as well.  I’m going long on this one as I think the technology will be adopted by EMS and be of major use in pre hospital settings for many various ailments that could help us make better choices for better outcomes.  For the price point and what it offers I feel like it will have a bright future.  They had some bumps in the road on inventory side but I think that has been cleaned up.  EC was expected March 5 2024 but they announced today Feb 28th EC after hours.  Investor inventory March 15th 2024.  


Figure I’d post and see if anyone else is investing and for those looking to invest, this could be a good long term play.  NFA

425,"HOT PPI… 2-16-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

After a hotter than forecast CPI send the markets scrambling on Tuesday the bulls tried to shake it off over the last two days. However, todays PPI print was just too much apparently for the market to fully shake off. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xhqr1tak0jc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=440f31010a42ba91341182867cb0cd34a2d5de57

CORE PPI M/M came in a 0.5% which is the hottest print in exactly a years time. After spending three back to back months unchanged we are seeing this major spike not only over previous but a massive 0.4% over forecast. 

PPI M/M also came in at the hottest level in the last 4 months with a major miss over previous (which was negative) and forecast too. 

The big deal here is the fact that CORE PPI inflation is now at 2% which is well above the 1.6% expected. Very hard to justify a fed pivot with these conditions. Many fed speakers are trying to explain away this bounce in January inflation by saying its seasonality and a one off event however, when the markets are trying to price in cuts it appears for now that they do not care about it being a one off event or not. 

&#x200B;

I do expect the probabilities to take another major change next week. However, expectations for rate cuts continue to pull back in a major way still. We are now barely (by 1.6%) pricing in 4 rate cuts in 2024. The first rate cuts highest does come in June still at 52.5%. I want to see how the markets not only react to fed minutes but also how they change their projections after CPI/ PPI and the minutes are all out there. 

That then sets markets up for about a month to go before the next CPI reading and FOMC meeting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/radxvzobk0jc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d84d4c7f7c3bc28cbe219020e0aeaff28e6119

Taking a look at next week we don’t have much on the agenda… however, markets are closed on Monday. Futures will trade till mid day and then reopen at 6pm like normal. Stock market and bond market will not open. This gives us a 4 day trading week next week. 

The big thing to focus on next week though is FOMC minutes on Wednesday. With the hotter than expected CPI and PPI leading into this we could see a pretty negative reaction to that on Wednesday. 

NVDA has earnings reporting on Wednesday after hours which with the way Semis are moving and all the wildness of this AI bubble can certainly move the markets in a major way. That also comes the night of FOMC minutes. I expect some major volatility on Thursday. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

For the first time in five weeks we are seeing weekly buyers weaken. We do however remain in extreme bull momentum here. With us remaining in extreme bull momentum I do suspect that the weekly 8ema support of 487.5 (projected) will continue to hold. This is also the second week in a row that 490 support has held us and bounced us. 

With a new weekly supply at 501.31 and weakened buyers the bears do have an opportunity to retest that weekly 8ema support of 487.5. I don’t expect with the extreme bull momentum that we actually break and hold under it. However, for everyone looking for their sign to short this market…. The first weekly close below 8ema support since October would be a pretty good sign to do it. 

Bulls are going to need an impressive move up here to retake 501.31 supply and put in a new demand. I mentioned briefly last week that volatility was rising and we are seeing the highest level of measured volatility on SPY since the week of 10/30/23 which of course was the bottom. This volatility is showing that the fight is getting harder for bulls here. 

I also noted this week (and some of last) that the bulls were struggling intraday more than usual.

Here on futures we actually got a really nice weekly double top doji candle here with a new supply at 5047. This doji candle here is actually the perfect signal to short on Es. With the buyers weakened and again volatility at the level it is the fight for bulls to push this higher might finally be growing enough to see a major correction. 

Bulls will look to defend weekly 8ema support of 4910 (projected). The bulls for the last two weeks have defended the 4930s very well and that also is major support to watch. 

IF the bears can close under weekly 8ema support we may be looking at our temporary top for a while.

Looking at QQQ here on the weekly we have a very solid double top rejection off the 437.21 supply and the weakest level of buying since 12/4/23.

Bears have a really big opportunity this week to send this below previous weekly demand/ support of 423.1. If they can close under that demand then we are looking at a pretty sizeable sell off as that would also put us below the weekly 8ema support. 

Bulls must defend 423.1 and look for a bigger breakout here on the daily back to 437.21 supply area. With NVDA reporting Wednesday and all the weakness we have seen on big tech this week (Compared to SPY) this could be a very interesting and highly volatile week for QQQ.

NQ also has a nice double top rejection off 18040 which makes that critical resistance for the bulls. Volatility relatively speaking here on QQQ and NQ actually has been falling steadily over the last few weeks. 

Bears need to use this window to close under 17460 demand and weekly 8ema support. IF that happens we could be looking at a more sizeable correction down to weekly 20ema. 

Bulls must defend 17460 here and weekly 8ema support.

I have been saying for the last month that the 10YR has also been in an uptrend and it just confirmed that this week with a major breakout over 4.161-4.244% double weekly supply. With this breakout here we are looking at a more sizeable move to 4.628% (next level of supply/ demand) if this trend holds. 

This channel that we are in here on the 10yr (in yellow) gives us a resistance level of 4.437% to watch for next week which is similar to the resistance of 11/20 and 11/27.

Bulls want to see the 10YR reject and end back near 4.032% in order to push higher. 

Bears are getting what they need here with this breakout on the 10yr and will look for continuation to the 4.628% demand area over the next month.

Now the dollar here actually is show a bit of a different trend here overall. DXY is actually showing more of a reversal lower (potential bear flag) here on the weekly. We have had back to back major doji rejections on the weekly timeframe and put in a new weekly supply at 104.144. Interestingly enough here we actually closed out a weekly imbalanced close though because DXY is closing over 104.144 supply that we put in this week. 

Bulls want to see this rejection continue to play out here which takes us back down under EMAs near 103.608 (weekly 8, 20 and 50ema all sitting on eachother). 

Bears need to see a hard bounce and hope to rebalance market by turning supply into demand next week.

Oil got a major bounce this week off the weekly 8/20ema supports. I am actually starting to see a failed bear flag/ cup and handle pattern form here which could lead to a pretty sizeable breakout here on oil over the next month or so. 

IF oil can punch through 78.31-80 double level resistance next week then we should have a pretty sizeable breakout to the mid to high 80s.

If these levels hold as they have for the last 3 months then oil likely heads back to the low 70s.

The VIX once again failed to breakout but also failed to lose its daily 20ema support. This mid to high 13 area is holding very nicely as support on the VIX once again. With FOMC minutes on Wednesday we could easily see some VIX movement once again. 

I truly am curious if after the CPI and PPI data if the markets are going to be more sensitive to the FOMC minutes than usual.

I had a pretty great week of trading I was able to pass two EVALs (I will convert one of them to a PA tonight for Tuesday to trade). 

I went into today needing about 2k more to pass my eval here and it was one heck of an up and down day. I actually decided outside of one play (which of course got wicked out) to play ES today instead of NQ. I recognized the wild movement of NQ (the sheer size of its intraday range) and that I would need to be nearly perfect to get a win. Versus ES which was moving sizeable but was still manageable. 

I missed my opportunity to pass intraday today as I sold that major sized long at 5049.5 and didn’t hold till my target of 5050.5 which would have been a pass. I just couldn’t find anything trustworthy and to close green on an OPEX day is hard enough I wasn’t going to risk giving it all back at all. One day pass on APEX lasts until Wednesday at 6pm so I just need to see about $350/ day and I pass. 

I truly am not in too big of a rush on that though as I already have two PAs and this would be a bonus.

My plan is to convert only one eval to a PA. 

Tuesday I will trade the PA and this eval together (So I can pass this eval). I will be eligible to take a payout between the 1st and 5th. This gives me 11 days to make $4600 which is about $418/ day. I plan to start consistent and work towards that. 

Once I take a payout the first week of march and pay my tuition I will start trading the 2nd PA. Take that payout and then add in the third PA. Take payout and then add more evals…

If I unfortunately lose the PA then I atleast have one back up PA ready to go. But that obviously is not the plan. 

I actually once again enjoyed trading ES today… especially considering it moved well. I might stick with that early next week. The biggest thing I noticed is that helped improve my trading this week was that I need to 1. Trade the bigger 15min trend and wait for that trend to take a play using critical support and resistance. I cant get too caught up in 5minute moves, 2. I need to be aggressive in entry. When I see the play happening I need to take it. I have snoozed far too many plays. And 3. Once I am in I need to let the play fully develop and hit profits.

441,Prelude of XR era in 2024: Samsung/ WiMi create their core competitive technology,"On January 19, Apple (AAPL) Vison Pro officially opened for pre-order. It is expected that apple’s 2024 Vision Pro total is about 400,000-500,000 units, while the first batch is about 80,000-100,000 units. Shortly after the pre-sale, Cook also posted a video at Twitter to celebrate the launch.

In addition, Apple is rapidly building a content ecosystem based on the product, and has released the latest Vision Pro guide videos, which show panoramic photos, spatial videos, siri assistant interaction, office, music listening, browser, video phone and other scenes and interactions.

**The XR era officially began**

The XR era has already begun. Apple’s first mixed reality MR device Vision Pro, MR means hybrid reality, is part of the XR terminal. Compared with VR virtual reality, MR further integrates the integration of virtual environment and real environment, and adds the integration of various virtual objects and images under the background of real environment.

Market research agencies say the $3,499 pricing suggests that Vision Pro is not for the average consumer, but for professional users and content developers. Although it is unlikely to have a disruptive impact on the consumer market in the short term, the industry and applications are expected to open up long-term growth space with the cost reduction of Vision Pro second generation products and the establishment of the overall software application ecosystem.

Ping An Securities said that Apple MR is expected to redefine the VR product experience and use scenarios, which will have a greater impact on the market and the industrial chain. Huatai Securities proposed that it has set up a new industry benchmark, and injected strong impetus into the development of the XR industry, or will guide the future development direction of the XR industry.

For enterprises, XR, as the entrance of the future world, is a competitive place for war. For users, the experience improvement brought by XR is all-round. At present, VR is mainly aimed at game scenes, and the penetration rate among game players is already very high. In the future, the greater opportunity for XR lies in the penetration of interaction, office, movie watching and other scenes.

**Samsung / WiMi have their own strength**

According to previous South Korean media reports, Samsung (SSNGY) plans to announce an XR headset, code-named “Infinite”, with the first production of 30,000 units. The U. S. Patent and Trademark Office revealed a new Samsung patent, which sees new technologies and ideas that could emerge on the next generation VR headset, which uses color and depth of field cameras to identify user gestures.

In addition, a Samsung patent called “Methods to Coordinating Mixed reality headsets with independent media devices” aims to synchronize media between devices and provide appropriate control for the headsets through a holographic user interface. The patent documents show that it is mainly displayed through a smart AR glasses. However, while Samsung doesn’t elaborate on the hardware, it looks like Samsung is intent on developing a device like Microsoft’s HoloLens.

At the same time, the data shows that the first holographic AR WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASAQ: WIMI) has vigorously developed XR all the year round, and developed and launched the next generation of industry-leading XR products to the market. The patent reserve and layout in the field of XR are among the best, so in the key link for consumer users, WiMi has made its own attempts in terms of service, technology, products and other aspects, showing the advanced XR entertainment experience, and will lead the future of XR.

In addition, WiMi brings together the industry leading advantage in the field of itself, continue to focus on AI and 5G blessing technology development, the combination of two technologies, make full use of the top 5G network resources can assign XR application and space computing scenarios, achieve both sides can accurately fusion and interaction with application, let more users can enter the virtual and reality of the new world, bring new immersive XR mixed reality experience.

**To sum up**

As a brand new industry and category, XR is not very familiar with most users. However, with the development of technology, this category has now come to the key node of breaking the circle, and in order to enter the ordinary people’s homes, the whole industry chain needs to make joint efforts. This is inseparable from the definition of the terminal factory at the hardware level, developers in the content ecosystem, as well as other startup companies betting.

On the whole, XR will burst out huge energy and broad space, but before the real volume of XR devices, in addition to the launch of the industry, Samsung and WiMi did not choose to miss this link, but with Apple to promote continuous contribution to expand the XR market. In short, the XR industry reform has arrived, it is suggested to pay sustainable attention to the change of industrial competition pattern and industrial trend.",1708333535,821112,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,96147768ee9a324a1ae5fabf47c1047d0f9a7ad02c75c4c8a43fc04e4074333e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1auizyb/prelude_of_xr_era_in_2024_samsung_wimi_create/

Alaska Energy Metals’ Nikolai project represents a promising opportunity as a substantial and dependable domestic source of nickel in support of the ongoing transition to cleaner energy. With a foundation of historical drilling data, there are compelling indications pointing to the presence of a significant nickel deposit, as well as the discovery of other valuable metals.

As progress continues with the initial drilling program, which is slated for completion by the fall of 2023, the primary objective is to establish an initial Inferred Resource estimate. Should the findings confirm the historical data, there is an anticipation that the resource could exceed a remarkable **one billion pounds of nickel** content. The aspiration is to reach this significant milestone by the spring of 2024

462,"High Tide inc , a winning choice for the long term"," I'll start with a screenshot from the last quarter :    

https://preview.redd.it/89wkur032sjc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b22ea0955b2edf812223a70fe69005805eae48c

 Last earnings call  : [https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/307349204/guest](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/307349204/guest) 

Continued progress on the Canadian front (by the government and   Health Canada) will help improve the sector for the companies operating   there and reduce the illicit market. These improvements, combined with   the continued decline in competition, will help expand High Tide's   market share.   

With the cannabis market declining last quarter (see photo below)   due to massive inflationary pressures weighing on consumers, I expect    slight increase for Hiti ( as a testament to the resilience of its   successful discount club model).   

https://preview.redd.it/g9f7rm352sjc1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e40d191835e45cc4370c84ca3054c9fe886c95

 With legalization expected in Germany in April, and a possible   rescheduling in the US, HITI is well positioned to capitalize on these   opportunities, thanks to its more than 5 millions global customer base.   This, combined with its ability to generate significant cash flow   despite currently low margins (expected to rise from Q3) makes it, in my   opinion, a winning long-term choice and the best among its  competitors.   

As mentioned in the call, margins will increase significantly in the   next year and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of  this:   

&#x200B;

* Constant growth in Elite membership (70% gross margin at current   membership price of $2.50/month, expected to return to $5), I estimate   they will exceed 100K by the end of the year (100k x5$/mounth =   500k/mounth + CCI + Fastlender technology license,  all 3 with > 80%   gross margin)     
 
* Resumption of seed sales in the US expected in Q2/Q3     
 
* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected in Q3     
 
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction   of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross   margins     
 
* Increase in white label products     
 
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q2/Q3     
 
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada     
 
* Profitability expected in Q4 will allow Hiti to have more fuel for growth and therefore to increase prices     
 

The constant addition of high-quality properties will ensure a   growing and constant flow of revenue. The fact that a store generates on   average 2.3X the revenue of its competitor is a testament to the   winning model that Hiti has.

 With only 163 stores, out of over 3600 currently present in Canada   (as of February 9, 2024) Hiti holds over 10% of the market share,   growing.   

Being a growth company, High Tide's valuation has been seriously   damaged (in addition to the overall decline of the cannabis sector since   2018) like many others, by the unprecedented rate increases by central   banks, which have compressed its multiples. With the change in  monetary  policy now imminent, we will see an expansion of multiples and  a  readjustment in the small cap growth sector. In addition to this,  there  is the continuous improvement of the company in every vertical in  which  it operates (with the exception of CBd e-commerce, damaged by  current  inflation, but expected to  strongly recover from Q3).   

Possible evaluations  and scenarios:   

&#x200B;

* If the US rescheduling happens I expect HITi to trade like its peers   at 3.4 p/s (High Tide currently trades at around 0.4).    **Bullish scenario (** 3.4 p/s \~ 2 Bln Marketcap **)**   
 
* No rescheduling and legalization in Germany this year, I expect High   Tide to trade 1 p/s by the end of the year, next one at the latest.     **Basic scenario (** 1 p/s \~ 600 Mln Marketcap)     
 

With profitability expected in Q4, I expect HITI to be added as a  position in several ETFs where it is not present now.   

High Tide has maintained exceptional performance in the Canadian   cannabis market. Even in the absence of full recreational legalization   in the U.S., the company continues to thrive in the northern market.   With over 10% market share in Canada , FCF+, over 500 million in rapidly   growing annual turnover, 1.3 million loyal members to its   cannacabanaclub and owner of the top 3 CBD companies globally, I   consider High tide inc  currently undervalued. The greatest wealth is   created by being an early investor.   

According to Wall Street analysts, High Tide is projected to achieve   profitability by fiscal 2025, with robust earnings growth anticipated   in the ensuing years. The consensus estimate for earnings per share   suggests a surge from 9 cents in 2025 to 64 cents in 2030   (conservative). This implies a forward price-earnings ratio of merely   2-times based on the 2030 earnings for a company that is attaining   double-digit growth. Even if High Tide merely achieves half of those   profit projections, its shares could easily double. Moreover, federal   legalization is likely to occur before 2030, presenting an additional   catalyst for multiple expansion.   

Besides its imminent profitability, High Tide’s revenue growth   remains robust. Revenue is anticipated to more than double from 2024 to   2028. Yet, the shares trade at a mere 0.37-times the 2024 sales   estimates (vs 3.6 of the sector), making them remarkably inexpensive   relative to the company’s growth prospects. It’s clear that this stock   possesses all the elements necessary for a remarkable turnaround rally   in the forthcoming years.

This market has a way of reminding us that “this time is different.” However, tomorrow is about to show us if it really is different this time or not…

we are looking at 6 of the last 10 opening red... and 4 of the last 6 opened red...

6 of the last 8 closed red too... 

Of the last 6 FOMC days only one time did we close lower than open/ higher than open... meaning generally IF we open red we will close below that level (more red) and if we open green we will close higher (more green) than that level.

What I think really matters though is what was said in those minutes and how markets will react to them now that they are in a more sensitive spot since CPI and PPI. JPOW was fairly hawkish at the last FOMC meeting and markets didn’t listen. I do think there is a fairly strong possibility that the markets are going to listen tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nc4dbd1tbtjc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=8939069602194aea8c89e1494a54ae8d7bf2c1af

Looking at the current fed funds rate projections you can see that we have a 91.5% odds that March has no rate cut and a 65.2% odds that May has no rate cut. I expect that to hold steady and potentially lock in even higher odds on May. What really is going to matter is what happens to the June and July rate cut odds. Currently markets believe there is a 53.7% odd that we cut first in June and do a total of four rate cuts in 2024. 

If you remember in December we were told that we should only expect three rate cuts total. With the hotter than expected CPI and way hotter than forecast and previous PPI… there is a really strong chance that tomorrow we could see a very bearish reaction to this data at 2pm. 

Something I find very interesting is the fact that on NQ it on average over the last 5 meetings has only pumped one time (133) points. The other 4 times it pushed up about 15 points. However, on average it drops almost 62 points after the minutes are released. 

**NVDA EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c7vu7zktbtjc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=28f0d5a6a11b5c2414bd15dcc02cc315cc0487ec

Taking a look at NVDA (doing a little early TA here as I think there is a lot riding on this earnings). Currently there is a 9.5% IV move priced in for NVDA meaning the MM are expecting a move to either the $750 area or $620 area. 

Based off the last four earnings here on NVDA (despite beating all four times) NVDA has only been green the day after earnings three times (technicaly two times because August 2023 we 0.1% green). Of the last four times NVDA is averaging a move of 10.24% meaning that we likely see a move over $750 or under $620. 

However, of the last 8  earnings we are seeing an EPS beat 6 of the last 8 times… with 5 of 8 times being green. The average move over the last 8 earnings is only 7.4% meaning we are unlikely to see a big enough reaction to warrant playing this earnings. 

Lets take a look at a few other companies like NVDA and how they have done this earnings season… 

 

https://preview.redd.it/i24gw1qubtjc1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cf9944198e184b8536b42cb5973ea9591b86589

Of 6 other companies that are “similar” to NVDA we have seen all 6 of these companies beat estimated EPS (AMD came in exactly as expected). Howeer, only three of the 6 have resulted in big green moves. TSM, AMAT and ASML are the only three that resulted in big green moves. INTC, AMD and QCOM all suffered red days as the result of their earnings despite solid EPS. 

This begs the question of is beating current EPS enough to warrant a big green day? And is it enough to warrant a major push pass the very high priced IV move? I don’t think it does. I think the risk certainly goes to the downside here as its not enough to beat EPS anymore… the way the market has SEMIs and NVDA priced is that it has to be better than perfect. A miss on EPS would be devestating and honeslty I can easily see after hours moving +/- 1% on NQ tomorrow night depending on what NVDA does. 

I am NOT playing earnings (I refuse to do that anymore) but this is one I certainly think is better left to play the momentum after not before. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fyvmco4vbtjc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=541548c58a726f3498ce4c5f6c73761921908a31

If you guys have been following me for a while you know I have posted this exact same image numerous times… 6 other times to be specific this exact same pattern has played out. This time though I actually believe its different. We not only have FOMC minutes to throw off the algos but if oyu look at the time and distance between the bounces this is officially the shortest retest fo the daily 20ema support during this entire october to present bull run. On average we were looking at the time it takes to retest the daily 20ema support after bouncing steadily dropping over the last few months. We went from averageing 28 days between touches (first two times) to averaging 14 days between touches to now from the previous touch only averaging 6 days (4 trading) between touches. 

Could this be the start of the correction bears have been waiting for? Looking at intraday price action for the last 2 weeks this is the strongest bears (sellers) have been this whole run up. Not only that but we are seeing daily sellers return on NQ and we now have one of the most anticipated earnings releases of the year (NVDA) on the same day as FOMC which comes after a hot CPI and PPI last week that turned the markets upside down temporarily. 

If the bears do not cease this opportunity tomorrow then we likely will continue to rally into Marchs CPI release and FOMC meeting. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hpktyenvbtjc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=19bb330da87e09de4a3cabbf82093cc28f365969

With our average 0.52% +/- move on SPY on the day of FOMC we should be looking at a potential close of 

Since putting in our reversal at 502 last week and getting a new supply we have still not seen the buyers come back in. The bears were able to not only take us under daily 8ema support but also under previous demand/ support of 496.79. 

Bears have an opportunity to start a longer multi-week correction but they are going to need to close under daily 20ema support of 493 (projected) minimally in order to start a leg down to previous demand of 482.88.

The bulls need to find support tomorrow to put in a new demand and minimally retake the daily 8ema resistance at 497.7 (projected) to then target a move back to 502.

SPY DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 502  
 Demand- 482.88 -> 496.79

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

ES put in the new supply on Friday at 5051 and started a sell off last night that last into mid day before the bulls started the recovery. Despite the bears effort they could not break through daily double demand of 4961/4974.

The bears need to likely see ES sellers come in and will need to close below 4961 demand/ daily 20ema support tomorrow in order to look for a bigger sustained drop to 4871 demand. 

The bulls have the perfect opportunity to bounce off this double demand support and turn it into a triple demand support. This would then retake the daily 8ema resistnace at 5006 (projected) and target a move back to 5051. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 5051  
 Demand- 4871 -> 4961 -> 4974

One thing on QQQ today that happened is that it lost the yellow bull channel support line. This effectively is the bull run support from october which ES/ SPY lost last week. 

With the daily 20ema support being breached here this is the prefect opportunity for the bears to seek an even bigger drop down to the daily 50ema support near 416.96 demand. However, this is a VERY strong doji (bullish) reversal here on QQQ much like what we saw on 1/17/24. 

The bulls need to hard bounce us tomorrow and retake the daily 8/20ema resistances of 426.6 and 430.5 (projected). If they can do that with buyers returning they will look for a move back to the double supply of 434.55-437.1.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 434.55 -> 437.1  
 Demand- 416.96 -> 431.19

NQ aslo has a very sizeable breakdown to lose its daily 20ema support today. It also for the first time since January 9th we saw daily sellers return to the market. 

The bears have a much bigger opportunity to drop us lower here with daily sellers coming in and breaking daily 20ema support. IF the bears can continue to have daily sellers there is a bigger target of daily 50ema support near 17200 (projected) which sits right near previous demand of 17264 from the bottom on January 31st. 

The bulls need to bring back in daily buyers and retake minimally 20ema resistance but ideally 8ema resistance near 17750 (projected) to be back in control. 17701 is another major pivot level that we have talked about numerous times over the last month. This is another major level that buls need to get back over to be back in control. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17133 -> 17958 -> 18038  
 Demand- 17264 -> 17701

There is a bit of a descrepency and some divergence here forming on the 10YR/ DXY comparing to the markets. The 10YR actually put in another supply today at 4.296% now making a triple supply/ resistnace area of 4.296-4.353%.

The daily 8ema support of 4.235%, however, continues to hold as well as previous demand of 4.226%.

Bulls need to break down under double demand support of 4.151-4.226%.

Bears need to break out over triple supply resistance of 4.296-4.353%. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.296 -> 4.318 -> 4.353%  
 Demand- 3.863 -> 4.151 -> 4.226%

The Dollar actually had even more divergence than 10YR did today with an even bigger drop. We are now under daily 8ema support on DXY but holding daily 20ema support of 103.92 and previous demand support of 103.955.

Bulls need to see a break down under daily 20ema support and target the 50ema support/ 103.541 supply. 

Bears need to find abounce here off demand and start a push back to supply at 104.854.

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.854  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 103.955 -> 105.086

The VIX has steadily for the last 3 months while markets rally making its way up higher and higher. Today we had a massive bounce on the VIX again to put in a new daily demand at 13.92. 

With this new demand and bounce right off daily 8/20ema support (remember I mentioned I was eyeing that Friday). We are looking at a potential breakout over the 15.85 supply from Tuesdays CPI day. IF we break out over that level then we can look at a bigger move back to the 20s. 

IF this 15.85 level can hold as resistance once again then bulls might have a stronger case to hold support and push back to ATHs. 

Tomorrows FOMC minutes certainly should move the VIX.

Today was a great day of trading. I had come into today with one PA, one EVAL already passed (not converted) and then a 2nd eval that was about $650 from passing. I am officially passed on the 2nd eval now. I still plan to not convert these to PAs right away. The EVALS will remain in a passed state and I will convert them upon next payout on here. 

I traded my PA for the first time today and have some great shorts. I would have absolutely loved to play the massive drop this morning but it just moved too fast and honestly it wasn’t MY A+ setup. The one thing I have realized in this market is that I have to and need to wait for my A+ setup. The times that I do not wait for MY A+ Setup and try to start playing every 5/15min candle is when I start taking bigger loses and more losses in a row. 

Todays first short I honestly wish I had just held it till my 2nd shorts close of 4983. However, as you see the play moved as expected but we got an unexpected bounce first that took my protection out. However, I am in a great place and I was content after my 2nd short to call it a day on my PA. 

Tomorrow is FOMC minutes and there are some days that are very unenjoyable to trade prior to minutes so I likely will tread lightly tomorrow.

Now, judging from the status of Apple (AAPL) AR / VR hybrid reality hardware products, the Vision Pro is about to officially launch, which is expected to push the VR / AR industry into a new phase. In recent years, Apple’s VR / AR layout has covered almost everything from patents, to acquisition of related companies to ARKit related development tools.

Take for example, last year, the planning and positioning of Apple MR related products were also spread, starting from VR helmet, and then launching AR glasses after the technology ecology is mature.

 

https://preview.redd.it/m42j9t1vbwjc1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=89db69a6ca5e3d5079ddae385e867fab37e1573a

**The potential of Apple’s AR / VR industry chain will emerge**

It is reported that Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman recently revealed the functions of Apple’s first virtual reality products can achieve, and Apple industrial design team is holding back a big move, after a few years AR technology is fully mature and related ecological improvement, directly launched light AR glasses, a blockbuster.

Previously, XR industry competition has been given priority to with VR, AR single line breakthrough, compared with the previous using VR devices will be enclosed immersed in the virtual world, MR is to break the boundary of VR and AR, the fusion, form a “mixed reality”, previous industry progress is not big, now apple’s products are a big step forward in this direction.

Compared with the products of Apple and Meta(META), it can be seen that Apple Vision Pro does not directly turn Zuckerberg into a virtual person like the latter. Instead, it first connects mobile Internet device applications, moves from mobile ecology to AR, and then switches from AR to VR, and finally realizes Cook’s spatial computing idea.

In addition, it is important to note that the hardware and software composition and content development direction of Apple’s VR / AR products are gradually emerging, while market participants are expecting Apple to launch Vision Pro devices. This is because the leading companies may redefine this new industry, which directly driving the outbreak of the industrial chain is the next step.

**Many manufacturers have entered the blue ocean**

In the changing trend of The Times, there are both the tactical callback of the pioneers, but also the active entry of new players. It is reported that Alibaba (BABA) launched a new brand “Future Spirit” in September, and simultaneously launched the future Spirit AR glasses. This is the original “Tmall wizard” driven by a big model of an upgrade. After the upgrade, the product line is also expanded from the previous single smart speaker to the AIGC terminal series including three products, including AR glasses.

Coincidentally, many manufacturers have jumped into the “virtual world” blue ocean, test the water.

**To sum up**

Market research firm TrendForce said Apple’s Apple Vision Pro is expected to stimulate new demand in the AR / VR product category. Apple’s entry into the MR space will be an exciting news. For years, VR, AR and XR circles have been waiting for a “game changer” blockbuster to enter and bring their apps into mass life.

Apple has been expected to change the world once again, including personal computers, digital players, mobile phones, tablets, watches and headphones. However, there is no denying that, in addition to Alibaba, WiMi Hologram Cloud and other industry leaders have also been standing in this budding field of good position.

475,CIPI: Navigating the Renewable Energy Landscape with Precision and Purpose,"&#x200B;

[Forecasted growth of the renewable energy market](https://preview.redd.it/z521expgvyjc1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=69a8947478eedf41dee04e7d253dc47f2838260c)

Amidst the bustling activity of the stock market, where each investor seeks to uncover the next big thing, Correlate Energy Corp (CIPI) emerges as a compelling play in the renewable energy space. Let’s dive into a company that's strategically positioned itself in a unique niche within the vast renewable energy sector. 

&#x200B;

**Strategic Focus on the Underserved**

While the industry giants have their sights set on large-scale utility projects, CIPI has carved out its niche among mid-sized commercial and industrial (C&I) clients. This focus addresses a notable gap in the market, bringing distributed, sustainable energy solutions to those previously overlooked. It's a thoughtful approach, recognizing the potential for substantial, reliable cash flows from projects others might bypass.

&#x200B;

**Riding the Solar Wave with a Mission**

The economics of solar power have dramatically shifted over the past decade. With costs tumbling and capacity soaring, CIPI's entry into the market is timely. The projected growth from 153 GW to 375 GW by 2028 in the U.S. solar capacity highlights a sector on the brink of significant expansion. CIPI aims not just to participate but to lead within its chosen niche by leveraging this growth trajectory for its innovative projects.

&#x200B;

**A Peek into the Financials and Future Growth**

The financial landscape for CIPI suggests a path of promising growth and potential profitability. Analysts from Harbinger Research spotlight the company's accelerating revenue growth amidst a robust project pipeline. This isn't about current profitability but about identifying a company with the vision and strategy to sustain and increase its market presence over time.

&#x200B;

**Expanding Horizons Beyond Solar**

CIPI's strategy extends well beyond solar projects. Their ventures into microgrids, including a significant partnership with eDGe Renewable Partners and a groundbreaking 40MW microgrid project, exemplify a broader vision for the future of energy. These initiatives are essential steps toward a future where renewable energy is integrated, accessible, and efficient across multiple sectors.

&#x200B;

**Why CIPI Stands Out**

\-Targeted Market Niche: CIPI's focus on mid-sized C&I markets taps into a demand for renewable solutions that's both underserved and ripe with opportunity. CIPI zeroes in on mid-size projects (think 5-20MW), while the big players focus on large utility-scale solar farms.

\- Solid Financial Trajectory: With revenues forecasted to surge from $4.16 million in Q2 2023 to an anticipated $45-$60 million in 2024, CIPI's financial outlook is promising.

\- Innovative Projects and Partnerships: From securing significant financing for key projects to embarking on strategic joint ventures, CIPI is actively shaping its future in the renewable energy landscape. It recently secured $11.9 million to develop a significant solar project in Pennsylvania and announced a joint venture with eDGe Renewable Partners.

\- Experienced Leadership: The depth of experience within CIPI's leadership team is a critical asset, guiding the company through complex market dynamics with a clear vision for growth.

&#x200B;

**A Forward-Thinking Perspective on Renewable Energy**

CIPI's approach to delivering clean energy solutions to the mid-market C&I sector is innovative and necessary. CIPI's mission aligns with broader environmental and economic goals in a world increasingly focused on sustainability.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Beyond Just Another Stock Pick**

CIPI represents a unique convergence of strategy, market positioning, and growth potential in the renewable energy sector. For investors and enthusiasts alike, it offers a glimpse into how targeted initiatives and forward-thinking leadership can pave the way for meaningful impact in the transition to clean energy.

As we look into the future, CIPI is a testament to the potential for thoughtful, strategic engagement with the renewable energy market. It's about investing in a company poised to play a significant role in shaping the future of energy.

481,"FOMC Minutes and NVDA Earnings Review… 2-21-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

I was asking yesterday if this time was different and up until power hour I was ready to confidently say yes this time was different. However, with that massive EOD squeeze it is clear this time is in fact not different. The bulls again remain in control. 

Lets take a look at the FOMC Minutes and some important highlights from that meeting (taken from various social media posts). 

· Fed Minutes: A couple of policymakers pointed to downside risks from maintaining an overly restrictive stance for too long.

· Most Fed policymakers noted risks of easing too quickly, emphasized importance of incoming data in judging if inflation is moving sustainably to 2%. 

· Fed officials judged policy rate likely at its peak for this cycle. 

· Staff economic outlook was slightly stronger than the December projection. 

· A few officials noted balance sheet runoff could continue after rate cuts begin. 

· Several policymakers emphasized importance of communicating clearly about data-dependent approach. 

· While risks to achieving dual-mandate goals were in better balance, officials said they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. 

· Policymakers generally noted they did not see it as appropriate to lower funds rate until gaining greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably toward 2%. 

· Some officials noted progress on inflation could stall. 

· Fed staff saw risks to the economic forecast skewed to the downside. 

· Noting reductions in overnight reverse repo usage many officials said it would be appropriate to start in depth balance sheet discussions at the next meeting. 

· Officials highlighted uncertainty around how long restrictive policy stance would be needed. 

· Some policymakers said slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff could help smooth transition to ample level of reserves, and could allow balance sheet runoff to continue for longer. 

· Fed Funds futures contracts continue to price in June as first Fed rate cut. 

My biggest take away here is that the Fed (remember this is from before the hotter CPI and PPI in January) is working under the assumption that inflation is still on a downward trajectory. I don’t think there is a base case ever for a rate HIKE unless some how inflation sky rockets. I do think in March we could see the fed pullback from its previous 75bps of cuts expectations. The fed does not have the confidence in inflation to begin cutting yet and the fed sees the economy as far too strong to need to justify early. We are still looking at a higher for longer stage here. Marchs meeting when we get the DOT Plot is going to be what moves this market in a major way. 

**NVDA** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cg7tw7p5c0kc1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=52eef8f4b6329c7418e2e7b91f9b507bca69b132

This was my suspicion is that we would have a beat on NVDA however it would still sell off like the other stocks. When you price things to perfection it is hard to pump… NVDA was up a few % before dumping 4% and as of writing this is trying to go green again. 

This doenst give us a definitely enough move here after hours for tomorrow. However, this is looking more like this time for the market is not different and we could get a nice squeeze tomorrow off the daily 20ema. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mzpee976c0kc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe8dec863ffc57afef9f70204a5b8cdbe3abb20

Surprisingly today despite a very strong bullish reversal candle on yesterdays close, up until power hour the bears were completely in control. We spent the whole day trading between the daily 8 ema and daily 20ema. 

The way I see this trend here is that bulls and bears have an equal shot. IF the bears close below daily 20ema support of 493.2 tomorrow then likely the correction down to low 480s is coming. 

If the bulls close us back over 497.11 daily 8ema resistance then likely its business as usual and we head back to ATHs. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502  
 Demand- 482.88 -> 496.79

Similar story here on ES in that we spent the whole day fighting inside the 8 and 20ema with the majority being trying to break under 20ema support. Despite all the bears efforts though they were not able to get through the daily 20ema support. 

Bulls need to reclaim 4997 (daily 8ema) in order to be back in control.

Bears need to close under this extremely strong daily 20ema support and 4961-4974 double demand. If they do then we likely will head back to 4870 area. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5051  
 Demand- 4871 -> 4961 -> 4974

We now have a full candle closed below the daily 20ema support for the first time since January 5th. 

Bulls will look to bounce here and retake daily 20ema resistance near 426.5 (projected) to then move back to daily 8ema resistance near 428.8 (projected). 

Bears have a major opportunity here to take this lower. IF they can hold here under daily 20ema with stronger daily sellers coming in our downside target would be 416.96 demand which is near the daily 50ema support. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 434.55 -> 437.1  
 Demand- 416.96 -> 431.19

Tech certainly was the laggard today and lead the downside most of the day compared to Es/ Spy. 

We had back to back days of stronger sellers on the daily for the first time since the first week of January. We also held and confirmed the daily 20ema as resistance and likely with a follow through red day tomorrow could see the daily 8/20ema bearishly cross under. 

Bulls need to retake the daily 8/20ema resistance near 17610 to be back in control. This doji candle certainly is a potential bullish reversal candle here.

Bears next major support is the 17264 demand from 1/31/24 to take out. IF they can break through that we have a potential for retest of the daily supply of 17133/ daily 50ema support. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY   
 Supply- 17133 -> 17958 -> 18038  
 Demand- 17264 -> 17701

I mentioned yesterday that bulls needed to break under 4.226% or bears wanted to see the 10yr break through triple supply of 4.296-4.353%. The bears have officially broken through two of the three supply levels and continue to hold daily 8ema as support. 

If the bulls can officially close over 4.353% then their next target is 4.41% demand and that would certainly result in a strong sell off in this market. 

We also put in a second daily demand today at 4.273%.

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.296 -> 4.318 -> 4.353%  
 Demand- 4.151 -> 4.226 -> 4.273 -> 4.41%

Now on DXY here we are still seeing that small divergence between 10yr and dxy. While 10yr is certainly on the move to the upside we are actually seeing DXY attempt to look weak. 

The bulls desperately need to break DXY under the daily 20ema support and daily demand of 103.955.

Bears will attempt to once again play the bull flag out and seek a move back to the previous supply level of 104.854.

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 103.541 -> 104.854  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 103.955 -> 105.086

The VIX has once again been made great… finally. The markets have absolutely been (intraday) moving perfectly with the VIX. 

The VIX continues to reject here at the 15.85 supply area. The bears are going to seek a closure over that level in order to start a more major correction in this market. 

If 15.85 continues to hold here then we likely have found the temporary bottom in our market.

I knew that today was likely going to be a very choppy day leading into FOMC minutes and especially with the highly anticipated NVDA earnings after hours. 

I was able to find a nice short this morning off the first failed breakout. From there I just sat cash as nothing looked good to me at all. They basically just slapped the price back and forth before FOMC minutes. After minutes I don’t usually enjoy trading that time frame and I didn’t see any sort of play that made sense for me so I just sat cash. 

Looking forward to likely regardless of what way market goes some solid movement on the back of NVDA earnings.

484,Root Insurance (ROOT) - Low float close to profitability w/ enormous potential,"Here's why I think Root Insurance (ticker: ROOT) might just be gearing up for a **NICE** short squeeze!

1. **Limited Tradable Shares**:  With only 4.02 million tradable shares out of 9.2 million outstanding,  the actual float available for trading is quite restricted. A  significant portion, 48%, is held by large institutions and funds,  tightening the available supply even further.
2. **High Short Interest**:  Short interest stands at a whopping 23.87%, nearing a million shares.  Given the low daily volume, the days to cover is at 8.3 days, signaling a  potential squeeze scenario.
3. **Healthy Financials**:  Root boasts about $500 million in unencumbered cash, generating  interest for the company. This financial flexibility virtually  eliminates bankruptcy concerns. Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,  further solidifying Root's stability.
4. **Operating Loss Improvement**:  Root achieved a remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,  decreasing from $48 million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This  substantial improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and  cost management initiatives undertaken by the company.
5. **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:  The net combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023. This  metric is crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the  relationship between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A  lower combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,  which suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are  effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.
6. **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:  Root experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which surged  by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year. This  robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer adoption and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings. Moreover, gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million, reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.
7. **Impressive Growth Metrics**:  In Q4 2023, Root demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%  improvement in operating loss compared to the previous year. The net  combined ratio improved significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting  profitability.
8. **Strategic Partnerships**:  Carvana, a major investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded insurance  tech to offer car insurance directly to consumers. With Carvana holding  3.14 million shares, their partnership bolsters Root's market presence.
9. **Expansion Plans**:  During today's earnings call, CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have  signed new embedded insurance partnerships in Q4, signaling further  growth potential.

Given  the near-term profitability and the long runway that this stock has, I  think this stock is severely undervalued at these prices and will go up.  I think if it caught enough attention, it has the potential to squeeze  pretty hard given the low float and high short interest.

490,"The Bears Fumbled At The One Yard Line Again… 2-22-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

I know a lot of people like to give me a hard time that I am a “perma-bear”, however I have been calling for at least 1.5 months now that “until the daily 20ema support on ES is lost and we hold a second candle under it that there is zero reason to be bearish long term.” I am by trade a technicalist so I enjoy finding the bull and bear case in each chart each day. There also is a bear case and a bull case and I enjoy presenting that to you guys so that you can make your own trades. 

Last night up until 3pm the bears had 1000% a chance. The best chance I have seen since October to actually drop this market and take it into a true 5-10% correction (which I have been saying is likely what continues this bull market even higher), however, we got absolutely squeezed to death during power hour and then rallied on NVDA after hours. The bears for the 7th time during this rally had the ball on the 1 yard and choked. This is by definition (and has been) a bull market. The daily 20ema support is clearly the line in the sand. 

Regardless of what my “bias” or thoughts on the day may be when im trading intraday I forget about all of that and only trade what the candles show me. 

Another thing I wanted to mention is that a day like today with a squeeze like this has a really big way of introducing FOMO and FOBLO. The one thing I will say about today is that just because today basically went straight up and you could have bought a long at open last night or open this morning and held it for some massive gains doesn’t mean its that simple. Trend days are the exception not the expectation in trading. These days can be a gift but can also be a nightmare to trade at times too. 

Don’t let a day like today where it did extreme things dictate your strategy or change your strategy. I can promise you the next time you “think” you see a day like this will be the day it does everything but this.

With todays MASSIVE move on NVDA it has officially added nearly 250billion in market cap… this takes the record that was set just 20 days ago by META for the single day largest market cap gain. 

NVDA needs about another 5% to join the 2 trillion market cap club of MSFT and APPLE.

This is the largest two day rally we have had since November 1st to November 3rd. This was also almost the bottom of the rally that led to this current four month long bull run. 

The 1st to 3rd rallied a total of 202 points or about 4.81% over three days. If this were to play out again we could see a move near 5160 area tomorrow. 

Honestly in my opinion the ONLY thing I see taking this market lower is CPI release and FOMC meeting middle of march. I don’t see any bearish catalysts going forward.

Whats really crazy is the other times that we have seen this a year later on average stocks were down 40%... (note- all these occurred during the dot com time). 

Something else that is interesting and show just how a few stocks are holding this market up is that the top 10% of stocks are at the highest level since 1931… 

A lot of people are comparting this rally to the dotcom and 2008 eras… and honestly the further we get into this bull market the more and more its hard to deny the similarities. But again until something breaks or the black swan arrives no reason to be Mr. Early for the downside. IF and WHEN the downside comes people wont be able to get in fast enough.

Truly a pretty incredible day here and incredible gap up on SPY. Not only did bulls retake the daily 8ema resistance and retake 502 supply (previously our top/ resistance)… but they managed to completely gap up over that and almost gap up to a open and hold at a new ATHs.

Bulls are obviously back in control and as I have mentioned until we close under that daily 20ema support and hold bulls remain in control. 

Our next target here is the yellow trend line of 509.72. After such a massive two day move on markets I would not be surprised to see some consolidation tomorrow. However, these squeeze days have a way of coming in pairs and much like the November three day rally we might have a little more to go tomorrow. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502

Es with an impressive and historical two day lod to hod rally. With a breakout through 5051 supply we are now at ATHs and we are back to price discovery mode. 

Bears will have very little control until we get a new daily supply put in at which time they can attempt a move back to the daily 8/20ema supports. With putting in a new daily demand at 4989 we have built out a massive triple demand/ support area that is going to take a lot of effort to break through. 

Bulls next target is the yellow trend line at 5125 and from there it’s a bigger breakout to the 5150 area. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5051  
 Demand- 4961 -> 4974 -> 4989

**QQQ DAILY**

This has got to be one of the biggest gap ups on QQQ I have ever seen. The bulls gapped this all the way up to the previous double supply/ resistance are of 434.55-437.1. with this massive gap up and closure over that double supply we should look for QQQ to seek out ATHs tomorrow and return to price discovery mode.

There is one thing I am watching that if you look at QQQ since 1/19/23 it has held a range of 416.96-437.1 and if you look at 1/24/24 (besides two days) it has held a range of 424.49-437.1.

With a breakout of this nearly month long range here we should see QQQ continue a much bigger breakout. However, I do see a potential case for a rejection here to put in a new supply/ upper resistance of our range. I am curious and keeping that option in the back of my mind going into tomorrow. 

Bulls next targets are ATHS and a bigger move to 442-445 area. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS

Despite such an incredibly push the last two days (really day + 1 hour) we did not see NQ hit a new ATHs. With a new demand at 17579 we should look for that to be critical support going forward. IF you look back to 2/2/24 that has been a support level that has been touched and held numerous times. the absolute last bit of bearish hopium is the fact that we did not close over 18038 today. We actually are closing directly at that double supply resistance. I would advise against betting for it to happen but we certainly could see a similar failed breakout like 2/15 to 2/16. 

Bulls need to close over 17958-18038 double supply and seek a move to ATHs with the bigger target being 18200-18300. 

Bears could certainly reject here at this double supply area and put in a new supply and lead to a new range resistance being put in. The target would be daily 8ema support near 17850 if they did that. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17958 -> 18038

Taking a look here at the 10YR yield we actually did not get a sell off on that today. Instead we pushed higher and further up into the triple supply resistance of 4.296-4.353%. 

With such a historical move up on markets today and yesterday I would have expected to see a bigger drop in the yields and DXY but instead they held steady. I have been talking for a bit now that I think banking could be our black swans. These rates staying higher and the results of some pretty major bond auctions are saying there is trouble in paradise. 

Bulls want to see the 10yr peak here and head back to 4.226-4.273% double demand support. 

Bears need to see a breakout officially over 4.353% and target 4.41% demand from a few months ago. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.296 -> 4.318 -> 4.353%

Similar move here on the dollar. Actually this massive doji here on the dollar is quite concerning for the markets in my opinion. Not only did we have a massive bounce off the already established trend line support but we reconfirmed previous demand of 103.961.

One concern I have here is that we actually closed imbalanced today (meaning we put in a demand/ support but closed under it instead of over it). 

Bulls need to dump this lower tomorrow in order to turn demand into support and seek a breakdown back to the daily 50ema support near 103.658.

Bears are looking to bounce here and close back over daily 8ema resistance of 104.124.

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.854  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 103.961 -> 105.086

The VIX despite a red day had a massive gap down and recovered a good portion of the gap. However, we now have this weird are on the VIX where we initially gapped up from 14.71-15.07 and then gapped down today from 15.22-14.64. Not too often do you see a gap up and then back down under a level. That will be an interesting level to watch going forward. 

The VIX is still holding daily 8/20ema support and holding previous demand of 13.92. The VIX much like the 10YR and DXY are not fully selling all is well and we can just blindly and comfortably buy longs. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I had a pretty great day of trading today (and over night). I found a new prop firm called MyFundedFutures (MFFU) that had a pretty amazing deal for its EVAL and FUNDED account so I went ahead and got one of those on special last night. Its kind of like APEX and Topstep had a baby with their rules being similar. I rode a long for 70pts from open until before I went to sleep. I had planned to ride the long for the full 3k but honestly I never expected a 411 point total move and I was worried about getting stop hunted. Ended up during opening hour taking some trades to pass that. 

With this new EVAL being passed I will now be up to four total PAs (three APEX and one MFFU). I do plan before the EOM to pick up two more of these evals on special so I can max out the three PAs for MFFU that im allowed. 

I will continue to work towards adding EVALS/ PAs on APEX after I get paid out beginning of march. 

After that I took one trade in my APEX PA account for a small 4 pt gain. 

Honestly massive trend days like this are my least favorite days to trade. I actually eyed every single 15min 5ema pullback and was looking for the bounces. However, the issue was that unless you basically bought right before the 15min candle closed immediately expecting a bounce you were left high and dry. 

I know my strategy and I have honed it in really nicely the last few weeks. Todays technicals and overall movement does not give me my ideal setup at all. I am content with the profits I have today and this week. There have been countless trend days like this where I would end up completely wrecked because I never expected the trend to continue. 

I do expect some solid movement tomorrow whether that comes in the form of a range or in the form of another trendy/ squeeze day. 

This has been a great week of trading and I look to continue that into tomorrow and next week.

Despite the short week of trading this week we actually had some pretty great movement up until today. Today was one of the only days with some tougher to trade technicals and an utter lack of movement for a few hours mid to end of day. 

I honestly was a little surprised by the mid morning sell off and then the failed recovery into EOD. Earlier in the week and last week when we had bearish days it was very clearly bearish technicals both intraday and on a macro scale. Today was not really as bearish as what played out. 

Honestly looking back today almost traded like an OPEX day in a way.

Taking a look at the agenda for next week there is technically a lot happening but honestly few of it I see as market moving enough to matter. GDP on Wednesday is something to keep your eyes on followed by PCE, PMI, personal spending/ income and jobless claims Thursday. We will finish the week out Friday with PMI and then most importantly UofM inflation expectations which lately has caused some very impressive movement.

The weekly timeframe here on SPY is honestly a bit of an oddity in my opinion. We had a very impressive bounce off the weekly 8ema support at 491.58 due to extreme bull momentum. 

However, the one thing that I am not seeing here despite a pretty strong and impressive bullish engulfing weekly candle is the fact that we did not see weekly buyers for the 2nd week in a row and we also did not get a new demand. 

Volatility (measured) on the weekly continues to rise here and has risen to the highest level since May 2022... The fight between buyers and sellers is growing each and every week. Eventually we are going to reach a tipping point one way or another. 

Bulls will look to break out to the top of our yellow bull channel resistance near 518 next week. While we do have extreme weekly bull momentum to continue pushing things higher we likely need to see weekly buyers return to properly support further upside. 

Bears will attempt to weekly double top us again and look for a move back under the 501.31 support area.

We have a similar setup here on ES. However a bit of a difference in structure in that we went from a double top last week to actually double bottoming and bullishly engulfing this week. 

5014 is now our new weekly demand and with our double bottom support there too we should look to that as ultimate bull support going forward. This pattern actually reminds me a lot of the 4733 demand and 4771 supply. 

We do remain in extreme bull momentum here on ES. 

Bulls will look to move us back to the top of this yellow bull channel resistance of 5215 next week. 

Bears will look to double top us and flush us back to the support area of 5014-5047.

Interestingly enough we could not hold higher enough to close over previous weekly supply of 437.21. Looking at the last 4-5 weeks on QQQ this looks like a textbook bull flag ready to breakout next week after this major weekly 8ema support bounce and new weekly demand. Realistically though QQQ has been ranging from 423.1-437.21 for 5 weeks now. 

The bulls have extreme momentum on their side on the weekly here too, however, much like QQQ did not see weekly buyers return to the markets. 

Bulls will look to break out to the red trend line resistance of 450 next week. 

Bears will attempt to immediately double top, form a new supply and attempt to push back to weekly 8ema support.

The weekly chart here on NQ has been barcoding for the third week in a row now. Bulls did not manage to close over 18040 which actually gives us a potential top here. 

If the bears can defend this 18040 supply on the weekly here this could lead to a move back to demand and support at 17460. 

Bears will look to play out a weekly double top and use the weakened buyers to drop this market back to 17460 demand/ support. IF they do that they will put in a new supply if not reconfirm current supply which would be very bearish and make 18040 an ultimate weekly and daily resistance level. 

Buyers need to break through 18040 and target a bigger breakout here off this weekly 8ema support test. If they breakout the target is the yellow and red resistance trend lines at 18630.

Taking a look at the 10YR Yield weekly chart here I still see a bigger bear flag in play. We did not get a new weekly supply, but we did get a nice weekly doji rejection. This week I have started to notice some increasing divergence between Markets and 10yr/ DXY. 

If this weekly bear flag plays out and we see the 10YR drop back under weekly 8/20ema support of 4.178% then that likely could lead to a more major breakout for the markets. 

Bulls need to see a closure under 4.178% next week. 

Bears will look to hold previous supply/ resistance of 4.161-4.244% as support and bounce back above 4.3%+ to attempt to take markets lower.

A similar story here on DXY in that this is attempting to play out as a bear flag but I am starting to see some divergences on a daily timeframe between markets and DXY. 

The bulls attempted to send the dollar crashing under the daily 8, 20 and 50ema supports at 103.682. Bulls need to close under that level next week in order to start the next rally higher. 

Bears couldn’t hold over 104.144 supply but were able to rebalance the markets this week. The bears will look this EMA bounce to hold support and push back over 104.144 next week.

Oil continues to consolidate and make no real progress one way or another. 

The bulls range oil all the way back to previous supply/ resistance of 78.26 but hard a hard rejection and double top off it. In doing so the bears were able to reconfirm 78.26 as a weekly supply and resistance. I do not expect much movement out of oil as for the last almost 3 months 78.26-80 has been resistance and 71-72.37 has been support. 

The weekly buyers once again did weaken here too. 

Bulls will need to push through 78.26 and likely through 80 in order to break oil out. 

Bears need to close under daily 8ema support of 75.84 in order to seek a bigger sell off down to 72.37 demand/ support.

Honestly today was a very tough day to trade. We had one of those massive pre market 8am-930am pushes that we used to get often that made it tough to trust a long at open. We finally made what looked like a retest of support during opening hour, however, support ended up completely failing and we had a sizeable sell off. I honestly didn’t think we would drop as far as we did as most of the candles throughout the drop said reversal higher not continuation lower. I was caught off guard there a little. 

I ended up finding the bottom but unfortunately missed a lot of points on my entry. I took a small win and exited just a little bit before it rejected and sold back off. After that the day was so mind numbingly slow and choppy it was hard to trust anything and I couldn’t find any play that was an A+ setup for me. 

With zero intentions of doing so I actually put in a perfect week trading a 100% win rate for the whole week. I am not sure the last time I have been able to do that. 

I was able to get my MFFU account set up and live for my PA today and took a trade in that with my APEX PA together. I am going to use both of those accounts together to trade as PAs. I have two other APEX PAs already passed and ready to go as backups. 

I made great progress this week on my APEX account and need 3400 more before March 5th. This gives me about $485/ day in order to meet my max goal and requirement before the payout window. I am in no rush and I will take $200/ day every day and do it in 20 days instead of shorter time period. The one thing that has always killed me with PAs is going too fast and over leveraged. I have really only been trading one contract and occasionally adding a second if I have high conviction. This has really allowed me to confidently enter a trade without being worried about the drawdown. I am still working on holding for some more major gains but this market is still a difficult one to trade and one I don’t trust fully all the time. 

I look forward to the weekend and then starting back up next week and continuing the strength into next week. 

I do think without data, and earnings next week we certainly might see some more choppy and consolidation like days. I don’t think they’ll be as painful as today but I don’t think we will see the explosive trend days either.

515,Retail investors among Fisker Inc.'s (NYSE:FSR) largest stockholders and were hit after last week's 19% price drop,"Key Insights

Significant control over Fisker by retail investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions

&#x200B;

44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders

&#x200B;

25% of Fisker is held by insiders

&#x200B;

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 53% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

&#x200B;

Following a 19% decrease in the stock price last week, retail investors suffered the most losses, but insiders who own 25% stock also took a hit.

&#x200B;

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Fisker, beginning with the chart below.

&#x200B;

See our latest analysis for Fisker

&#x200B;

ownership-breakdown

ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Fisker?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

&#x200B;

Fisker already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Fisker, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

&#x200B;

earnings-and-revenue-growth

earnings-and-revenue-growth

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Fisker. With a 12% stake, CEO Henrik Fisker is the largest shareholder. With 12% and 3.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Geeta Gupta-Fisker and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Interestingly, the second-largest shareholder, Geeta Gupta-Fisker is also Chief Financial Officer, again, pointing towards strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders.

&#x200B;

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

&#x200B;

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

&#x200B;

Insider Ownership Of Fisker

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

&#x200B;

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

&#x200B;

It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Fisker Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$316m, and insiders have US$80m worth of shares in their own names. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can click here to see if they have been buying or selling.

&#x200B;

General Public Ownership

The general public -- including retail investors -- own 53% of Fisker. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.

&#x200B;

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Fisker you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

&#x200B;

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

516,AGBA Celebrates Major Milestone with Successful Completion of Private Placement at a Premium to Market Price,"NASDAQ-listed, AGBA Group Holding Limited (“AGBA” or “the Company”), the leading one-stop financial supermarket in Hong Kong completed a private placement (the “PIPE”) of ordinary shares of the Company (the “Ordinary Shares”) and warrants (the “Warrants”) with an institutional investor, AGBA’s Group President, Mr. Wing-Fai Ng and AGBA’s management team.

The successful completion of the private placement is a significant milestone for AGBA.

The private placement was particularly noteworthy as it was executed at a price significantly above the market price of AGBA ordinary shares.

&#x200B;

Mr. Wing-Fai Ng, Group President, AGBA Group Holding Limited said “The successful completion of our private placement is an accomplishment that speaks volumes about the strength and potential of our business. The infusion of new capital at this opportune moment will put us in a supreme position to capture growth that we now see coming in 2024.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

NASDAQ has announced their Marketplace Services Platform for Voluntary Carbon Markets and Registries where these future Hydrogen Environmental Credits will most likely trade using NASDAQ's Services Platform. Based upon the previous volume of Carbon Credits for battery EVs, experts project Hydrogen Credits will provide billions of dollars of capital into companies such as RONN in order to further advance the de-carbonization agenda. According to Shell, Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg, in 2023 alone it is expected to be $1.7B - $2.0B for Voluntary Markets expanding to a projected $250 billion by 2050, with pricing per unit expanding from $.17 to upwards of $50 during the same period.

&#x200B;

523,Root (ROOT): More Fuel for the Ongoing Short Squeeze,"ROOT is up an impressive 100% since  the earnings report (ER) on Wednesday AH, and I believe this rally could  extend even further due to it's turnaround in its business and the  underlying market fundamentals.

Click here for my [First DD on fundamentals after earnings on Wed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1aws6wt/root_insurance_root_low_float_close_to/?share_id=7dNXghOSRn_czHJgpmc17)

Let's break down the numbers and why I think there's massive potential for a continued short squeeze:

* On Thursday, 2/22, 53% of 5.2 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.
* Following that, on Friday, 2/23, 52% of 2.2 million shares were sold short, amounting to around 1.14 million shares.
* It's important to note that there are only **4.02 million tradable shares out of 9.2 million outstanding.** Moreover, a significant chunk, **48%, is tightly held by large institutions and funds, further constraining the available supply.**

Now, let's make some assumptions:

* If  we conservatively estimate that 75% of shorts from Thursday have  covered their positions already, that leaves us with roughly 750,000  shares short that haven't been covered yet.
* Similarly,  assuming that 25% of shorts from Friday have already covered, we're  left with approximately 800,000 shares short that are yet to be covered.

**Combining  these figures, we're looking at approximately 1.55 million shares  short, representing a substantial 38 percentage of the total float.**

Given  the limited availability of shares for trading and the high short  interest, the stage is set for a significant short squeeze. As more  short sellers scramble to cover their positions, the buying pressure  could intensify, driving ROOT's stock price even higher.

With  such a high percentage of the float held by shorts, any positive  catalysts or buying pressure could trigger a rapid and explosive move  upward.

In fact, ROOT has received multiple price target increases since Wednesday. The latest one came  in this morning:

[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/keefe-bruyette--woods-upgrades-root-stock-to-outperform-on-improved-spending-efficiency-93CH-3315318](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/keefe-bruyette--woods-upgrades-root-stock-to-outperform-on-improved-spending-efficiency-93CH-3315318)

In  summary, ROOT's short squeeze potential is undeniable, and the current  setup suggests that the rally might just be getting started.

541,Root (ROOT) Short Squeeze: Continuing Again Today Due Its Unique Circumstances,"Go check out ROOT. It's squeezing yet  again after recovering from a 12% drop within the first 10 mins of open  today due to its unique set of circumstances behind the stock which  I'll explain below:

**1. Short Interest Surge:**

* Yesterday's short data revealed that the Short Volume stood at 641,672 shares, accounting for **36.86%** of the total reported  volume.
* On Thursday, 2/22, 53% of 5.2 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.
* Following that, on Friday, 2/23, 52% of 2.2 million shares were sold short, amounting to around 1.14 million shares.

Here's the math:

* If  we conservatively estimate that 90% of shorts from Thursday have  covered their positions already, that leaves us with roughly 10% of 2.75  million shares short, this equals 275,000 shares.
* Assuming  that 50% of shorts from Friday have already covered, we're left with  approximately 50% of 1.14 million shares short, this equals 570,000  shares.
* Similarly,  assuming that 25% of shorts from Monday have covered, we're left with  approximately 75% of the short interest. If the short volume was 641,672  shares, this equals 481,254 shares.

Therefore, the updated figures are:

* Thursday: 275,000 shares short
* Friday: 570,000 shares short
* Monday: 481,254 shares short

Short interest is at around **33.16%** based on my assumptions above. This number is probably much higher but I played it safe and used conservative figures.

>**The point here is that ALL of these short positions are now SEVERELY underwater and TRAPPED.**

They cannot get out by just sitting on the BID due to these several factors:

1. **Tiny float and low volume.**

* It's important to note that there are only **4.02 million tradable shares out of 9.2 million outstanding.** Moreover, a significant chunk, **48%, is tightly held by large institutions and funds, further constraining the available supply.**

**2. High bid-ask spread:**

* Go  take a look at the L2 of the stock. Bid-Ask spread is often 15 cents or  higher so shorts covering will dramatically affect the price

With  the low volume and limited tradable float, shorts are struggling to  find liquidity, exacerbating the volatility and driving prices higher.

The  shorts are essentially trapped in this and are ready to be squeezed  once they hit max pain point which we should be nearing soon. Once that  happens, I sincerely believe this stock could go up to $30+ within one  single trading day.

**3. Fundamental Strength of Root (ROOT):** Let's not forget the solid fundamentals backing ROOT's rally. Here's a quick recap from their recent earnings call:

* **Financial Stability**:  Root boasts a healthy balance sheet with about $500 million in  unencumbered cash, providing the company with ample liquidity to weather  storms and pursue growth opportunities.
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:  In Q4 2023, ROOT demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%  improvement in operating loss compared to the previous year. The  company's net combined ratio also improved significantly, reflecting  enhanced underwriting profitability.
* **Strategic Partnerships**:  During the earnings call, CEO Alex Timm hinted at new embedded  insurance partnerships in Q4, further expanding ROOT's market reach and  revenue potential.
* **Rejection of $19 Per Share Offer**:  Last July, Root received a $19 per share offer but turned it down. This  decision underscores the company's confidence in its turnaround  potential. With ROOT now in a much stronger position, trading levels  should reflect its improved fundamentals.

>In conclusion, Root (ROOT) is a powder keg waiting to explode.  
The  combination of trapped short sellers, fundamental strength, and market  dynamics sets the stage for unprecedented upside potential.

⚡️On the spot you trade cryptocurrency or tokens, which can be withdrawn to another exchange or wallet at will. When trading futures, you are trading cryptocurrency contracts and you can't withdraw anything until you close the trade. In some cases, exchanges may force you to close a position or force you to do it yourself, and at a disadvantage.

544,"Bull Flagging… 2-27-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

One thing that I found extremely interesting that has gone quietly unnoticed is the fact that only 4 of the last 11 trading days were green on ES and NQ… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q6x1ubwz07lc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea2cf545a4712a0173637b0f916c1b84ee250e0c

An even wilder stat that I saw is that anytime November, December, January and February is green there is a 100% probability that the next 12 months ends green… what is even crazier is the fact that of those 14 other times we are averaging a 17.4% pump over the next one year. From todays high that could put SPY at almost $595 by Q1 2025. 

Even looking at march on average only 2 of the 14 times did we close green and the max drawdown was 1.6% total. 

There still is absolutely no reason to expect a bear market, and there is still no reason to expect each and every pullback to be anything but the best dip buying opportunity. 

&#x200B;

The daily buyers continued to weak today, however, despite that weakness the bears once again could not take price down below the daily 8ema support. 

We did not get a new supply (barely) today either so we are a bit stuck here.

We have a really nice daily bull flag with support bounce off the 8ema playing out here right now too. I would not be surprised to see a fairly large breakout tomorrow. 

Bulls will look to hold this 8ema support bounce and see a move back to ATHs of 510.13.

Bears with weaker buyers still could take this lower and take this under the daily 8ema support of 503.45 (projected) and target previous supply of 502.

On Es we also did not see new daily buyers today but we were able to double bottom and bounce off daily 8ema support to put in a new demand at 5077.

This EOD squeeze that we had reminds me a lot of last Wednesday which led to a squeeze the next day. 

The bull flag is also in play here and if we breakout of 5095 triple top resistance/ supply tomorrow the bulls will begin go target a new ATHs at 5123.5.

Bears need to immediately double top tomorrow and reject 5095 triple top. If they can close under daily 8ema support of 5058 (projected) and target 5051 supply there is a window of opportunity for a drop.

Bit on an interesting day here on QQQ and NQ with something I have never seen before. On QQQ we actually had daily sellers for the first time since January 31st. However, on NQ we actually had stronger buyers come in today. I have never seen QQQ and NQ diverge like that before. 

No new supply here but daily 8ema support of 434.55 (projected) which sits perfectly with previous supply held very well on our retest today. 

Bulls need to seek a move up to ATHs of 440.59 with new daily buyers. 

Bears need to get back under 434.55/437.1 double supply and seek a move back to possibly the daily 20ema support of 430.3 (projected).

As I mentioned NQ did see stronger daily buyers come in today and also bounced off that daily 8ema support of 17900. NQ has been pinned here for the last two trading days now and with buyers coming back in I actually do think bulls finally will break this 18038 resistance tomorrow. 

Bulls will need to close well over 18038 and target ATHs of 18144.75.

Bears need to hold this 18038 supply level and close under daily 8ema support of 17900 (projected) minimally tomorrow.

The 10Yr Yield continues to chop and continues to do a whole lot of nothing. 

The 10YR has effectively ranged from 4.226% to 4.353% for the last 10 days. And for the last 16 days the 10YR has ranged from 4.089% to 4.353%. 

Bulls need to send this under triple demand/ support of 4.151-4.244%.

Bears need to break out over double supply of 4.337-4.353%.

On DXY here we did turn previous demand of 103.967 into supply. However, we immediately bounced and put in a new demand at 103.775.

We are for the last four days stuck inside this 103.775-103.967 range. 

Bulls need to break back under 103.775 demand and target a move back to 103.026.

Bears need to use this support bounce to target 103.967 and breakout back to the 104-105 area.

Another green day of trading here. I actually took my first red trade in 6 days of trading. However, was able to recover the losses and get some profits still.

Today was a bit of an oddity as we were in a very clear downtrend and just riding EMA resistance down like we have for the last week or so. However, at about 130 we found some impressive support and went on a very impressive squeeze. 

The last two days of trading have been brutal honestly. Just straight chop and tiny ranges. I am happy and very content to close day green even though I would have liked to obviously see much more green than that. 

As I mentioned numerous times slow and steady wins the race here for these PAs and EVALs. I am in absolutely zero rush.

550,Root (ROOT) Short Squeeze Resilience,"ROOT has been on an incredible surge since its earnings report last Wednesday AH, soaring from $7 to $25.

Some might speculate that there might be a pullback soon, but I argue otherwise.

Here's why ROOT could climb even higher to $30 by week's end through mini short squeezes:

**The Numbers:**

* Today's short data revealed that the Short Volume stood at 491,415 shares, accounting for **56.31%** of today's total reported volume.
* Monday's short data revealed that the Short Volume stood at 641,672 shares, accounting for **36.86%** of the total reported volume.
* Last Friday, 2/23, **52%** of 2.2 million shares were sold short, amounting to around 1.14 million shares.
* Last Thursday, 2/22, **53%** of 5.2 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.

**Math for Trapped Shorts:**

* Thursday: 275,000 shares short (conservatively assuming 90% have covered)
* Friday: 285,000 shares short (conservatively assuming 70% have covered)
* Monday: 384,994 shares short (conservatively assuming 40% have covered)
* Tuesday: 49,141 shares short (conservatively assuming 10% have covered)

Total shares short = 994,135 shares

>Short interest is estimated at around **24%**, suggesting that these short positions are now **severely underwater** and **trapped.**  
>  
>  
And the actual figures are probably higher as I used conservative numbers to come up with these assumptions.

**Market Dynamics:**

ROOT closed Tuesday at **$25.28**, near its daily high.

Trapped shorts are desperate for a price drop to cover their positions, but face significant challenges:

* **Tiny tradable float and low volume:** Only **4.02 million** tradable shares out of 9.2 million outstanding. Moreover, a significant chunk, **48%**, is tightly held by large institutions and funds, further constraining the available supply.
* **High bid-ask spread:**  Shorts covering will dramatically impact the price. Go take a look at  the L2 of the stock. Bid-Ask spread is often 15 cents or higher so  shorts covering will dramatically impact the price

**Analysis:**

>Shorts are essentially trapped in this.  
>  
>  
They  are praying for a sell-off so that they can cover without losing too  much money, but this just isn't happening due to the tiny float and low  liquidity.  
>  
>  
I believe that they will continue to be squeezed.  
>  
>  
Any  drop in price will shoot back up quickly because shorts will fight each  other to get out while they still can. We saw this happen in the first  15 minutes of today's opening when the stock dropped 12% on low volume  but shot back up to 10%+ within 30 mins.  
>  
>  
**This price action is a huge indication of shorts fighting each other to get out when they get a chance.**

**Prediction:**

>Right  now, based on today's price action, I believe that $25 will be the big  resistance, but if this goes above that, then we will see mini short  squeezes all the way up to **$30 and possibly beyond by END OF THIS WEEK.**  
>  
>  
This  dynamic creates an intense battle between short sellers and buyers,  with short sellers desperately trying to cover their positions while  buyers capitalize on the upward momentum.  
>  
>  
As the struggle intensifies, the potential for rapid price movements increases, further fueling the short squeeze narrative.

&#x200B;

[1  Hour Chart - you can see that it closed at $25.28 on Tuesday which is  close to high of day meaning that ALL SHORT positions are underwater](https://preview.redd.it/yaityweck9lc1.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=52829975240cc9b5cb965f60bdb44c8ea5d6dc44)

**Fundamental Strength of ROOT:**

ROOT's fundamentals add weight to its rally:

* **Business Turnaround:** Company has turned its business around and is basically at break even point and will be profitable soon
* **Healthy Financials**:   Root boasts about $500 million in unencumbered cash, generating   interest for the company. This financial flexibility virtually   eliminates bankruptcy concerns. Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,   further solidifying Root's stability.
* **Operating Loss Improvement**:   Root achieved a remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,   decreasing from $48 million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This   substantial improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and   cost management initiatives undertaken by the company.
* **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:   The net combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023. This   metric is crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the   relationship between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A   lower combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,   which suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are   effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.
* **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:   Root experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which  surged  by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year.  This  robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer  adoption and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings.  Moreover, gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million,  reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:   In Q4 2023, Root demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%   improvement in operating loss compared to the previous year. The net   combined ratio improved significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting   profitability.
* **Strategic Partnerships**:   Carvana, a major investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded insurance   tech to offer car insurance directly to consumers. With Carvana  holding  3.14 million shares, their partnership bolsters Root's market  presence.
* **Expansion Plans**:   During today's earnings call, CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have   signed new embedded insurance partnerships in Q4, signaling further   growth potential.

>**In  conclusion, ROOT is poised for unprecedented upside potential fueled by  trapped short sellers, robust fundamentals, and market dynamics**

568,"Consolidation Continues… 2-28-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Note- friendly reminder again I will be leaving mid morning/ afternoon on Friday. I will not have a weekly TA up this weekend as we are going out of state for a gymnastics competition and wont be back to very late Sunday night. 

After a slightly red but moot reaction to GDP this morning this market has once again found itself stuck inside the same four day range. Bulls certainly had far more strength today than we have seen, however, bears still showed a solid amount of fight.

Tomorrow morning we will get PCE and jobless data which should also provide some volatility and movement. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a decent breakout or breakdown tomorrow after so much consolidation. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n54pgrcxdelc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc1160cb70e97f1ade4b6c92263e47f70586f96c

With CPI only about two weeks out markets are still sensitive after the last CPI and PPI readings came in hot. A hotter than exepcted PCE reading certainly could send this market lower tomorrow. The biggest thing I am seeing here is that for the last year 0.1-0.2 has been a major “support” area here for PCE MoM. With back to back bounces and a forecast of 0.4% for this PCE and almost every reading coming in at forecast… if we get a 0.4% PCE reading at 830am we very well might see a strong sell off on the marekts tomorrow morning. 

This would short CPI, PPI and PCE all on the rise. Markets will have a tough time shaking that off. However, in the off chance we get a 0.2% PCE tomorrow we very well might see a bounce squeeze to the upside. 

&#x200B;

CORE PCE Annual change also is set to release tomorrow with that Mom data… right now for the last 12 months straight we have seen PCE unwind. Currently consensus shows an unchanged PCE… If that misses to the upside and we see a higher than previous PCE Annual change that goes with CPI and PPIs hotter than expected/ previous we are looking at a major downside reaction tomorrow before markets open.

We have some straight ugly candle structure and movement here on the daily. The bulls completely despite stronger buyers today failed to breakout and actually due to the gap down couldn’t even break yesterdays HOD. 

The daily 8ema continues to hold strongly as support though at 504.1.

Bears need to dump through 8ema nad close under 502 minimally to be in control. 

Bulls need to bounce back tomorrow with stronge buyers, a new demand and closure over 507.03 supply to target ATHs.

 Supply- 502 -> 507.03  
 Demand- 495.38

Looking at ES here we also got a new daily supply at 5091. We now have a very tight double supply/ resistance form 5091-5095. We did not see buyers come back in today and we also did not manage to close under daily 8ema support. The chop continues here. 

Bulls need to put in a new demand, have buyers come back in and close well over daily double supply of 5091-5095. 

Bears need to use this weakness here to close under daily 8ema support of 5063. If they can do that the target will be 5051. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5051 -> 5091 -> 5095

We continue to see a weird divergence and phenomenon here on QQQ/ NQ that I have never seen before. On QQQ daily we have back to back days of stronger selling. However, on NQ we still are showing daily buyers (though they weakened today). I have never seen back to back days of divergence like that. 

We got a new supply at 437.83 today on QQQ but once again could not get under daily 8ema support. 

Bulls need to close over 437.83 supply and see daily buyers return to the market here. 

Bears have an opportunity to send this to the daily 20ema support near 430.75 (projected) if sellers can hold and PCE data warrants it. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 437.83  
 Demand- 424.49

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

We did see daily buyers here on NQ finally weaken and that led to a new supply being put in at 18016. This now makes a major double support resistance area of 18016-18038.

The bears still could not close us under daily 8ema support despite the bearish engulfing candle. 

Bulls need to find support, buyers and a new demand to then break through and close over double supply of 18016-18038.

Bears have the opportunity to backtest daily 20ema support near 17770 (projected) if they can get through this tough 8ema support. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18016 -> 18038

The 10YR also rejected its breakout to the upside today now putting in another supply at 4.315%. 

We once again remain in a range here of triple demand/ support of 4.151-4.244% and triple supply/ resistance of 4.315-4.353%.

Bears need to close over 4.353% and bulls need to close under 4.151%.

We should expect a fairly large move on yields tomorrow with PCE data drop. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.315 -> 4.337 -> 4.353%

The dollar had a major failed breakout today and perfect rejected off the 103.967 supply (that was just turned from demand to supply) today. We remain for 5 trading days now sandwhiched inside this 103.775 demand to 103.967 supply area. 

Bulls need to close under 103.775 and bears need to close over 103.967.

I also expect DXY to see a large move based on PCE tomorrow. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 1036.967 -> 104.854

I ended up only putting in a small green day today. I had a great opening short off ORB/ resistance that I played for 6 points. I ended up around 1245-115 during that sell off and recovery getting burnt. I was looking for the massive bounce off ORB support to recover back to HOD. Took a long and of course got stopped on a fake breakdown which also I bit onto with a short that also got stopped. Thankfully took a long to ride back near HOD to recover some of my losses and close out green still. 

All in all a good day on the slow/ steady train to profits and payouts. 

I do expect some decent movement tomorrow with PCE data. The markets have been fairly pinned for four days now. We should either tomorrow or Friday get a lot of decent movement to play.

570,Exploring Tisdale Clean Energy's Strategic Direction in the Uranium Bull Run (CEO Video Breakdown),"In a recent interview on CEO.ca, Alex Klenman, CEO & Director of Tisdale Clean Energy (Ticker: TCEC.c or TCEFF for US investors), provided insights into the company's exploration strategy amidst the current uranium bull run. With Tisdale focused on acquiring and exploring uranium projects, Klenman shed light on the company's approach and its significance in 2024.

One key aspect highlighted by Klenman is Tisdale's unique positioning with a modest capital structure and a strategic focus on development rather than high-risk exploration. He emphasized the company's foundation of 29 million shares and no capital raised below 18 cents, underscoring a strong capital structure for potential growth. 

By acquiring South Falcon East Uranium, a project with a historic resource, and securing a deal with Skyharbour Resources (SYH.v), TCEC aims to fast-track development, capitalizing on the potential of a high-grade zone within the project.

https://preview.redd.it/ygl7vzt60flc1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=476fbe10410b5d497d217d5adb8f2e2d1996941a

The discussion extended to Tisdale's Phase 1 drill program, a critical milestone to meet earn-in obligations with SYH and initiate exploration efforts. Klenman outlined the program's significance in establishing Tisdale's credibility and valuation, with hopes of attracting institutional support for future drill programs. 

In distinguishing Tisdale from other players in the uranium exploration space, Klenman highlighted the company's lean structure, experienced team led by geologist Trevor Perkins, and a strategic focus on project development rather than lengthy exploration phases. This approach aligns with Tisdale's goal to leverage the uranium bull run effectively while minimizing risks associated with traditional exploration ventures.

Regarding the broader uranium market dynamics, Klenman emphasized the potential for uranium prices to continue rising, presenting a favorable backdrop for explorers like TCEC to capitalize on the market momentum.

Looking ahead, Klenman outlined Tisdale's roadmap, which includes increasing company visibility, executing drill programs, and pursuing fundraising efforts to support future exploration initiatives. 

With a supportive partnership with SYH and favorable project conditions, TCEC aims to maximize its drilling activities and advance its development goals throughout 2024.

573,ROOT Squeeze: Shorts Reaching Capitulation Point,"ROOT has witnessed an incredible surge from **$7 to $28** within one week.

While bulls celebrate, shorts find themselves in a **grim predicament, trapped and underwater** amidst this rapid ascent that seems never ending.

While  some may argue that this surge is excessive, I've held a contrary view  since last Wednesday, following ROOT's exceptional earnings call.

The call underscored a **pivotal turnaround**  in their once-struggling business, now on the cusp of profitability.  This transformation, from a break-even entity to one with promising  growth prospects, has been a testament to **ROOT's resilience and strategic vision.**

In my analysis, we are fast approaching a **critical juncture** for short positions, where the **pain threshold** is nearing its **capitulation point.**

The  influx of long positions, spurred by ROOT's stellar earnings reports  and a succession of mini-short squeezes, has laid the groundwork for  what I anticipate will be a monumental event: **the grand short squeeze.**

**Why ROOT Could Surge Further:**

The short interest in ROOT paints a compelling picture:

* Last Thursday, 2/22, **53%** of 5.2 million shares were sold short,  totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.
* Last Friday, 2/23, **52%** of 2.2 million shares were sold short,  amounting to around 1.14 million shares.
* Monday's short data revealed that the Short Volume stood at 641,672  shares, accounting for **36.86%** of the total reported volume.
* Tuesday's short data revealed that the Short Volume stood at 491,415  shares, accounting for **56.31%** of today's total reported volume.
* Wednesday's Short Volume is 291,972, which is **51.13%** of today's total   reported volume. Over the past 30 days, the average Short Volume has  been 49.68%.

**Math for Trapped Shorts:**

* Last Thursday: Approximately 137,500 shares short (conservatively assuming 95% have covered out of 2.75m).
* Last Friday: About 228,000 shares short (conservatively assuming 80% have covered out of 1.14m).
* Monday: Around 320,836 shares short (conservatively assuming 50% have covered out of 641,672).
* Tuesday: Roughly 122,834 shares short (conservatively assuming 25% have covered out of 491,415).
* Wednesday: Estimated 29,197 shares short (assuming 10% have covered out of 291,972).

**Total Shares Short:**

>The combined short interest across these days amounts to **838,367 shares or around 20%**.  
Note that the actual figures are probably much higher than my numbers based on conservative modeling.

**Market Dynamics:**

Shorts cannot cover their positions by just sitting on the BID due to these several factors:

1. **Tiny float and low volume.**

* It's important to note that there are only **4.02 million tradable shares out of 9.2 million outstanding.** Moreover, a significant chunk, **48%, is tightly held by large institutions and funds, further constraining the available supply.**

**2. High bid-ask spread:**

* Go   take a look at the L2 of the stock. Bid-Ask spread is often 15 cents  or  higher so shorts covering will dramatically affect the price

**Analysis:**

>**Shorts  find themselves in a tight spot, hoping for a sell-off that hasn't  materialized due to the limited float and low liquidity.**  
The  recent price action reflects their struggle, with rapid rebounds  despite brief pullbacks. The ongoing battle between shorts and buyers  intensifies, with shorts facing increasing pressure as prices soar.  
During  the initial 15 minutes of Tuesday's opening bell, the stock experienced  a sharp 12% decline amidst low trading volume. However, within the  subsequent 30 minutes, it swiftly rebounded, surging by over 10%.  
This  pattern repeated itself throughout the day on Wednesday, with each  pullback that touched the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) resulting  in dwindling trading volumes. Sellers were scarce as shorts scrambled  to cover their positions, seizing every opportunity to buy back shares  and driving the price progressively higher.

**Prediction:**

>**The majority of short positions are currently in deep waters, hoping for a substantial sell-off to cover their positions.**  
Many of these shorts, who initiated their positions last week and on Monday/Tuesday, find themselves **at least 20% underwater, if not more,** as indicated by the charts.  
We are approaching a critical juncture aka capitulation point where these shorts may face **margin calls** or increased pressure from a **short squeeze.**  
I anticipate that we will reach the **$30 mark by the end of the week**, which may trigger a cascade effect among shorts.  
In a bid to limit their losses, shorts may rapidly exit their positions by hitting the ask price, **exacerbating** the situation.  
**However,  this rush to exit could compound their problems due to the limited  float, wide bid-ask spread, and shallow liquidity, potentially  intensifying the squeeze into the big one that we've all been waiting  for.**

**Fundamental Strength of ROOT:**

ROOT's fundamentals add weight to its rally:

* **Business Turnaround:** Company has turned its business around and is basically at break even point and will be profitable soon
* **Healthy Financials**:    Root boasts about $500 million in unencumbered cash, generating    interest for the company. This financial flexibility virtually    eliminates bankruptcy concerns. Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,    further solidifying Root's stability.
* **Operating Loss Improvement**:    Root achieved a remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,    decreasing from $48 million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This    substantial improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and    cost management initiatives undertaken by the company.
* **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:    The net combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023. This    metric is crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the    relationship between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A    lower combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,    which suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are    effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.
* **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:    Root experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which   surged  by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year.   This  robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer   adoption and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings.   Moreover, gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million,   reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:    In Q4 2023, Root demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%    improvement in operating loss compared to the previous year. The net    combined ratio improved significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting    profitability.
* **Strategic Partnerships**:    Carvana, a major investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded  insurance   tech to offer car insurance directly to consumers. With  Carvana  holding  3.14 million shares, their partnership bolsters Root's  market  presence.
* **Expansion Plans**:    During today's earnings call, CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have    signed new embedded insurance partnerships in Q4, signaling further    growth potential.

574,$NNOX AI squeeze play,"If you liked/missed $SOUN and $BYND, come check out $NNOX. $SOUN was a $NVDA 13F play that turned into a short sqz. $BYND was a short squeeze shit co. Both stocks were short squeezed but guess what else they have in common? They're both on the nasdaq Reg SHO list with zero shares to borrow.

Then we have $NNOX which is on both the Reg SHO list AND also a part of $NVDA 13F (along with $SOUN and $RXRX). $NNOX also has earnings coming up next week 3/7 BMO. So far they've beat earnings every quarter the past year, unlike $SOUN $RXRX $BYND who typically miss. 

Chart looks like 🔥:
https://x.com/shardib2/status/1762933075384664088?s=46&t=alVl43I5ARaV2QaZUfQNNA

The mcap for $NNOX is ~600m (similar to $BYND) so when it moves, it MOVES (in either direction).


P.s. This is a high risk play so prepare for volatility downward if macros look gloomy or if AI sector sells off which is very possible. Take it as a gamble.

587,"Bull Flag Breakout… 2-29-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Reminder- I will not be trading past about 11-12 tomorrow and I will NOT have a weekly TA up this weekend. We will catch up on Monday. 

PCE data this morning ended up coming in just a little bit cooler than forecast which led to a massive pump on ES and NQ at 830am… One would have expected this day to be similar to February 22nd where we used data to squeeze all day long. However, the bears once again were in control intraday. 

We are now seeing a pretty steady trend that despite whatever strength bulls might have they are not able to continue the breakout. But on the same side of things we are not quite able to breakdown. Bears have struggled to seek continuation on the daily timeframe and also intraday. The last basically 5 days of trading since or massive squeeze on the back of NVDA earnings has been range based trading. 

&#x200B;

We get another heavy data drop tomorrow during opening hour. I am most curious to see what UMICH comes in at after the hotter then expected CPI/ PPI (and hot PCE). 

That was an interesting power hour move… we had a massive squeeze into the final minute just to watch ES drop almost 20 points in about 30 seconds. NQ faired a little better only dropping 50 points.

This sort of move we are seeing here could be setting up a Friday squeeze. However, with that flash crash the last one minute we actually did not get a new daily demand today. This is intriguing because we closed over previous supply/ resistance but didn’t have stronger daily buyers come in and we also did not put in a new demand. We could see a really nice failed breakout tomorrow. 

Bulls need to break through ATHs tomorrow and target the yellow trend line near 514.

Bears will look to drop back under daily 8ema support/ demand of 505.17

Yesterday on ES we had a massive double top rejection to put in a new supply and bearishly engulf the daily candle. However, thanks to data we actually bounced off the daily 8ema support and are closing over double supply of 5091-5095. Much like SPY thanks to that final flush we barely did not get a new demand despite closing over previous supply. ES did see buyers come in today though.  

I have been eyeing this range/ consolidation as a massive daily bull flag and it appears that we have officially broke out of that bull flag to the upside. 

Bulls will target a move to ATHs of 5123.5 and target the 5130-5140 area. 

Bears need to double top and close back under daily double supply of 5091-5095.

A bit of a difference here on QQQ is that we did get a new daily demand but we do still have daily sellers on QQQ compared to the daily buyers on NQ. I have never seen three back to back days where QQQ (or spy) had sellers and NQ (or ES) had buyers… That’s a very interesting divergence.

With a daily closure over previous supply of 437.83 and a new daily demand we are set up for a solid breakout tomorrow to ATHs of 440.59. 

Bears need to send this back under 437.83 and target daily 8ema support again.

 Supply- 437.83

We did get new daily buyers here on NQ and also a new daily demand at 17857.

We fought valiantly at the daily double supply of 18016-18038, however in the end the bulls won and closed over daily supply there. 

With this closure over this level we should again be looking for a squeezy Friday where we see a new ATHs and target the 18200 area. However, I cant help but keep in the back of my mind another massive failed breakout by the bulls tomorrow.

Bit of an interesting and divergent move here on 10YR and DXY. The 10yr had a major rejection off the 4.315% supply and came all the way down to daily 20ema support and 4.226% demand. 

The 10yr likely dropped because of “cooler” PCE. 

Bulls still need to close under 4.226% and then 4.151% to really breakout. 

Bears need to bounce off 20ema support here and target a move back to 4.315-4.353%.

To continue to add to the divergence on 10yr/ DXY I mentioned you are seeing that the Dollar actually had a major support bounce and breakout. 

DXY has been sitting in a very tight range of 103.775-103.967 for 5 days. Today we finally hard bounced off daily 50ema support and broke out closing over 103.967 supply/ resistance. 

Bears now have an opportunity to see DXY run back to the 104.854 area which certainly would open up some weakness. 

Bulls need to see an immediate rejection tomorrow and close back near that 103.775 demand area.

Had another good day of trading today. Today was a little more difficult in that most of my plays were stopped out at my profitable trigger. Honestly besides the 10am and 1130am dump there just was not much in the terms of solid moves today. For a data based day like we had at 830am I would have expected much better trading today. 

I am only going to be trading tomorrow early morning but so far been a great week of trading. 

I likely wont make a substantial payout the 1st to 5th for APEX but I am playing the long game here. Goals to get that payout 15th-20th. If I can keep up my same $200-$300 average then by 2nd week of March ill have two PAs ready for full payouts and will have numerous other evals ready to be converted to PAs too… this sets me up for a very nice April. 

I have only been trading one contract each trade (not even averaging in anymore) and I have really enjoyed that. While the gains are smaller at times and had I traded two cons every trade I would be at my profit goal on both already… the one con gives me the confidence to not only enter the trade early and when I see it playing out but also to hold to my targets more. 

Slow and steady wins this race. Honestly the hardest and longest part of the prop firm process is passing the EVALS and then building your buffer zone before you get that full first payout. But once you have built that buffer zone staying consistent leads to quicker and easier payouts.

588,FSLR is a winner,"I really don't understand why people are so excited about $ENPH when there is another company actually PRINTING MONEY hand over fist FIRST SOLAR $FSLR is the WINNER.

$FSLR is utility scale solar and not rooftop solar, it's also not a dirty used car salesmen being sued like $NOVA.

1. **Valuation Metrics:** First Solar currently trades at a lower trailing P/E ratio (19.28) compared to Enphase (38.67), indicating that it may be undervalued relative to its earnings. Furthermore, First Solar's forward P/E for 2024 is significantly lower (11.31) than Enphase's (38.61), suggesting that First Solar may offer better future earnings potential at a more attractive price.
2. **Analyst Price Targets:** Analysts have a bullish outlook on First Solar, with an average price target of $223.28, representing a substantial upside potential of approximately 45% from the current price. In contrast, Enphase's average price target of $131.74 implies a more modest upside of about 3.7%. If First Solar were to be trading at a similar Trailing P/E of 38.67 that would put their share price at $299.30 or about a 94% upside.
3. **Market Position and Demand:** First Solar has established itself as a leader in utility-scale solar projects, with a remarkable achievement of being completely sold out through 2026. This strong demand underscores the company's ability to secure long-term contracts and generate steady revenue streams. The company's recent earnings report demonstrated its resilience to interest rate fluctuations, further highlighting its ability to maintain stable revenue amidst changing market conditions. With a robust backlog of orders and a clear path to future growth, First Solar is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for renewable energy solutions.
4. **Risk Factors:** While both companies face regulatory and policy risks inherent to the renewable energy sector, First Solar's exposure to potential policy changes is mitigated by its diversified customer base and long-term contracts. Additionally, the company benefits from tax credits that support its growth initiatives, providing a buffer against regulatory uncertainties. First Solar is also largely immune to interest rate volatility as seen in their most recent earnings.
5. **Economies of Scale and Competitive Advantage:** First Solar's focus on utility-scale solar production allows it to benefit from economies of scale and cost efficiencies that are difficult for competitors to replicate. With a strong emphasis on innovation and technological advancements, First Solar is well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge in the market.

First Solar has an average analyst EPS target for 2025 of about $21, that means they are trading at 7.3x 2025 earnings which is INSANE. Even if the tax credits stopped in 2025, which again is highly unlikely, they would still be generating EPS of approximately $14, putting them at 11x 2025 forward earnings (non-tax subsidized earnings). The inflation reduction act allows First Solar to create a moat that will be almost impossible to cross in the future. Come on people, open your eyes and realize you can shoot fish in a barrel or chase nonsense.

Literally all you have to do is take two minutes and go to yahoo finance and look at the numbers. You don't even have to be smart, just compare them, and any idiot will see that this is a stock that's being largely overlooked.

https://preview.redd.it/i1g3cmi1wllc1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1b6626e8b2d123ba1a1481e2ba94795ea689655

The Western USA Mining Report, a recent publication by Global Business Reports, delves into the significance of commodities such as copper, lithium, uranium, and rare earth minerals in the Western USA, highlighting their pivotal role in the global transition towards a greener and more electrified future.

The latest issue of the report spotlighted Grid Battery Metals Inc. (Ticker: CELL.v or EVKRF for US investors). Grid Battery's inclusion in this publication underscores its active and successful role in mineral exploration within the Western USA. The comprehensive article, features insights from Grid's CEO, Mr. Tim Fernback, discussing the company's ongoing lithium exploration initiatives in Nevada, its robust corporate balance sheet, and its strategic objectives for the year 2024.

Grid Battery Metals Inc. specializes in the exploration of high-value battery metals crucial for the electric vehicle (EV) market, aligning with the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions. 

Grid's Texas Springs Property, situated adjacent to Surge Battery Metals Inc.'s (NILI.v) Nevada North Lithium Project which has returned lithium grades up to 8070ppm, has shown promising results in lithium exploration, with significant lithium grades identified during exploration programs. 

Similarly, its Clayton Valley Lithium Project, characterized by its extensive lithium lode and placer claims, capitalizes on the region's geological features conducive to lithium enrichment. 

As Grid continues to advance its exploration endeavors and solidify its presence in key lithium-rich regions of the Western USA, its collaboration with Global Business Reports underscores its commitment to transparency, innovation, and sustainable resource development.

Grid Battery's strategic acquisitions and exploration efforts exemplify its dedication to contributing to the burgeoning EV market while simultaneously addressing the global demand for sustainable energy sources

593,ROOT Squeeze: Shorts Throwing in the Towel,"ROOT,  which has skyrocketed from $7 to $28 in just five trading days, didn't  slow down one bit today as it surged higher 14% hitting a whopping  $34.41.

Now, you might be  scratching your head, wondering how this is even possible. Is this the  top? Should you bet against ROOT with short positions or pus?

Well,  before you make any moves, let's go over why betting against ROOT might  not be the wisest choice right now, and why shorts find themselves in a  **grim predicament, trapped and underwater** amidst this rapid ascent that seems never ending.

&#x200B;

**Here's why shorts—those betting against ROOT—are in hot water:**

**1) ROOT's Strong Fundamentals and Finances**

* **Business Turnaround:**  With break-even adj. EBITDA and robust growth, ROOT's Q4 quarter has  left the market stunned. They went from a business staring at bankruptcy  to one that is break-even and will see profitability soon.
* **Healthy Financials**:     Root boasts about $500 million in unencumbered cash, generating     interest for the company. This financial flexibility virtually     eliminates bankruptcy concerns. Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,     further solidifying Root's stability.
* **Leading Tech:**  In an industry ripe for innovation, ROOT has the edge for sustained  success due to its mobile app that collects driving data on breaking,  speed of turns, times of the  day, miles driven, and driving routes.  Root doesn’t exclusively price car insurance based on pricing, but the  driving test has about a 40%  weight in their models. It has a  proprietary claims system and machine learning, allowing for automated  loss expense, fast claims payout, and thus higher customer satisfaction.
* **Outperforming Competitors:** When compared to Lemonade (LMND), ROOT boasts faster growth and higher profitability, yet **trades at a 85%  discount.**
* **Operating Loss Improvement**:     Root achieved a remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,     decreasing from $48 million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This     substantial improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and     cost management initiatives undertaken by the company.
* **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:     The net combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023.  This metric is crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the     relationship between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A     lower combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,     which suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are     effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.
* **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:     Root experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which    surged  by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year.    This  robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer    adoption and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings.    Moreover, gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million,    reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:     In Q4 2023, Root demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%     improvement in operating loss compared to the previous year. The net     combined ratio improved significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting     profitability.
* **Strategic Partnerships**:     Carvana, a major investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded   insurance   tech to offer car insurance directly to consumers. With   Carvana  holding 6 million shares, their partnership bolsters Root's   market  presence.
* **Expansion Plans**:  During Wednesday's earnings call, CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have  signed new embedded insurance partnerships in Q4, signaling further     growth potential.

**2)  Shorts are trapped by several factors including limited tradable  shares, significant institutional holding, declining volume, and high  bid-ask spreads.**

* Out of 9.2 million outstanding shares, **only 4.02 million are tradable.**
* A substantial portion, accounting for **48%, is firmly held by large institutions and insiders**, further restricting the available supply.
* Volume levels are relatively low and on a downward trend.
* Notably,  bid-ask spreads in ROOT's order book frequently exceed 15 cents. When  coupled with the aforementioned factors, this dynamic means that short  sellers underwater cannot cover their positions without significantly  impacting the price.

**3) The short interest data for ROOT tells a compelling story:**

* On Thursday, 2/22, **53%** of 5.2 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.
* On Friday, 2/23, **52%** of 2.2 million shares were sold short, amounting to around 1.14 million shares.
* Monday's short data revealed a Short Volume of 641,672 shares, constituting **36.86%** of the total reported volume.
* Tuesday's short data showed a Short Volume of 491,415 shares, comprising **56.31%** of the total reported volume.
* Wednesday's Short Volume was 291,972 shares, accounting for **51.13%** of the total reported volume for the day. Over the past 30 days, the average Short Volume has been 49.68%.
* Today's Short Volume stands at 661,700 shares, representing **60.90%** of the total reported volume for the day.

**How Many Trapped Shorts are There?**

>**Last Thursday:** Approximately 0 shares short (conservatively assuming 100% have covered out of 2.75 million).  
**Last Friday:** About 114,000 shares short (conservatively assuming 10% have not covered out of 1.14 million).  
**Monday:** Around 192,501 shares short (conservatively assuming 30% have not covered out of 641,672).  
**Tuesday:** Roughly 294,849 shares short (conservatively assuming 60% not have covered out of 491,415).  
**Wednesday:** Estimated 189,781 shares short (assuming 65% have not covered out of 291,972).  
**Thursday:** Estimated 595,530 shares short (assuming 90% have not covered out of 661,700).

**Total Shares Short:**

>**The combined short interest across these days amounts to 1,386,661 shares short or around 34.3%.**  
Note that the actual figures are probably much higher than my numbers based on conservative modeling

**Analysis:**

>**Again,  the Shorts find themselves in a tight spot, hoping for a sell-off that  hasn't  materialized due to the limited float and low liquidity.**  
>  
>  
Today,  the price convincingly broke above the $30 resistance level with  notable volume, a point I highlighted in my post yesterday as a critical  juncture that could compel short sellers to capitulate.  
>  
>  
**As anticipated, the price surged from $30 to over $34 within an hour.**  
>  
>  
However,  shorts quickly entered the market at the $33 mark, causing the stock to  dip below VWAP to $30.01 with light trading volume. Nevertheless, it  rebounded to close the day at the $32 level.  
>  
>  
This sequence of events further validates my earlier hypothesis that numerous short positions are **deeply underwater, desperately attempting to offset their losses wherever they can.**  
>  
>  
When  the price dropped from $33 to $30.01, shorts rushed to cover their  positions, eagerly buying back shares and propelling the price higher  with each transaction.

**Prediction:**

>**The  majority of short positions are currently in a dangerous position,  hoping for a significant sell-off to mitigate their losses.**  
>  
>  
Many of these short sellers, who initiated their positions over the past week, now find themselves at least **35% underwater, if not more**, as illustrated by the accompanying charts.  
>  
>  
We  stand at a critical juncture, approaching a capitulation point where  these short positions may encounter margin calls or increased pressure  from a short squeeze.  
I anticipate that we will breach the **$35** mark by the end of the week, potentially triggering a domino effect among short sellers.  
>  
>  
In  an attempt to minimize their losses, short sellers may hastily exit  their positions by accepting the ask price, thereby exacerbating the  situation.  
However, this rush to  exit could exacerbate their difficulties due to the limited float, wide  bid-ask spread, and shallow liquidity, potentially amplifying the  intensity of the anticipated squeeze that many have been anticipating.  
>  
>  
**With each surge in price, the likelihood of an unprecedented short squeeze grows stronger.**  
>  
>  
It's akin to a boiling kettle with a strip of Scotch tape keeping the lid in place—for now.  
>  
>  
However, the longer the tape holds, the more powerful the eventual release will be. **I foresee a monumental event on the horizon: the grand short squeeze that could push this up to $50.**

613,West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. Sees Strong Volume Today After Upsizing Private Placement of Shares and Gold-Linked Notes,"West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (trading as WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) closed in the green today on by above-average trading volume after announcing it has upsized its private placement from US$20M to US$23 due to high demand.

https://preview.redd.it/c47g9kk6ttlc1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74af2a6c154bb92c2d85e7b67915244fdf2f1f5

This heightened investor interest is a testament to the confidence in WRLG's gold projects, and vision. Notably, the expanded private placement includes gold-linked notes, a strategic move by the company to leverage its potential amidst the dynamic gold market landscape.

The decision to increase the private placement underscores the strong appetite for investment in WRLG's flagship Madsen Gold Project, nestled in Canada's high-grade Red Lake gold district. With substantial investments already poured into the project and a fully permitted gold mine currently being explored and developed, WRLG is poised for significant growth.

The Madsen Gold Project boasts impressive mineral resources, with indicated mineral reserves of 1.65 million ounces of gold and inferred resources of 0.37 million ounces. These figures, coupled with the company's operational infrastructure and strategic partnerships, position it as a promising player in the gold mining sector.

This latest development is an important moment for WRLG as it secures the necessary funds to further advance its operations. The raised capital will fuel exploration activities, operational enhancements, and overall project development, propelling WRLG closer to its production goals and unlocking even greater value for its investors.

634,ROOT Squeeze: Can It Continue?,"Just as I [predicted last Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1b3lsub/root_squeeze_shorts_throwing_in_the_towel/), ROOT did precisely what was predicted, squeezing another 21.8% on Friday and soaring an additional $7, extending its remarkable run from $7 to the high of $42 in just six trading days. 

**The question on everyone's mind now: Can it continue? Will it?**

I'll admit to you that nothing ascends in a parabolic straight line indefinitely.  

Every upward trend eventually pauses and retraces before resuming its bullish trend, especially for a stock like ROOT which has the perfect combination of strong fundamentals, financials and underlying market technicals - tiny float with majority of shares locked up, relatively low volume, high-bid ask spread, and thin liquidity. 

The challenge lies in predicting when this might  occur.

In my view, several compelling reasons suggest that ROOT may continue its upward trajectory today:

**1. Strong Fundamentals and Financials:** 

* **Business Turnaround:**  With break-even adj. EBITDA  and robust growth, ROOT's Q4 quarter has  left the market stunned. They  went from a business staring at bankruptcy  to one that is break-even  and will see profitability soon.     
 
* **Healthy Financials**:     Root boasts about $500  million in unencumbered cash, generating     interest for the company.  This financial flexibility virtually     eliminates bankruptcy concerns.  Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,     further solidifying Root's  stability.     
 
* **Leading Tech:**  In an industry ripe for innovation,  ROOT has the edge for sustained  success due to its mobile app that  collects driving data on breaking,  speed of turns, times of the  day,  miles driven, and driving routes.  Root doesn’t exclusively price car  insurance based on pricing, but the  driving test has about a 40%   weight in their models. It has a  proprietary claims system and machine  learning, allowing for automated  loss expense, fast claims payout, and  thus higher customer satisfaction.     
 
* **Outperforming Competitors:** When compared to Lemonade (LMND), ROOT boasts faster growth and higher profitability, yet **trades at a 85%  discount.**   
 
* **Operating Loss Improvement**:     Root achieved a  remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,     decreasing from $48  million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This     substantial  improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and     cost  management initiatives undertaken by the company.     
 
* **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:     The net  combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023.  This metric is  crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the     relationship  between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A     lower  combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,     which  suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are      effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.     
 
* **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:     Root  experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which    surged   by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year.    This   robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer    adoption  and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings.    Moreover,  gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million,     reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.     
 
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:     In Q4 2023, Root  demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%     improvement in operating  loss compared to the previous year. The net     combined ratio improved  significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting     profitability.     
 
* **Strategic Partnerships**:     Carvana, a major  investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded   insurance   tech to offer  car insurance directly to consumers. With   Carvana  holding 6 million  shares, their partnership bolsters Root's   market  presence.     
 
* **Expansion Plans**:  During Wednesday's earnings call,  CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have  signed new embedded insurance  partnerships in Q4, signaling further     growth potential.    

[ROOT Company Analysis](https://modernvalueinvesting.substack.com/p/root-inc-disruptive-insurtech-delivers) 

**2)  ROOT's technical factors: tiny float and limited  tradable  shares, significant institutional holding, and high bid-ask spreads.** 

* Out of 9.2 million outstanding shares, **only 4.02 million are tradable.**   
 
* A substantial portion, accounting for **48%, is firmly held by large institutions and insiders**, further restricting the available supply.     
 
* Notably,  bid-ask spreads in ROOT's order book frequently exceed 15  cents. When  coupled with the aforementioned factors, this dynamic means  that short  sellers underwater cannot cover their positions without  significantly  impacting the price.     
 

**3) The short interest data for ROOT tells a compelling story:** 

* On Thursday, 2/22, **53%** of 5.2 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 2.75 million shares.     
 
* On Friday, 2/23, **52%** of 2.2 million shares were sold short, amounting to around 1.14 million shares.     
 
* Monday's short data revealed a Short Volume of 641,672 shares, constituting **36.86%** of the total reported volume.     
 
* Tuesday's short data showed a Short Volume of 491,415 shares, comprising **56.31%** of the total reported volume.     
 
* Wednesday's Short Volume was 291,972 shares, accounting for **51.13%** of the total reported volume for the day. Over the past 30 days, the average Short Volume has been 49.68%.     
 
* Thursday''s Short Volume stands at 661,700 shares, representing **60.90%** of the total reported volume for the day.   
* On Friday, 2/23, **64.59%** of 1.8 million shares were sold short, totaling approximately 1.2 million shares. 

**How Many Trapped Shorts are There?**

**High Short Interest:**

Note that the actual figures are probably much higher than my numbers based on conservative modeling   

**Analysis:** 

>Many who held short positions from two weeks ago or last week may have closed their positions, been forced out due to squeezes, or even added to their shorts on Friday to improve their average cost in hopes of minimizing losses or breaking even.   
>  
>On Friday, a new wave of short sellers entered the market, aiming to capitalize on a potential pullback after the stock reached $40-42.  
>  
>Once the price broke above $35 level with notable volume last Friday, many short sellers began to capitulate and squeeze which increased the prices to $42 before pulling back sharply to $35 which then got **bought up quickly pulling the price back up to $40.**   
>  
>To me, this is a sign that there are a lot of shorts who are still underwater and trapped as they covered ferociously **desperately attempting to offset their losses wherever they can.**   
>  
>Subsequently, the price consolidated within the $37-39 range until the market closed.  
>  
>**In my view, many new short sellers seized this opportunity to initiate fresh positions, anticipating a pullback in the following week for potential profits.**  
>  
>On Monday, $39 will serve as a critical resistance level, with $37 acting as support.   
>  
>**If the price manages to surpass $39 and clears $42 with strong volume, we could witness another surge in short covering, potentially propelling the price to $45 and beyond next week.**   
>  
>However, a break below $37 might signal a retracement to the $35 level, leading to consolidation, or even a temporary reversal in the trend.

**Prediction:**   


>On Monday, pay close attention to the $39 resistance level, while considering $37 as pivotal support.   
>  
>**If the price successfully breaches $39 and clears $42 with substantial volume, anticipate another surge of short covering, potentially propelling the price to $45 and beyond in the following week.**  
>  
>Conversely, if the price dips below $37, we might witness a retracement  to the $35 level, leading to consolidation or even a temporary reversal of the bullish current trend.  
>  
>A breakout above the mentioned resistance levels could trigger a sharp squeeze, as numerous short sellers who entered positions over the past  two weeks now find themselves at least 40% underwater, if not more.   
>  
>This  could force them to either double down at higher prices or cover their  positions. The stock's strong fundamentals, coupled with a narrow  bid-ask spread, relatively low volume, limited float, and  insider/institutional holding, defy conventional market forces and  sustain its upward momentum.  
>

647,"The Changing of Guard… 3-4-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

I am finally back from my trip and I have got to say todays market made me wish we took the surprise trip to Orlando my wife wanted to do… Straight phenomenon after phenomenon in this market. Today officially marks another day of something I have never seen before. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9h5seh5udmc1.png?width=327&format=png&auto=webp&s=469fa38c1fd399e5f041691dbd3825c271693aec

This screenshot was taken at 130pm. I have never in my life seen a day where Apple and Google were down over 3%, yet NQ was barely even red. I have also never seen a day where NVDA was up 5.4% while the rest of the market essentially was red. Historically if apple was down 3% like this we would be looking at easily a 2-3% red day on NQ. While NVDA is now number three in holdings by market cap, Apple remains the number two by market cap. I have never seen a day where Apple was down this much and NQ acted like it didn’t even notice. While I also understand that Tesla is not that major of a holdings in NQ anymore market cap wise, a 7%+ drop is a major drop there. 

Perhaps this is a true changing of the guard and we are truly seeing chips/ AI companies run this market (namely NVDA) but I for one have never seen anything like this before. 

The thing that is really interesting though is the fact that ES (SPY) actually was the leader today, while NQ (QQQ) was absolutely the laggard all day. The question would be then if NQ (tech) is not leading this rally what is? 

I also don’t know where that 230pm squeeze candle came from or why but after sitting in a range all day that candle was extremely rogue.

Since I didn’t get to do a weekly TA lets talk about the agenda this week… which is jammed packed!

The most notable data points is ADP Non Farm and JOLTS Wednesday, Challenge/ nonfarm/ jobless claims on Thursday and then ending the week with the all so importantly Unemployment Rate Friday.

JPOW is set to testify Wednesday and Thursday. This is a yearly even that happens and generally this even is EXTREMELY Volatile Wednesday once the opening remarks statement is released. Usually before he testifies he releases a prewritten statement which can cause some incredible reactions. Tomorrow nights TA I will try to include a breakdown of that for you guys.

I wanted to remind everyone that despite people thinking “we are at ATHs we should short” this is not the time nor the market to be short… here is another fun statistic that show after markets go on a historical 4 month 20%+ run that the markets have 100% of the time be higher 6 months and 12 month later… on average the next 12 months pushes up 18.4%... This means that SPY could see $522.41 area, SPX near 5233 area and ES near 5241 area by early 2025.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8s60r7p6udmc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b1262ae7d552a25cd45978e3f1e99865f3362c

Even historically from a bull market perspective we are just getting started. The average bull market is about 991 days and currently we are sitting at 508 days. The average bull market total% gain is also 87% which we currently are sitting at about 42% total gain. That means we could see an additional 45% from here (on average) which brings SPY to $536, SPX to 5369 and ES to the 5377 area before this bull market is finally over. 

As you can see there is plenty of upside potential in this market… I think the only true opportunity bears have here is FOMC and CPI in March but I also think those could easily be buy the dip opportunities. 

Remember markets need a REASON TO SELL initially but more importantly markets need a REASON TO KEEP SELLING after the first dip. People (me included) forget this at times. 

I will end the intro here by saying if you spent any time on social media this weekend or today this feels exactly like 2020s bull market. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zby0nz57udmc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1db9793ead27941b9bafb8911c5396bbcea46fb

On Friday we saw daily buyers return to the market and made a new ATHs during the squeeze. That also put a new daily demand at 508.14. This new demand is actually a bit of a phenomenon too because very rarely do you put in a supply and then put in a new demand over that supply level. Generally speaking that’s just now how price action and supply/ demand works. 

We are attempting to re-enter extreme daily bull momentum on SPY as we continue to approach this yellow bull channel resistance line. ES wise the bulls looked to be in control all day long until power hour when they sold us off much like what happened on 2/23/24. With this nice doji rejection here we have a classic evening doji star bearish reversal pattern forming for tomorrow. 

Bulls will look to breakout to the channel resistance of 515.72 tomorrow and seek a new ATHs. 

Bears will look to use this daily doji rejection to backtest daily 8ema support near 508.14 demand.  

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 507.03  
 Demand- 508.14

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Looking at ES here we had a very mild range today but we continued to see daily buyers come in to support further upside and this new ATH. 

After Fridays demand of 5012 was put in we backtested and bounced off previous double supply/ resistance of 5091-5095 to now turn that into support.  Today ES attempted to hold the market up and attempted to push up without its friend NQ but by power hour it just didn’t have any thing left to give causing a really nice rejection to form here like 2/23/24. 

Bulls will seek a move to this yellow resistance line of 5171 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to use this daily double top doji rejection to backtest daily 8ema support near 5100 (projected) tomorrow. 

ES FUUTRES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5091 -> 5095  
 Demand- 5072

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

QQQ had already put the new daily demand on Thursday at 435.23 which allowed Fridays squeeze to breakout to new ATHs. The Qs surprisingly despite stronger daily buyers here did not see a new ATHs today. 

QQQ also is attempting to re-enter extreme daily bull momentum. Tech continues to be the laggard and is not as of the moment leading the upside charge. One could almost argue that SPY is holding QQQ up as of late. QQQ ended up with a really nice daily double top rejection here to close out the daily. Outside of a daily double bottom we are likely going to see a drop to daily 8ema support overnight. Perhaps even a gap down. 

Bulls are going to seek out an ATHs move and attempt to breach the 450s for the first time in history. 

Bears have another opportunity here to use this double top to drop back to the previous supply/ demand at 435.23-437.83 and backtest daily 8 and 20ema support.  

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 437.83  
 Demand- 435.23

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6et6dqb8udmc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce9cd4011ed9cda6c853c5bd41adc8017351cf5

Much like QQQ here after putting in our demand last week we backed the daily double supply/ resistance at 18016-18038 and were able to nicely confirm that now as support. 

Up until power hour we actually had daily buyers supporting further upside, however by EOD they actually did weaken leaving us with this drop. 

Bulls need to seek out a new ATHs and target a move to the next major resistance area of 18400-18500. 

Bears will attempt to use this double top rejection as a resistance/ rejection point to then backtest daily 8ema support near 18100 (projected). 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18016 -> 18038s  
 Demand- 17857

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k1pdzjr8udmc1.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cfde671c9c475f8a45f91c4591e23196e674e0d

A really interesting move here on the 10yr in that it got a true inside day. Very rarely on the 10yr do you see a move like this. The 10yr is now sitting inside the daily 50ema and daily 8ema. 

We came very close to getting a new daily demand, however, we did not get one today. 

This triple demand/ support area from 4.151-4.244% barely is still holding on. 

Bulls need to use this opportunity to breakdown under 4.151% and target a move back to 3.863% demand. 

Bears have to find support here and retake the daily 8ema resistance at 4.246% to then retest 4.315-4.353%. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.315 -> 4.337 -> 4.353%  
 Demand- 3.863 -> 4.151 -> 4.226 -> 4.244%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY**

I think honestly even more surprising than the 10yr move is the fact that DXY has been sandwiched inside a very tight range of 103.775-104.147 for 10 trading days now. 

Bulls cant quite break under 103.775 to then seek 103.026 and bears cant quite break over 104.147 to then seek 104.854. 

We are not seeing a lot of directional agreement on the 10YR and DXY which certainly makes trading the markets even more difficult too. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.147 -> 104.854  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 103.775

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mzw4gfj9udmc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=099fa0b84d46490df918f9792a4d1857c9600c99

Honestly this was a TOUGH day of trading for me. I also had a small red day on Friday before I had to leave. The last 2-3 weeks has been a lot of mean reversion plays meaning 15min double tops and double bottom with failed breakouts and breakdowns. The last two days have been anything but that on ES.

Another thing that is really hurting me from a technical stand point is the fact that we are seeing so much divergence from ES and NQ. Meaning we are seeing one extremely strong while another is extremely weak. For instance, all day long we saw ES holding 15min EMA support while until 230 (with that rogue candle) we saw NQ holding 15min EMA resistance. In my opinion for how I trade it is very difficult finding great setups when we see this divergence. 

I ended up failing two 25k evals with my morning losses). I opened two new 25k evals which I was able to hit about $813 in profits on so im 50% to the $1500 target. This actually puts me in a better place than I was at open on those accounts. 

MFFU wise I came within $300 on one and $350 on another of passing those evals today. Those accounts have a static drawdown (meaning its EOD not trailing live like APEX) so I was able to play them a little differently. I expected the breakout which did eventually come and I knew on my MFFU accounts I could benefit from the non-trail drawdown. I should be able to pass those accounts tomorrow if all goes well. 

The MFFU $965.64 you see is this fun competition that MFFU is putting on. Essentially you are “given” a $10,000 account and have no drawdown limit (besides $0). You are allowed to trade one contract at a time mini or 10 micros. It’s a month long competition to see who can make the most profits in the month. As of Friday I was in 30th place and with this green finish today and this toxic PA I likely will be higher placed now. 

My MFFU and APEX PAs ended up finishing exactly flat being up 10 cents in APEX and down $31 in MFFU. Honestly just a tough day of trading. 

I actually really enjoy range based trading, however, this tight 15pt range stuff makes it very difficult to trade it correctly and well (for me at least). 

I am hoping for a green day tomorrow but if I am red tomorrow then I likely will take a break from my PAs and focus on EVALs until im back in a good place trading. The biggest thing with these props are once you pass them is maintaining them. The hardest part isn’t passing them but its rather getting through the trailing threshold and to the payout max. IF you think about it on a $50k account you essentially have $2500 of trailing drawdown… you have to hit $3000 in profits -> $2600 to break the buffer -> $2000 to get max payout… so essentially you have to take a $2500 account and 3x it to be able to get a full payout.

654,Dolly Varden Silver (DV.v) Surges on High Volume Amid Gold Potential (Article Summary),"*Today DV.v is trading up 8% on almost 2x its average volume*

https://preview.redd.it/46xejyhk1fmc1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc4799ce3cb435f81d876792f47a45ecfcdeba21

Is Dolly Varden Silver on the cusp of a significant transformation, potentially evolving from its historical roots as a silver powerhouse into a burgeoning gold entity? As highlighted by Bob Moriarty of 321gold.com in an article released today, recent assay results certainly suggest so. 

Renowned for its ownership of one of Canada's historic highest-grade silver mines, Dolly Varden Silver recently unveiled assay results that have set the investment community abuzz. With gold grades reminiscent of the nearby ""legendary"" Eskay Creek Mine, the company finds itself at a pivotal juncture. Moriarty's analysis delves into the implications of these findings, raising the intriguing question: Is it time for Dolly Varden Silver to consider a name change reflective of its expanding gold endowment?

The parallels drawn between Dolly Varden Silver and the famed Eskay Creek Mine are striking. Situated near Skeena Resources' revived Eskay Creek Project, Dolly Varden's Homestake Project, acquired from Fury Gold Mines in 2021, has yielded promising results. Drill assays reveal gold grades that rival those of Eskay Creek's heyday, showcasing the potential for a significant gold resource. Highlights include remarkable grades of 79.49 grams per tonne gold and 60 grams per tonne silver over 12.45 meters, among others.

Dolly Varden Silver's resource base stands poised for a substantial update following a fully funded 2024 drill program, with over CA$40 million invested in exploration since the last resource estimate in 2019. The current resource estimate, predominantly silver, is supplemented by a burgeoning gold component, projected at approximately 1.5 million ounces gold equivalent. 

However, it's not just the geological potential that commands attention. Dolly Varden Silver's tightly held share structure presents an intriguing investment proposition. Institutional ownership, coupled with strategic investments from industry stalwarts such as Hecla Mining and Eric Sprott, leaves a mere 7% float for retail investors. 

Given this, Moriarty argues that should generalist investors return to the precious metals sector, the scarcity of available shares could catalyze a significant uptick in demand, potentially propelling Dolly Varden Silver to new heights.

Dolly Varden Silver's recent foray into high-grade gold territory has captured the imagination of investors and industry observers alike. With assay results evoking comparisons to the illustrious Eskay Creek Mine, the company finds itself at a crossroads. As it navigates this juncture, the prospect of a name change to reflect its evolving gold endowment looms large. 

With a robust resource base, tightly held shares, and a promising future ahead, Dolly Varden Silver emerges as a compelling contender in the realm of precious metals mining.

658,AI has become the key to the chip industry recovery: Meta / Microsoft / WiMi develop their AI technology," 

Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued to rise in 2024, adding about $500 billion to its market value in about six weeks. Driven by AI, Nvidia has almost monopolized the AI chip market with an 80% market share, and the H20 chip customized for China has also accepted pre-orders.

The rise of self-generated AI has revealed the infinite possibilities of AI, and it has also spawned the demand for stronger, smarter, and more efficient AI chips. In last year’s wave of generative AI, Nvidia was the undisputed biggest winner. Predictably, AI applications are ubiquitous and have become a new battleground between chip giants.

**Meta plans to launch a new AI chip, Artemisintelligence**ial intelligence gold rush, the chip war will burn more and more in 2024. To support the artificial intelligence business, Meta (META) plans to deploy a new custom chip in its data center this year, and Meta plans to launch Artemis of AI chips for model reasoning this year, to reduce its reliance on Nvidia chips.

Meta h,as been improving its computing power to meet generative AI products in applications such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as hardware devices such as Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said last month that the company plans to have about 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 processors by the end of the year, and with other suppliers, Meta will have 600,000 H100 equivalent computing power.

**AMD / Microsoft makes a full preparation for AI chips**

In addition, US chip giant AMD (AMD) recently raised its 2024 AI processor sales forecast by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. AMD CEO Zifeng Su said on the conference call that its AI chip sales could exceed its current forecasts of $3.5 billion once more capacity starts in the second half of the year.

Microsoft (MSFT), which is betting on AI, has also launched its first AI chip, Maia 100, to compete with Nvidia’s GPU and reduce its expensive reliance on Nvidia. Maia 100 Using the 5nm process, the number of transistors reaches 105 billion, which can be used for large language model training and reasoning.

The two chips are reportedly expected to go on sale in 2024. Both custom chips power Microsoft’s Azure data center and prepare for a future full of artificial intelligence. Nadella said Maia will first support Microsoft’s own AI applications and then to partners and customers.

There is no doubt that demand for AI chips is extremely strong, and most companies around the world are looking for alternatives to the Nvidia H100. According to the latest forecast from market research firm Gartner, the AI chip market will grow 25.6% from the previous year to $67.1 billion by 2024. Gartner The AI chip marketofexpected to be more than twice the size of 2023 by 2027, reaching $119.4 billion.

**WiMi explores the value from the industrial chain**

Definitely, the outlook for AI chip demand is extremely promising. Data shows, as a leading AI vision enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) under the boom of artificial intelligence, currently in semiconductor, algorithm and holographic AR light field technology module and other core technology has strong strength, and has developed its AI chip business, to enterprise customers provide computer chip products and central processing algorithm and related services comprehensive solutions and software and semiconductor business.

At present, the new generation of artificial intelligence technology has given WiMi a new role. WiMi based on AI chip is no longer limited to command control, but to carry out more image structure and big data analysis, which requires CPU and other traditional chip architecture to meet the needs of AI applications. At the same time, with the deepening of the industry, WiMiAI chip technology has gradually expanded to the related scene. In terms of horizontal development, AI vision is promoted to intelligent home, commercial buildings, intelligent security, intelligent retail, autonomous driving, robots and other broader application scenarios.

No doubt, 2024 will be a year of strong chip growth, and AI, electrification, energy transition, etc., all need a large number of chip support. With its excellent technical strength and market performance, WiMi actively promotes the development and application of artificial intelligence technology, and plays an important role in the era of artificial intelligence. With the acceleration of the global digital transformation, WiMi is expected to maintain its lead and drive the global semiconductor industry.

**To sum up**

In the past few years, the global chip industry has been in a downturn, with the entire industry oversupply and the pressure on chip inventory increasing. Today, the development of large models and generative artificial intelligence is significantly driving the growth of the intelligent computing power market, and the various giants are driving the boom of the chip industry. However, as the competition in the AI chip market intensifies, it will be interesting to see who will emerge from the AI wave, and how this important market will change in the future.",1709621593,822130,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,2a1ed8de1c58fabab4bcc815391fb85f1d83c4efeeae4cbe24fe98e8dd7b5641,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1b6yzhw/ai_has_become_the_key_to_the_chip_industry/

663,"Risk Off Into JPOW… 3-5-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

If you read my TA last night you know after that rejection EOD yesterday off ATHs that I was expecting markets to have a red day today and that I even suspected a gap down was possible. The markets absolutely did not disappoint today. This is one of the cleanest and strongest bear trend days we have had in a very long time. 

Intraday (5 and 15min) timeframe wise something that really impressed me today is the fact that overall selling was not that impressive. What I mean is that relative to some of our other trend days (up or down) the strength (level of intensity) of sellers really wasn’t that incredible. That tells me that today at least there was strictly no buyers (or at minimum very few buyers) to fight these sellers. That is certainly a major change of pace. 

The question is probably why did we sell off so strongly? Outside of the fact that this market has just been pushing nonstop for almost 5 months now we have a major event tomorrow. JPOW is set to testify to congress. This is a yearly thing that occurs every march. It does generally bring some volatility to the markets. 

JPOW is scheduled to speak starting at 10am and generally it will last both days into about 2pm. The reaction to his pre-written introduction can be pretty impressive. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b417k3080lmc1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=29eb93443371eeee47e2f3bab1dd234df4464e21

Honestly it’s a bit hit or miss on what markets will do over night. We have seen a flat open, a green open and a red open. The one thing that I did notice though is if we open green we always close higher than that and if we open red we always close lower than that. There also appears to be a small correlation between the opening move (whether red or green) and what the market does at 10am when he speaks. Meaning if we opened green there is decent odds markets pump us at 10am. 

Now I will say that it is 100% a risk and even more of a risk than FOMC or CPI to play the 10am move. However, having traded this even numerous times the first day at least whatever our 10am reaction is… we generally push nicely in the direction of that move for most of the day. As you can see in 2021 we had doji reactions though (meaning the 10am candle closed as a doji) so we do need to tread lightly. 

Interesting enough the biggest thing to note is that over the last three years all three times the two day move was right around 1.3% +/-. 

The one thing preventing me from being bearish tomorrow is the fact that for basically two years markets have been saying “this is the event that starts the next correction” and yet the market continues to ignore and shake off everything. For the last five months we have seen the exact same setup numerous times… and every single time the markets has found some sort of subset of data that has allowed the market to rally to a new ATHs instead of taking the much needed correction. Is this time different? Will JPOW have the power to start a true 5-10% correction? Or is this just your classic buy the rumor sell the news (or in this case… sell the rumor and buy the news) type of reaction forming? 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see a major daily double bottom overnight on ES and NQ. The EOD pump we saw today and the daily candle structure reminds me a lot of February 13th and 20th would certainly could lead to a major upside move tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ug0a5le80lmc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ff8553ba203211a342b816372d96f6406fa4c1b

We had a major drop in buyers on SPY today and put in a new supply at 512.46. With a closure both below the previous demand of 508.14 and daily 8ema support we are going to target a drop back to daily 20ema support of 502.3 which is just above supply of 502. 

Bears have an opportunity to take us to that level tomorrow depending on how algos react to JPOW. If we close under the daily 20ema support of 502.3 for the first time basically in 4 months then this might finally be the correction everyone has been waiting for. 

Bulls need to find a major double bottom and retake the daily 8ema resistance at 507.35 (projected). To be back in control. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 512.46  
 Demand- 495.38 -> 508.14

ES also put in a new daily supply at 5142 but was not able to break below previous demand/ support of 5072. The daily did close back under the daily 8ema support though.  

Bears are going to look to backtest the daily 20ema support near 5045 (projected) and take out the 5051 supply that sits just above it. IF we close under daily 20ema support then our target will be the 4961-4989 triple demand/ support area. 

Bulls need to see a massive daily double bottom to retake daily 8ema resistance at 5089 (projected) to be back in control.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5051 -> 5142

On QQQ this not only an impressive gap down but also an impressive intraday candle. As you can see we opened and outside of one penny of green markets never saw the upside. A very rare day indeed. This is once again the strongest daily sellers since January 8th. 

With a new daily supply at 445.64 and closure under daily 8ema we are at a critical bounce spot here. It would have been far more bearish had we been able to close below 435.23 daily demand and especially more bearish under daily 20ema support.  

Bears need to close under daily 20ema support and target the demand level of 424.49 which also brings a long awaited daily 50ema support test. 

Bulls will need to hard bounce here and retake the daily 8ema resistance of 438 (projected) in order to be back in control. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.64  
 Demand- 424.49 -> 435.23

A very impressive drop here on NQ down to the daily 20ema support and demand area of 17856. This is a major support area that bulls must defend. We did see daily sellers come back in to NQ today too which is one of the biggest drops from daily buyers to sellers since 2/16 into 2/20. 

Bulls need to find a major daily double bottom bounce here to then retest and close over daily 8ema resistance of 18040 (projected) to be back in control.

Bears have a chance to retest previous demand/ support of 17579 with these new daily sellers coming in if tomorrow they can close us under daily 20ema support of 17888 and daily demand of 17857. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18335

I think the most impressive thing is the fact that the 10YR and DXY both sold off with markets today. The 10YR took a major drop back to 4.151% demand and closed below this level for the first time since 2/7/24. 

With this closure below 4.151% there is a high probability that we could see the 10YR head back to previous demand/ support of 3.863%. The one thing I am watching is that JPOWs testimony tomorrow almost certainly will touch on rate hikes and the feds projection for 2024 and 2025 so I expect the 10YR to have a ton of volatility tomorrow.

US 10YR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.315%  
 Demand- 3.863 -> 4.151 -> 4.226%

The dollar barely lost its multi-week long range of 103.775-104.147 today. With a closure below that we could be looking at a more major breakdown to 103.026. 

The one thing I am noticing those is that the daily 50ema (green line) did not break once again. Bulls have not been able to close the dollar below that level since 2/1/24. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.147

I felt today was an important day to include the VIX as I found it very interesting as you can see the VIX once again refused to make a lower low on the daily time frame. Since 12/12/23 the VIX has not made a lower low despite countless higher highs (ATHs) being made on SPY/ QQQ. 

The VIX put in a new daily demand yesterday at 13.1 which as you can see we have stacked countless demands from 12.07-13.1 now. 

We are also back over the 8/20ema and nearing that 15.54-15.85 double supply area. 

With JPOW speaking tomorrow we could see a huge move on the VIX tomorrow. I do not see a true bear case until we close and hold over 15.54-15.85 double supply area though.

What a blah day of trading. I had some issues with my trade copier (self induced) this morning on my first two plays which made me sell early. I updated it this morning and should have better checked it but I didn’t and well I ended up not being able to enter in on all my accounts I wanted to and also was entering in without brackets on accident both times. 

The short I took I let the choppiness of the 1230-130 move make me close early. I was in the play and I should have held for greater profit but we were struggling so hard to drop for almost an hour and a half that I wasn’t quite convinced bulls weren’t going to break us out. Like I said earlier I am surprised to see how easily we dropped today. There just purely was no buying at all and bears were free to easily reject. 

I liked my long EOD during power hour expecting a bounce back to the 15min 20ema but it just once again didn’t find support. At that moment we were sitting at major daily demand on both es and nq, had a new double bottom and we had weakened sellers on 5 and 15min so I really did expect us to push higher. However, amazingly we got a rejection lower again. I really cant remember a day where we never touched 15min 20ema resistance on ES and NQ. 

The 1470 you see here is from my competition account which I held a short in over night (since I expected weakness). I closed it before open and missed a casual $6000+. As of last night I was about 20th ranked so I will see how after todays bearish day how I am ranked. 

I ended up with a quick scalp during PH to get my APEX PA and one EVAL back to green (this eval got two cons on accident earlier when I had copier issues) and otherwise my evals and MFFU PA were once again flat. 

Definitely a bit of a struggle to start this week off but looking to make the most of it the rest of the week. I will take small red of big red any day of the week.

667,Chromocell $CHRO to produce the FIRST approved treatment for Erythromelalgia (Mitchell's Disease),"**About Erythromelalgia:**  
Commonly affects the feet, but may occur in the hands, face, or other parts of the body. It emerges during childhood but can also present in adulthood. EM flares are usually triggered by warmth, physical activity or stress. Many people can not tolerate any exercise, baths or showers, and some are unable to wear socks. In severe cases, the disease may lead to depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies.  
There are two types of Erythromelalgia. 

* Primary EM: Inherited or Sporadic SCN9A mutations + non genetic or uncharacterized
* Secondary EM: Related to an underlying disease, toxin or drug induced treatment

With no currently approved treatments, and off-label treatments often ineffective, $CHRO is looking to take over the majority of this new market.

676,"Powell Day 1… 3-6-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Day one of JPOW testifying played out a lot differently than anticipated. We got the overnight pump I was looking for into 10am. However, because of JOLTS data we got a negative 10am reaction to JPOW which lead to an impressive squeeze and recovery. Right up until 130pm where ES dropped 35pts and NQ dropped 150pts in an hour on seemingly no data, or news that I have been able to find. This was a very interesting day and sets up an even more unpredictable tomorrow. 

Generally in the past the first day of JPOW testifying is the trend day so being that we didn’t get that today makes tomorrow a big unknown. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7yjzxfk65smc1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea1d6309b199b9d421a8ac6cc970799d487cd40

Some interesting data brewing here from JOLTS that shows the economy may not actually be as strong as they are leading on to believe. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0i8of2275smc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6582573e7a046e703be855b38ccfa0a1fd86e2af

The most noteworthy thing about today is the fact that NYCB once again was halted to the downside. This time we are seeing NYCB attempt a stock sale in order to raise capital. As of EOD they have apparently secured an investor. 

If you remember exactly a month ago I mentioned NYCB and said that I could see regional banks continuing to be in major trouble. Today reaffirmed that statement. These regional banks are in a lot of trouble and with BTFP ending from the fed this month (I believe next week) we may see even more trouble from these banks. This is something we need to keep on our radar. The markets honestly didn’t have a big reaction to this data at all which was a bit surprising (it didn’t correlate with the 130pm dump). 

Honestly going into tomorrow this is one of the first nights in a while where I don’t have solid confidence in an overnight direction. Part of me feels that whatever caused that 130pm drop wrongfully set us up for a drop and that bulls buy this back up tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8vuwij75smc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=71093dafa090b5f8d8f4f5cef84a3a643aa5690b

Very interesting movement today in that we got the gap up I was looking for on SPY. However, we did not see daily buyers return to the market and we did not get a new daily demand. 

This doji candle sets us up for a potential reversal lower tomorrow. This very well could turn into a failed recovery here for bulls much like what happened on 2/15 to 2/16.

Bulls need to breakout and close over 512.46 with stronger buyers. That will put in a new demand which then would aid in a breakout to ATHs. 

Bears still have an opportunity to be in control but they will need to see daily sellers come in and close back under daily 8ema support of 508.05 (which is also demand). Truly though until bulls close under daily 20ema support of 503 they are not fully in control. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 512.46  
 Demand- 495.38 -> 508.05

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

I expected to see the overnight push up on ES which aided in me passing my last two EVALS from MFFU as I was long there. 

This candle structure is frankly ugly and makes it difficult to get a good gauge of direction for tomorrow. However, I am looking for this as a failed recovery/ breakout and do expect further downside. 

Bulls need to defend daily 8ema support here and more importantly defend 5072 demand. If they do that they could push to 5142 supply and attempt a breakout to ATHs.

Bears have an opportunity to take this lower here if they close under 5072 demand but more importantly if they close under 5054 which is daily 20ema support they might be in control finally. 

ES FUTURES DAILY 

Supply- 5051 -> 5142  
 Demand- 4989 -> 5072

**QQQ DAILY**

Similar play out today on QQQ and NQ. However, I find the technicals on QQQ/ NQ to be even more interesting. This morning on QQQ while we pushed to our HOD we actually never had daily buyers and in fact we actually had stronger daily sellers. I can not recall a time that we pushed green (or closed green) while having daily sellers like this. 

We almost had an inside day today but really this is just a strong failed breakout and failure to fill the gap down. Bulls are fighting around this daily 8ema support area right here. 

Bulls need to defend 435.23 demand and daily 20ema support in order to bounce back to 445.64 supply if and when buyers come back in. 

Bears have a great opportunity to take this lower here. IF we close under 435.23 demand tomorrow I would anticipate a flush to the daily 50ema support area/ demand of 424.49. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.64  
 Demand- 424.49 -> 435.23

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

Just like QQQ despite our morning push up we still had daily sellers which really from a technical standpoint is a phenomenon I have never seen before. However, we played out the drop. I still have rarely ever (if ever) seen a green day on NQ with stronger sellers. 

The bulls couldn’t defend daily 8ema support and now have a major fight on their hands at the daily 20ema support/ demand of 17857.

Bulls must bounce here, see daily buyers come back in and close back over daily 8ema resistance tomorrow to be in control. 

Bears have to bring this back under and close this time under 17857 and they have an opportunity to see the daily 50ema support/ demand area of 17579.

NQ FUTURES DAILY  
 Supply- 18335  
 Demand- 17579 -> 17857

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

The 10yr continues to be in a pretty impressive sell off here which honestly is ironic that the market is selling off with the 10YR. 

We are clearly below and turned 4.151% demand and previous support into resistance now. 

The bulls are going to target a move back to 3.863% demand. 

Bears need to find support and target a move back up and over 4.151%.

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.315%  
 Demand- 3.863 -> 4.151 -> 4.226 -> 4.244%

The dollar finally broke through the daily 50ema support of 103.707 and now is on a move back to previous demand/ support of 103.026.

Bulls need to send this below 103.026 and target the 102.32-102.447 support area from beginning of January. 

Bears have to find support and get back over the daily 50ema resistance now of 103.707. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.147  
 Demand- 103.026 -> 103.775

I am very happy to be green today but honestly I despised trading today. I was anticipating the overnight pump so I went ahead and went long on my remaining two MFFU evals to grab a quick win there before I went to bed to officially pass those evals and now I will officially have three MFFU PAs/ funded accounts. I wanted to in my MFFU PA/funded account also open a long and let it ride over night as I expected this pump but I wasn’t convinced enough with JPOW today that it would do it to burn a PA. 

The $2108.32 you see is from my competition account where I just held a long from open at 6pm last night till right about 8am. I as of last night (before today) was ranked 14th overall which is pretty great! 

I only was able to find one good trade today for a quick 2.5 points on a pullback. I attempted to long the 115pm recovery candle before that huge drop but didn’t get filled before it pumped unfortunately. After that the price action was just far too sporadic and really all over the place for me to find anything I remotely felt confident in trading. I did play the EOD squeeze up in just my EVALS trying to pass those… now only have about $230 on one and $375 on another till I pass those. 

Really these last three days I have struggled to find some solid setups that I like. Lots of squeeze and just technical-less movement that makes it hard for me to find something I like to trade. 

I am content being green and right now I am on a path to get a very large payout from numerous PAs/ funded accounts on April 1st. I once again am going slow and not in a rush. If all goes well and I can just continue small green consistent days till April 1st I should be able to pull out about $8k from various props which would be great.

I honestly, like I said I wasn’t going to, didn’t watch any of the testimonies this year as it’s a real snoozefest and I hate watching the way our government works. I did follow some tidbits though from it and one of the big things that he said today was the below statement. 

&#x200B;

If you remember yesterday the issues with NYCB this is a big deal. While I think everyone knows there is going to be issues with regional banks the fact that JPOW himself confirmed this is concerning.

Major data dropping tomorrow at 830am being the Unemployment Rate. We have seen the rate completely flat for three months in a row now right at 3.7%. The lower the UE rate the stronger our economy is… the stronger our economy is the longer and higher we can hold rates… the higher our UE is the weaker our economy is… the weaker we are the bigger the case we have for cutting rates earlier than needed. 

I expect a BIG reaction tomorrow at 830am to this data. 

Note- I am not including the 10YR and DXY in my TA anymore. I have not seen a meaningful correlation between then in well over a month or two (really since January).

We got a new daily demand today at 509.77. This now builds a really nice daily double demand/ support are from 508.05-509.77. This also was a massive bounce off the daily 8ema support area. One interesting thing here is the fact that despite closing over 512.46 supply and making a new ATHs we did not get new/ stronger daily buyers. This makes today high “unjustified.”

Bulls need to see daily buyers return tomorrow and will attempt to close the week out at ATHs. 

Bears need to continue to weaken buyers and attempt to move us back under 512.46 supply. If they can close us back under that level we will retest the daily double demand area.

On ES here we got a new daily demand at 5090 and saw back to back days now of stronger daily buyers. We made a new ATHS and closed over previous supply/ resistance of 5142.

Bulls need to continue to defend 5142 on a backtest as support and push to and close at new ATHs tomorrow. 

Bears will need to minimally close back under 5142 supply and then target the 5072-5090 double demand area.

QQQ also got a new daily demand today at 438.8. While our daily sellers did weaken here on QQQ we did not see buyers return. The daily 8ema support was held nicely today but we could not quite break through 445.64 supply and close over that. This very well tomorrow might turn into a massive failed breakout. This would be a similar move to what played out 2/15 into 2/16. 

Bulls need to have daily buyers return and close over 445.64 to then breakout into next week. 

Bears need to defend 445.64 supply/ resistance and target a move back to 435.23-438.8 double demand area with the assist of sellers returning.

Decently similar setup here on NQ in that we got stronger daily buyers (like ES did) but we did not breakthrough and did not close over previous supply/ high of 18335. With a failure to close over that as I mentioned this looks similar to 2/15 into 2/16. However, I think tomorrows trend will be completely dependent on what the UE rate at 830am is. 

Bulls need to finally close over 18335 and target a new ATH and close in the 18400+ area. 

Bears will look to double top and drop us back into the double demand/ support area of 17857-17980 tomorrow.

Somedays you win and somedays you get slapped across the face. Today was my worst day of trading since end of January. Honestly I played myself today. I took a long around 1115 looking for the recovery which started to come and then the bond auction at 1130 sent us falling and stopped me out. After that I was in another long but things looked like they were going to drop so I flipped short and well that was a big mistake. That was some just straight nasty and ugly price action from 11-1pm on ES/ SPY. Nothing looked good after that and I just couldn’t find a good trade. 

The -8631 you see is from my competition account (no need to panic). I was actually in 8th place as of last night but I am sure I will be well below that now. I was in a long at open last night but that aggressive dumping overnight made me cut it and flip short. Little did I know I would be basically shorting the LOD. I woke up deep red and just let it run from there. I honestly didn’t think we would breakout today like we did. No harm no foul just a fun competition account. Still got three week to go too. 

I was able to pass one EVAL last night (the $231.3) you see which is great. I also failed one eval last night (I miss played it flipping long when that big dump happened before 8pm). I was able to during power hour enter a risky short on my reset account and pass another eval today though. 

Currently I have two APEX PAs, three MFFU Funded/ PAs, and I have three backup APEX evals that are passed right now and will be ready whenever I want to convert them to PAs. 

Since I have been in a bit of a meh stretch I am going to only trade my APEX PAs tomorrow and into next week till I am back in a good groove. My APEX accounts have a lot more drawdown left than the MFFU do so I have more room for cushion there. I also would rather trade just the two APEX versus three MFFU or all five together for obvious reasons until I feel solid. 

The plan remains to trade till April 1st at which time I can pull out (if all 5 accounts continue green) about $8-10k in profits. As of right now I only need to average about $200-$300/ day for all of them to hit their payday. Slow and steady wins the race. 

The trading this week just felt terrible and hard for me to find any good setups. We had tons of wicks and just candles that didn’t follow my expectations. Not blaming the market obviously or making excuses just stating this week wasn’t my ideal.

&#x200B;

RONN Inc. (OTC PINK:RONN), a pioneering technology company focused on providing sustainable transportation and fuel alternatives, proudly announced a transformative step towards carbon neutrality through an exclusive strategic agreement with NetZero, LLC. Under this agreement, Net Zero will undertake the registration, pre-sale and monetization of environmental credits on behalf of RONN.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

NASDAQ has announced their Marketplace Services Platform for Voluntary Carbon Markets and Registries where these future Hydrogen Environmental Credits will most likely trade using NASDAQ's Services Platform. Based upon the previous volume of Carbon Credits for battery EVs, experts project Hydrogen Credits will provide billions of dollars of capital into companies such as RONN in order to further advance the de-carbonization agenda. According to Shell, Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg, in 2023 alone it is expected to be $1.7B - $2.0B for Voluntary Markets expanding to a projected $250 billion by 2050, with pricing per unit expanding from $.17 to upwards of $50 during the same period.

&#x200B;

Ronn Ford, Founder and CEO of RONN (formerly Ronn Motor Group), expressed enthusiasm about the partnership stating, ""Our collaboration with Net Zero represents a significant stride towards a sustainable future. Through this management agreement, we are aligning ourselves with global efforts to support the de-carbonization agenda while unlocking immense value for our company and shareholders.""

&#x200B;

""We are thrilled to sign an exclusive agreement with RONN,"" said Bill Weathersby, Chairman of Net Zero. ""In this agreement, Net Zero will be responsible for working with several parties to establish a new hydrogen methodology in this emerging space as well as marketing and pre-selling all the environmental credits generated by RONN. We will be tapping into our global expertise to maximize the environmental and financial impact of these credits.""

&#x200B;

This landmark partnership will see RONN contributing to the global carbon offset market, specifically targeting the stationary hydrogen production sector through its new Hydrogen Hub sales. The environmental carbon offset credits generated will play a crucial role in supporting RONN's commitment to zero emission vehicle manufacturing and hydrogen production hubs.

&#x200B;

As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, RONN is taking proactive measures to make a substantial impact. By collaborating with Net Zero, a recognized leader in the carbon reduction environmental credit space, RONN aims to leverage its position in both the stationary hydrogen production sector and vehicle manufacturing to create a positive environmental legacy.

696,"Eyes on CPI… 3-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

Despite the big miss to the upside on Unemployment Rate coming in at 3.9% and a major bullish reaction the bulls were not able to hold the trend for the day. I had mentioned yesterday that I thought today was going to be similar to 2/15 into 2/16 and we actually did play out a very similar move here. 

Monday is Pre-CPI day and as of now I do expect us to see some weakness going into that data. As of the last few inflation related prints they have mostly all come in fairly hot. I will have a better analysis of CPI range and expectations Monday night. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n48p2ee9h6nc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31301793beab0918bf1802c02af78a4779d6af54

Pretty decent data week ahead. This weekend remember is daylight savings time… Sunday at 2am we will “spring forward” one hour. 

Monday is really the only day this week where there is not something major to look forward to. This week is also pre-FOMC week which thankfully means its fed speaker quiet time (they cant do interviews). I for one am incredibly sick of hearing them talk and repeat themselves over and over. 

CPI Tuesday is the major one to watch followed by PPI Thursday. 

Depending on what CPI brings Tuesday is my opinion going to push the market for the rest of the week. 

**CONTRACT ROLL**\- next Friday 3/15/24 ESH and NQH (H-based) contracts will officially expire. If you have not already done so you will need to Monday roll to an M-based contract. This is the June Expiry. I will going forward starting Monday only be trading ESM and NQM contracts and speaking of those levels. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cb0dlqt9h6nc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d53d2e9adbd7af818e2e73a36c4b93b8da5884

We closed out a really nice weekly doji here on SPY and put in a new supply at 512.93. Despite briefly seeing buyers come in last week to support the upside this is now our 3rd out of 4 weeks where buyers have weakened. Since the week of 2/5/24 we have steadily seen a weakness in buyers. 

We do remain in extreme bull momentum so in general to expect a drop through weekly 8ema support is unwise. 

Bulls are going to attempt to close over 512.93 supply next week and breakout on the backs of CPI. The target would be the top of this rising wedge resistance near 520-521. Upside remains very limited until we see a very large increase in weekly buyers which likely doesn’t come without a meaningful sell off. 

Bears need to finally break this nearly 4 month long yellow rising wedge and close under weekly 8ema support. If we closed under 500 (projected weekly 8ema support) I would expect our temporary top to be in. A closure under 497.67 weekly demand confirms the top. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 501.31 -> 512.93  
 Demand- 497.67

ES futures weekly is putting in a nice doji candle also and put in a new supply at 5142. This weekly supply actually correlated well with previous daily supply of 5142. We here on ES also did not see weekly buyers come back in. 

Bulls need to see weekly buyers come back in and push through 5142 weekly supply. If they can push through 5142 weekly supply then our target will be a breakout to the yellow rising wedge resistance of 5220 area. 

Bears need to use CPI as an opportunity to finally break the support of this 4 month long rising wedge. Breaking that support likely starts a major downfall in the market from a technical stand point. Bears ideally need to close minimally under 5014 demand and weekly 8ema support to confirm a correction is coming. 

IF bears fail next week I expect a major run up into FOMC. Which then will be another opportunity for bears. 

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5142

Going into this week I was generally far more bearish on QQQ/ NQ then I was on SPY/ Es due to the weekly/ daily resistance. 

The bears were able to put in a weekly double top off 445.94 and put a new supply in there. Much like ES/ SPY we are sitting near the peak of our rising wedge. The weekly buy here on QQQ continue to weaken and actually took one of their biggest drops in strength since 2/5 into 2/12 week. QQQ does remain in extreme bull momentum on the weekly but is starting to see a small turn down in that momentum. 

Bulls need to hold weekly 8ema support and close over 445.94 double top/ supply with stronger weekly buyers to be in control. Major breakout target is the rising wedge resistance of 445-446.

Bears have an opportunity here yet again to send this through weekly 8ema support and break the 4 month long rising wedge support. If bears can close under weekly 8ema support of 431.6 (projected) but ideally under double demand/ support of 423.1-428.26 it is pretty safe to assume the correction is coming. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.94

NQ futures also put in a weekly double top and new supply at 18324. This level correlates pretty close with the daily supply/ resistance of 18335. This 18324-18335 area is now a major level to watch on ES. We took saw a drop in weekly buying support but remain in weekly extreme bull momentum. 

Bulls need to defend this 17778 (projected) weekly 8ema support and close over 18324 weekly supply with new buyers to then breakout. Major breakout target would be the 18800 area which is the resistance of the rising wedge. 

Bears must use this window of weakness to close under weekly 8ema support of 17778 and ideally close below double demand/ support of 17460-17718. If they do I would expect a major correction down to the weekly 20ema support area near 17000.

I am only going to be included 10YR/ DXY in my weekly TA until I see a time where markets correlate with ES/ NQ to make it worth my time. 

With CPI and PPI next week we should fully expect a major move in markets. 

Looking at the 10YR here it appears a major bear flag is playing out which means the 10YR may be ready for a major leg down. We have the weekly 50ema support and demand of 4.032-4.044% as final support. If we break through and close under that level we will be targeting a drop all the way back to 3.867% area. 

4.286% remains critical resistance to watch going forward.

DXY also appears to be in a major bear flag break down right now which should lead to a large sell off back to 101.705 demand. IF we see DXY break and close under 101.705 then we will be looking at a potential move back under 100 near the 99.924 demand from July. 

To the upside we continue to see 104.088 as our critical resistance. 

Generally speaking one would expect a major bear flag breakdown on DXY/ US 10YR would likely cause a huge breakout in the markets… however the markets have been trending with DXY/ 10YR for some time now so I don’t think that correlation is valid to expect as of now.

Oil continues to trend higher and higher here. As we go into CPI this week the one thing I have noticed is the last three readings have come in higher than expectations and you can see that for the last 3 months we have been in a slow burn to the upside.

Oil still cant seen to turn the resistance at 80 into support despite numerous attempts to break out over that level. However, at the same time we can not seem to break back under that 76.57 demand area. 

In general there is a pretty impressive cup and handle forming on OIL here which certainly could lead to a big breakout back to the 100s.

This was not my best week of trading as you can see by my PnL. I just honestly struggled to find a solid entry most of the week that felt A+ to me. I also got wicked out numerous different times with this volatility. 

A great trader I know mentioned something today that I didn’t even think about. The fact that we are at ATHs is a big deal. 2 months ago a 1% day on ES mean we moved 48 pts roughly. How at ATHs a 1% day is more like 52 pts of movement. It might not seem like much but that’s an almost 8% increase in range on every candle. On Nq 2 months ago a 1% range was 170pts and now we are looing at almost 185pts… again almost 9% difference. 

The thing that really resonated with me is the fact that stop losses that used to work in that range stopped working. IF you know a month ago I switched back to ES because NQ just was swinging way too much. 10pt stops just wouldn’t do it anymore. I just never really thought about how as we push further and further into ATHs how price action like that changes. 

Today because I had a bit of a rough week (mostly yesterday) and I had my worse day in 1.5 months yesterday I wanted to take it easy today. I was just going to trade my APEX PAs together but decided to size down even more than that to be confident. I ended up turning in a great win on PA #1 today to actually (barely) put that account green for the week. My PA #2 still closed red but I got a nice EOD move there. Today felt good grabbing a total of almost 13 points over three plays. 

Going into next week I will likely pick back up on Monday trading all of my PAs/ Funded accounts. IF I have a red Monday then I will just continue to trade APEX PAs as they have the most drawdown and my APEX PA #1 is closes to a payout. 

Currently I have Three passed APEX Evals sitting waiting to be converted (I have to convert one Monday since the Monthly renews). I have two APEX PAs and three MFFU (myfundedfutures) funded accounts. Once I convert my account Monday I will then have Three APEX PAs, Three MFFU PAs and this gives me an opportunity to potentially if I can just average about $200/ day until April 1st pull out about $12k total. Slow and steady will win this race. Even if I have to go slow and steady and pull it out middle of April… that $12k payout going slow is well worth it versus rushing it and blowing all my PAs and starting over from scratch. 

Competition account- I dropped from 8th to extremely low thanks to my terrible short. The funny thing is that the drop we got today is actually exactly what I expected yesterday. I was just a day early. I almost shorted today at ATHs too but I wouldn’t have expected a 400pt drop based on open and historical trends. I am down 3600 total in that account but will look to continue to tick away as we go forward. The month has a lot to go.

711,New progress in Brain-computer interface research: Implantable interface may empower patients act on their own," 

Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology development and application landing to welcome new progress. Recently, the team of Capital Xuanwu Hospital and the team of Tsinghua University Medical School jointly announced that through the implanted epidural electrode, patients with paraplegia can achieve brain control functions such as drinking water, with a grasp accuracy of more than 90%.

After three months of home rehabilitation training, the patient can currently drive pneumatic gloves by EEG activity, and the patient has improved SCI clinical scores and sensory evoked potential measures. This development indicates that BCI technology has gradually moved from laboratory to clinical application, laying the foundation for widespread application in the future.

**technical breakthrough**

As we all know, brain-computer interface is currently a rapidly developing field, which involves a long industrial chain and is driving the rapid development of emerging markets such as cochlear implant and humanoid robot. Minsheng Securities believes that the brain-computer interface has both software layer and hardware layer. The EEG acquisition equipment in the hardware layer includes electrodes and BIC chip; the software layer includes biological signal analysis and core algorithm.

At present, the brain-computer interface core technology and market application are in the initial stage of expansion. China has certain advantages in core device design and other aspects, and is expected to achieve curve overtaking in some directions with the policy tilt, resource support and the efforts of all parties.

From the perspective of industry, the future is promising, and the global market is expected to reach $3.7 billion in 2027. Just as for the Chinese market, according to the special report of qubits, by 2040, the comprehensive market size of the brain-computer interface industry is expected to exceed 120 billion yuan, and the direct market size may exceed 50 billion yuan.

**Listed companies are investing in research and development**

The huge market prospect also attracts many capital and enterprises to enter. A number of venture capital institutions have rushed to advance the layout, enterprise layout, Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and other technology giants have been involved in the field of brain-computer interface.

In addition, although the brain-computer interface industry chain is still in the development stage, but there have been many listed companies began to try to layout in related fields. For example, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), the world’s leading AI vision enterprise, has explored the field of intelligent human-computer interaction, and has breakthrough technology patents, successfully integrating vision-computer interface (V-BCI) into the holographic glasses interaction system, creating a more efficient and immersive related brain-computer interface application.

The traditional human-computer interaction mainly relies on gestures, voice and other input methods, and has made a major breakthrough in human-computer interaction, but there are still shortcomings in the intuitiveness and efficiency of user experience. According to the introduction, the V-BCI technology developed by WiMi Hologram Cloud enables direct communication between the brain and the computer system, so that users can control the human-computer interaction content in a more intuitive and efficient way.

At present, the understanding of brain-computer interfaces is constantly improving, promoting the realization of the rapid development of the industry. While WiMi Hologram Cloud integrates visual and brain-computer interfaces that allows users to interact in a more intuitive and efficient way, this is a technology that will lead to a variety of new application scenarios.

Specifically, in the medical field, quickly check patient information to improve surgical efficiency; in the education field, students can interact with virtual subjects through EEG signals to enhance the learning experience. Obviously, WiMi Hologram Cloud has developed a batch of easy-to-use brain-computer interface products, and accelerated the exploration of applications in typical fields such as education, rehabilitation, unmanned driving and virtual reality, which points out the focus and direction for the development of brain-computer interface, and expands the market potential of brain-computer interface.

**To sum up**

It’s worth noting that Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced on his social platform that brain-computer interface company Neuralink has completed the first human brain-computer interface device, which has recovered well and has detected EEG signals. It has to be said that the international and domestic science and technology news makes the concept of “brain-computer interface” increasingly translated into reality, which is exciting.

In short, the latest breakthroughs in brain-computer interface technology once again prove the power of technology. In the foreseeable future, brain-computer interfaces have opened the door to the brain world for us, and listed companies are expected to become the main force to promote the development of the industry. In the future, brain-computer interface technology may gradually realize brain-computer fusion intelligence and expand the information processing ability of human brain.",1710140496,822471,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,012e0d9c931caecbb1518c024976d758d59c29ed6756e5ac76d9854387a5e0f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1bbx58f/new_progress_in_braincomputer_interface_research/

I just wanted to share this relatively new stock that has been on my radar since Its IPO. I had talked about $CHRO's fundamentals last week and today I am going to dive into the price action of this stock. Below the chart I give my predictions on where I think this price is going if that interests you, but you should definitely add this stock to your watchlist at minimum because this company is on the verge of capturing a very large market share in a niche biomedical sector!

If 3.25 can hold this week there could be a lot of potential for this stock to make some significant strides to the upside. However, there will be resistance around $3.80 and $4 so expect corrections and pullbacks along the way. On Friday there was a flash ""crash"" of like 7% and was immediately bought up proving bullish sentiment. If there is another sharp decrease in price like this again above $3.25, this would allow for the best risk to reward ratio for getting in.Communicated Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, please do your own research!

Communicated disclaimer, nfa!

Here is some fundamental info on the actual things these companies do (I am not an expert on the science, I am merely communicating what they have/are doing lol)

**Non-Opioid Pain Management: Chromocell Therapeutics Corporation ($CHRO)**

Cromocell Therapeutics Corporation is one of the few in existence in the biotech life sciences space, focusing on first-in-class non-opioid therapeutic alternatives in treating pain. The biotech has the leading compound CC8464 intended for sodium channels (NaV), which inhibits diversified pain conditions from erythromelalgia to neuropathic pain. Here are some of the high points—its recent IPO, strategic partnerships, early positive Phase I results—that make CHRO so potentially game-changing for both investor and patient alike.

**Gamma-Delta T-Cell Therapy Revolution: TC BioPharm ($TCBP)** 

TC BioPharm is the biotechnological company producing the allogeneic Gamma-Delta T-Cell therapy for oncology indications. This is a company whose every step rebukes mediocrity—from FDA clearance of its Phase 1B IND in Acute Myeloid Leukemia to generation of interim data through its ACHIEVE trial. This technology has so far been effective and failed to show dreadful side effects and is offering a new potential to treat blood cancers and other diseases. The strong and devoted management of this company, recent successes, and the superb integrative capabilities grounded in its core proprietary technologies will put it first among peers in cell-based immunotherapy, offering new hope in the battle against cancer.

**Conclusion**

I hope this is informative to you all, and I hope you consider keeping an eye on these tickers or at least adding to a watchlist! Have a great rest of your week everyone

725,"Pre-CPI Day… 3-11-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Well today was quite the choppy day of trading as we head into the long awaited and all so important CPI day tomorrow. This is likely to move the markets in a big way tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyw5258qirnc1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5fd2dbecacacd882b03b3b3cd5d936ebff30ec2

Based off of the Bloomberg, Cleveland fed and consensus/ forecast numbers this is our expected range for tomorrows CPI. Now this one is a bit different than in the past as basically all three of them are agreeing that numbers come in unchanged. This gives us a bit more difficulty in predicting exactly where we may end up tomorrow. 

However, something we can look at to assist us is the CPI swaps (this is essentially where markets are forecasting things… similar to how they price in rate cuts/ hike expectations). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3fjd0oqirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1267cec508bff55b0fb9edf5c9539157c8ceddc3

Now when we look at the CPI Swaps you can see that they are pricing in CPI YoY at 3.18% (rounded to 3.2%) and CPI MoM at 0.46% (rounded to 0.5%). 

If we look at the last eight readings of CPI the swaps have been correct (either exactly correct or lower than actual) 5 out of 6 times. Meaning that per the waps which are pricing in 3.2% right now we actually could see 3.2 to 3.3% actual tomorrow which does fall into our expected CPI YoY range of 2.9-3.3%. 

Now looking at CPI MoM swaps actually come in at actual or 0.1% higher… meaning with currently swaps pricing in 0.5% we are likely to see 0.4% to 0.5% MoM which would come in line with our expected range of 0.2-0.6%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/07oczu4rirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0570f94ea5e55feaf0776f4340bf22d282d4a66

Taking a look at the current trends of CPI MoM and CPI YoY here… on top we have CPI MoM… as of righ tnow you can see that the last two readings came in at 0.3% and since the low of 0% in November 2023 we have not seen a drop in MoM CPI… either way per expected range and Swaps here we are likely to see another increase in the CPI MoM which markets are not going to like. It is very hard to justify any rate cuts while CPI MoM continues to rise and is in a clear uptrend. 

Now going over to CPI YoY you can see that since June 2023 dropped us from 4% to 3% into July we have not been able to break below 3.1%. Currenlty our CPI Range has been 3.1% (December 2023/ February 2023) and 3.7% (Sept 2023 and October 2023). If we get the expect 3.1% then we maintain this range and I still find it hard to believe that “JPOW will have confidence in CPI coming down to cut rates.” And if we get the 3.2% CPI YoY which shows yet again CPI is sticky and holding pleateued here there is no way JPOW can justify a cut. 

If we get CPI MoM at 0.4-0.% and CPI YoY at 3.2% I believe we could easily see a -2% to -3% day tomorrow and easily could open down 1-1.5% pre market. 

If we get CPI MoM 0.3% or lower, and CPY YoY 3.0% or lower then likely we pop 1% pre market and could see that 1.5-2% green day tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m6df18urirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a90f100a348e7d180d2378d3fe41af4f1f78c16

The last important metric we cant forget to talk about is CORE YoY. This is where I think things can become difficult for the algos and where we may see a big move both ways before we finally settle into the actual direction. Since our CORE YoY high of 5.6% in March 2023 (a year ago) we have seen steadily a year straight of declines in CORE YOY. Now the fed has at times mentioned they find CORE to be far more important than CPI YoY. If we get our expect 3.7% number tomorrow then that would show 13 months straight of decline in CORE YoY CPI and the lowest number since April 2021. There is a small chance that even with CPI YoY and MoM set to pop to the upside that we could actually see a very green day tomorrow strictly based on CORE. Now if CORE misses forecast and hits 3.8% or especially comes in above standard deviation and hits 3.9% then I would expect a very bloody day. 

For some more fun data here… CPI YoY has come in HIGHER than or at forecast 5 out of the last 6 readings (with only 1 of those being at forecast). This gives fairly high odds we see 3.2% YoY tomorrow. 

CORE YoY has also come in HIGHER or at forecast 5 out of 6 times too (with only one being at forecast). This also gives fairly high probability of minimally 3.8% CORE YoY.

MY PREDICTION  
 CPI YoY= 3.2%  
 CPI MoM= 0.5%  
 CORE YoY= 3.8%  
 CORE MoM= 0.4%

Analysts missed in a major way last time… lets see if anyone gets it right this time… Goldman was the only one that was close last time I believe. 

The last thing to factor in here is the fact that markets have “been saved by the bell” repeatedly the last 4 months. Meaning that we have come to nearly identical turning points like this where we are sitting on EMA support and have a trend set up to sell off only for some sort of data point, new or earnings to save us and pump this market to new higher ATHs. Is this time different? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zplphapsirnc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=04252d8b97b73f85c5092ae0072f992ec9dc367d

Markets currently are pricing in 4 rate cuts by the EOY 24 still. IF we get the hot (or even unchanged) CPI tomorrow I would be shocked to not see markets pull back on the number of cuts and I also would expected them to start pricing first rate cut into July instead of June 2024. Now if we get a at forecast or by some miracle a lower than forecast likely we could see markets even attempt to price in a May cut. 

The thing that really is going to matter is FOMC next Wednesday where we will get the dot plot. This dot plot is going to paint the updated fed expecations of rate cuts/ hikes by EOY 24. I think something that is not on markets radar right now is that if CPI does indeed plateau here or even worse if it bounces back out of our range YoY wise we could seriously begin talks of rate HIKES not rate cuts by EOY… after all the economy is so strong right now it would be hard to not justify further hikes… at least until something breaks. 

NOTE- keeping TA brief today… also my TOS contracts on futures have officially rolled… I do NOT adjust my supply/ demand levels because despite contract rolls my levels always hold true. It may take a few days but eventually they will hold true and matter again. Todays contract roll up does mess with futures daily chart slightly so main focus is on SPY/ NQ right now until we make it through CPI day tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g9v0459tirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2bfca1e3e465ee4f7b610565db4cff5960dc31f

Now most interesting is that we actually had stronger daily sellers for back to back days here on Spy. However, we defended the daily 8ema support very well. 

From a technical perspective this sets up a major reversal off 8ema support and double demand support of 508.05-509.77 to push back to ATHs. 

If CPI comes in bullish we will look for 514.82. Daily close over that and likely we target new ATHs and a move of 520-525 by EOW. 

If CPI comes in bearish I would expect a closure under daily double demand of 508.05-509.77. If we close under 505.6 (daily 20ema support) then I would start to target a move back to the 495.38 demand area. -2% day puts us around 501.5 area. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 514.82  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4o8fqootirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a760ff0c58f3c5bf87adab290db744bc143e8c

Remember TOS rolled up the contract to June so there is a big descrepency in how candles look on futures here. Because of this contract roll we actually did get a new daily demand at 5114 and did make a new ATHs. It is worth noting that we did NOT have daily buyers to justify todays push up (or lack of drop I should say). 

Bulls will target a move up to 5225-5250 tomorrow on a cool CPI.

Bears will target a move back under 5090-5114 demand/ support if CPI comes in Hot. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158  
 Demand- 5072 -> 5090 -> 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5lmh4gxirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=37eb3f8da3dcae5fbeffdaf0e2a1a7e097ff3fd5

Similar here on QQQ we have for the second day in a row stronger sellers. We also had our 5th day of sellers in a row too which is the longest amount of time with sellers since January 2nd to January 8th. We held the daily 20ema support well and are holding inside the double demand/ support of 435.23-438.8. This doji candle here is what I would also call a bullish reversal to the upside candle especially bouncing off daily 20ema support. 

Bulls will target a move here up to backtest 445.64 supply/ resistnace. 

Bears will target a move to close under 435.23 demand to then target a bigger move back to 424.49.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.64  
 Demand- 424.49 -> 435.23 -> 438.8

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zrpd90tuirnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee82707984017c7999a46b9a5f9f24fe633ca84c

NQ also got a contract roll here but it effected the daily chart far less than it did on ES. 

We did get a new daily demand here on NQ at 18058. However, we actually are holding under our double supply area of 18256-18335. Our effective range here on NQ is 17980-18058 support and 18256-18335 resistance. We had a very large increase in daily sellers today so I actually am very surprised to see NQ hold as well as it did. 

Bulls will look to close over 18335 tomororw and target a move to the 18500 area. 

Bears need to close minimally under 17980-18058 but ideally under 17857 to start the next leg down to 18264-17579 area. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18256 -> 18335  
 Demand- 17579 -> 17857 -> 17980 -> 18058 

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4v1e6z9virnc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=02be3b5f876e78e7760d1d75af058d75e115b974

VIX was a big mover today and honestly has one of the most interesting daily setups heading into tomorrow. 

If we go back to previous CPI day we actualy had a similar breakout and rejection off this 15.85 supply. On 2/21 we put in a new daily supply at 15.54 and todays candle body resistance sits directly on that supply. This makes a nearly perfect double top off 15.54. 

If we didn’t have data tomorrow I would honestly be looking to go long over night as we would almost certainly see the VIX reject here and drop back into the 13s which of course would uplift the market. 

I am not really sure what caused the VIX to spike 8% this morning but they slowly sold it off all day long into close which of course allowed markets to recover. Now have see see rejection candles like this on the VIX not matter because of data? Absolutely, however this makes it a bit difficult going into tomorrow. Truly I wanna be a bear because the data just isnt good but knowing the last four months in this market I wouldn’t be surprised if they shake off a hot CPI.

Today just straight ate me up. I expected we could see some chop going into CPI today but this was a special kind of brutal price action. All three of my shorts that got stopped out had literally everyting I could ever want to see to go short and make it a high probability set up. They just unfortunately this time failed. 

My first two shorts saw profits before they hard reversed out of no where and unfortunately both of them I adjust my stop loss back up expecting some chop but general trend continuation which led to a bigger loss for me. 

Honestly I followed my plan and my strategy today and it just didn’t get it done. Nothing you can do there when your setup fails. But its part of trading. Not everyday will be green and not every day will you be able to profitably trade your strategy. All of my losses today were stopped out on some sort of wild 5min reversal that then came right back down the very next candle. Brutal trading this type of price action. 

I look forward to tomorrow and CPI day bring some better quality price action. Today seemed extremely artificially held up. Clear breaks in support and technical support to sell off on countless occasions to only find a reversal out of no where. 

Definitely not how I wanted to start my week but time to grind it out and get back to green and close out a profitable week. My MFFU PAs are coming into their EOD drawdown here unfortunately by my APEX have plenty of room to go still. 

On a positive note my competition account had a nice day holding short overnight and then playing a few what I thought was the tops on nq and selling timely. 

The slow grind continues with plans to take a payout on April 1st todays red day changes nothing.

730,Uranium Mining Play - DD & Trade Setup,"Morning all! I LOVE a uranium play and once I caught my eyes on this one, I couldn’t not share. Communicated disclaimer , nfa. Beloe you will find a trade opportunity (entry and targets) as well as some DD! 

Enjoy!

**Introduction**

ATHA Energy Corp. ($SASKF). Is one of Canada's premier uranium exploration companies, ATHA is not just another name in the vast mining sector. It's a harbinger of massive growth potential in 2024. But why, you ask? Let's delve into the atomic core of ATHA Energy and unearth the elements of its luminescent appeal.

**Overview**

ATHA Energy and Latitude Uranium to Merge, Creating a Top Force in Uranium Exploration. ATHA is not only preparing its way for growth coupled with exponential expansion but is also having in its possession world-class exploration and strategic land positions, complemented by a treasury that has over C$65 million. A tale of record exploration strength combined with a dominant multi-basin land position and a team with influence that is international.

**Financials**

With a firm cash reserve, ATHA carries out its exploration activities at the proper financiers. With a blend of economic power and a recent merger, it can go for evaluation which is capable of rocketing its valuation.

**Trade Opportunity**

Boasting a public float of about 160M shares, ATHA Energy has recently caught the market's eye, hinting at an accelerated trajectory toward its vast growth horizon. It's a picturesque scene of strategic market positioning, where beautiful periods of consolidation intermingle with dynamic forays into crucial supply/demand areas. Within this landscape, we navigate four primary battlegrounds, currently perched atop the foundational zone with robust support beneath us. Should the dance of price and volume lead us to breach the $0.75 mark, we're in a good position for a meteoric ascent past $1.40, charting into unprecedented highs

*KEY LEVELS*

Entry: $0.69

Target 1: $0.7490 (+8.55%)

Target 2: $0.8414 (+21.74%)

Target 3: $0.9102 (+31.91%)

Target 4: $1.00 (+44.93%) 

Bonus: $1.40+ (+102.90%)

**Interesting Info**

This places ATHA at the cusp of more than just groundbreakers; they are digging for a future where clean energy leads the way. Holding the largest cumulative exploration package in the Athabasca Basin, ATHA stands amidst one of the world's most important uranium hotspots, stretched right across to the Thelon and Central Mineral Belts. With a public float of around 160 million shares, ATHA is perched on the edge of a titanic opportunity in what remains evident through some highly strategic exploration and intra-market domination.

**Reasons to Consider ATHA Energy Corp.**

* Strategic mergers: The recent merger with Latitude Uranium now puts the firm in the position of being the world's leading uranium exploration company, ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow's energy appetite.
* ATHA Financial Fortitude: With more than C$65 million cash on hand, ATHA is in a fit financial position to do justice to its elaborate exploration plans.
* Geological Goldmine: With jaw-dropping discoveries unfolding just at the doorstep of the world's highest-grade uranium districts, ATHA presents a true geological goldmine, forming an unrivaled value proposition with exploration torque like no other.

734,"Market Shrugs Off Hot CPI… 3-12-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Surprised by todays market reaction? This is a brutal reminder to those of you that love to play data, earnings, etc. You can be absolutely correct and still be wrong. What I mean is I expected that data would come in hot and I even nailed it only being off on CPI Mom by 0.1% and we still got a different reaction than expected. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w2e9a2r1qync1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f4deb85c61a423ee0e0660b02dfa18587e294e3

There are a few things that I am seeing being thrown around for why we did what we did today. The best explanation I can agree with is that IV and volatility had such an incredible move priced in that once they dumped the VIX it was all over. They just had too big of a move expected to sell us off. Too many people deep in puts. What is the truth? Who knows. 

But like I said in my TA last night from a technical perspective going into today we had a massively bullish move set up which did play out today. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m4wz5s82qync1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=9803713067ed5d04d197a9eff864df8785920827

Looking at the projected fed funds rate market is surprisingly holding steady that our first rate CUT comes in June 2024. However, markets has pulled back from four expected rate cuts to now expecting three rate cuts. Next Wednesday we have FOMC meeting where with this hot CPI data and previous PPI data I would be very surprised to see the fed hold to three rate cuts. The DOT Plot we are going to get very well could show 1 or two rate cuts by EOY or none… markets likely could continue to rally into FOMC which will once again be the bears next opportunity to drop us lower. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c2kwasl2qync1.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c3bc75ad455fb4f3f4a95c72a66557c3aba5074

Going into tomorrow… 6 of the last 6 and 8 of the last 9 CPI days have opened green… 5 of the last 6 and 7 of the last 9 have also closed green. 

One last friendly reminder as people like to call me a permabear for some reason… there is no reason to short this market (long term, outside of a daily pullback) unless we close and hold below the daily 20ema support.  

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k5p0ie33qync1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=878969b80f8483583de1716dee7db8cfc85f1084

Despite the quick flash down opening hour we put in the bullish days that technicals supported. 

With a bounce here we got a new demand at 510.37 and after two days of sellers now have buyers back on the market. With a closure over previous supply/ resistance of 514.82 we are now free to see a new ATHs this week. The last two days of price action would suggest that ES/SPY are leading this rally upwards not NQ/ QQQ. 

Bulls are going to look to continue this support bounce off the daily 8ema and breach ATHs with a target of 520-525. 

Bears will need to find a double top rejection tomorrow to send this back under 514.82 supply to then test our triple demand/ support area of 508.05-510.37.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 514.82  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t9ybmuk3qync1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ac56ab94e9abd894eb906aeab526eeaef9f8cf7

On ES here its very similar in that we do have a nice breakout here. Now of course the candle structure is way different due to contract roll but again that will normalize into EOW. 

Bulls will now target a bigger breakout to 5260 with the help of daily buyers and also now re-entering extreme bull momentum.

Bears need to find resistance and double top us with hopes of retesting the daily 8ema support near 5158.

ES FUTURES DAILY  
 Supply- 5158  
 Demand- 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n019k5y3qync1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dee61787ea249a88db8971965ac6e48329b2bc6

QQQ actually still has daily sellers right now (though they did weaken) but with 6 days of sellers we are seeing the longest amount of sellers since the last two weeks of October (yes right when this rally started). 

With a bounce off daily 20ema support and closing over daily 8ema support we have put in a new demand at 437.31 which gives us major double demand support at 435.23-437.31.

Bulls have not quite gotten through 445.64 supply which is a double tested supply. We confirmed that as supply/ resistance on 3/1 and 3/7. 

Bulls need to break through that supply level and then its pretty clear sailings to ATHs. However, bulls need to see buyers return to the markets. 

Bears have an opportunity to reject here with us still having sellers (though they weakened) on the daily timeframe. Critical support is the double demand at 435.23-437.31 which bears will need to close below. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.64  
 Demand- 435.23 -> 437.31

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rror0ac4qync1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f675c00923b06d1efa0fbb9cd3fbc7a2360f886e

Now on NQ here due to contract roll we have broken through that critical double supply of 18256-18335. However, we also did not see buyers return to NQ which makes today breakout slightly concerning. 

Bulls need to see daily buyers come back in to support further upside which will target 18600-18700 area. 

Bears could reject here with a nice double top and bring back in daily sellers. If that happens they will be targeting a move back to 18256-18335 which is where the daily 8ema projected will be. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY  
 Supply- 18256 -> 18335  
 Demand- 18058

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke7nbxo4qync1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e58a5c63faeb5de3991cdbdba2a23846121ad80

Looking back at it the VIX called this move… with the VIX yesterday hard rejecting off 15.54-15.85 double supply and already being at the previous 4 months high/ resistance it makes sense that we got sold off on the VIX today. However, it is slightly surprising that we didn’t see a more bearish reaction and didn’t see markets panic a little from that CPI read. I still honestly think that CPI read is going to change everything for FOMC and that markets are playing dumb right now. But at this rate honestly it’s a bull market and bull markets gonna bull until something breaks in a big way… when that black swan event comes people wont be able to sell fast enough. 

With this rejection here we officially reconfirmed 15.54 as supply/ resistance. The VIX will now look to make a bounce off the 13.1 demand area into EOW. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejntvsa5qync1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbafb04d675a10b2c7fe31f830cb123f89516cd

After having a larger than ideal red day and after having a day that I would say didn’t go as planned (my own fault) I like to rethink my strategy and what I am doing. My goal is obviously to take as large of a payout from my 6 PAs/ Funded accounts as possible. However, at the same time recognizing the last week to two of price action in this markets has been (For me at least) brutal and at times just down right untradeable. 

While I would love to trade all six PAs to get the largest payout possible I also have to be conscious of not risking all the props and losing them all at once. Currently my APEX PAs one is near 1k profits and the others are just barely in the red. But these accounts because of the trailing drawdown of 2500 have the most drawdown available. My MFFU accounts are all just barely in the red but have the least amount of drawdown available. 

I only traded my MFFU accounts today. My MFFU accounts have to be traded minimally once a week while on APEX I have no penalty for not trading them. My plan is for now to continue to trade just my MFFU accounts and bring those back into profits and revive my full drawdown. At the time where I feel I am back in a good stretch ill throw APEX back in there too. But for now the goals gonna be to focus on these MFFU. IF I happen to lose these accounts which essentially two very bad days would do that then I will switch to my APEX PAs and work on those getting paid out. 

Again in the end the goals to get paid out and having to completely restart every PA from an EVAL takes a lot longer than going way slower on my current PAs to preserve them. 

Todays price action was honestly unbearable to trade. I did not expect to see a 40pt drop at open to then recover nearly 60pts within an hour after words. The opening 2 hours were beyond volatile. I was able to find one nice long off the 1pm support bounce. Outside of that today honestly nothing remotely even looked good to trade. 

Its funny because this market used to give me 7-10 solid setups a day to trade and now somedays I feel I am barely finding 2-3 setups that I feel are A+ (per my criteria).

744,AGBA Group is Positioned For Hong Kong's Rebounding Macro Environment with Business Refinements and Growth Strategies,"The year 2023 posed significant macro-economic challenges for Hong Kong and China, particularly in relation to the Chinese real estate and financial markets. As an open economy heavily reliant on tourism, exports, and financial markets, Hong Kong faced a difficult year.

&#x200B;

However, there are now emerging signs of a recovery in the macro environment for both China and Hong Kong. The annual Chinese New Year celebrations in Hong Kong this year witnessed a record number of visitors from Mainland China, indicating an upswing in spending, including on financial products and services. Alongside these cyclical tailwinds, Hong Kong is experiencing structural growth driven by demographic factors and the increasing demand for its products and services from the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

&#x200B;

AGBA Group Holding Limited (“AGBA” or the “Company”), the leading one-stop financial supermarket in Hong Kong, is strategically positioned to capitalize on Hong Kong's return to growth. The challenges faced in 2023 prompted successful changes to AGBA's business model, resulting in increased focus and efficiency. The implementation of significant cost-cutting measures is expected to reduce normalized operating expenses to a level for strong growth and profitability.

&#x200B;

With its enhanced and streamlined business model, AGBA is well-prepared for growth in 2024. Growth will be further supported by the recent securing of substantial funds through a successful equity private placement in February 2024, in addition to completing and planning asset sales of non-core activities.

&#x200B;

These strategic initiatives have positioned AGBA as a formidable player in the market and facilitated the establishment of exciting and successful new partnerships. These collaborations are anticipated to further enhance AGBA's growth potential and consolidate its position as an industry leader.

&#x200B;

Various factors contributing to a substantial decline in AGBA's share price since its listing on Nasdaq in 2022. There now exists a notable disconnect between the current share price and the underlying business value. Given the improved macro environment and the growth prospects stemming from AGBA's refined business model, closing this valuation gap presents significant upside potential for existing and new shareholders.

&#x200B;

Mr. Wing-Fai Ng, Group President, AGBA Group Holding Limited said “We have actively adapted to the changing landscape and taken bold steps to position ourselves for growth. Our efforts to streamline operations and forge strategic partnerships have strengthened our position in the market. As we look ahead to 2024, we remain singularly focused on capturing growth while containing operating costs. Furthermore, we are optimistic about the potential realization of our expansion to Singapore, following our clients' footsteps, this year”

746,"Chop Into PPI… 3-13-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

I have seen some pretty painful and choppy trading days but today gave Mondays pain a run for the money. No one wanted to be in control for more than about 5 minutes at a time. We also saw tons of divergence between SPY/ QQQ and even between short term timeframes such as the 5 and 15min and the daily timeframe. Today was brutal and makes me think markets are waiting for PPI tomorrow to make their move. After the “bullish” move yesterday on the back of hot CPI today was anything but bullish. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ncj4rmcww5oc1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d1c12e1454da23afb1bf0295d669bf9885624a6

Taking a look at the expectations for PPI tomorrow we are setting up an interesting move. As of right now CORE PPI (arguably the most important measure) is forecasted to come in at 0.2% which would be the first decrease in CORE PPI in 4 months. As you can see CORE PPI was flat at 0% for three months before last month taking a massive bounce to 0.5%. With CPI also bouncing this is very important to watch tomorrow. As of right now if we get a PPI higher than 0.5% tomorrow I would expect a pretty impressive meltdown. The bulls may be able to justify a pump if we see CORE PPI below 0.5% but anything under 0.2% would be extremely bullish. 

Looking at PPI we are also seeing a 4 month long bounce here too. Current forecast comes in at 0.3% which is also previous PPI. A measure of 0.4% or higher with an upside miss on CORE PPI will likely be received extremly negatively. A measure of 0.2% or below with a lower than previous CORE PPI could lead to another breakout like we saw on CPI day.

Taking a look at SPY here after the breakout over previous supply yesterday we did come back down and backtest that support. The support of 514.82 did hold today but we did not holding onto daily buyers today and could not breakout to new ATHs. 

This hanging man candle actually has a way of being a bearish reversal candle here so I would look for some downside tomorrow. 

Bulls need to double bottom tomorrow and hold this 514.82 supply as support with a target of 518.22 being ATHs. 

Bears need to close back under 514.82 supply to put in a new supply near 517.16 and target a retest of daily 8ema support near 513 (projected).

 Supply- 514.82

On ES futures here we actually did see stronger daily buyers today despite the red day (certainly a phenomenon). We have a really nice daily double top with this hanging man candle at 5239. We did not manage to get a new supply just yet though. 

Bulls need to push through this 5239 double top and seek out a closure near or over ATHs of 5247.5.

Bears need to drop us tomorrow to turn the 5239 double top into a supply. They then would seek out a backtest of daily 8ema support near 5190 (projected). 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158  
 Demand- 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lvwflfdxw5oc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=676b05c8f6084ba8a036226f3eea87a22f7cecf0

Yesterday I mentioned that with QQQ failing to break through that 445.64 double tested supply that I saw tech being much weaker than ES and expected it could hold us back today. We saw that play out perfectly with NQ/ QQQ once again being the laggard and weak link. 

Daily sellers here on QQQ once again returned stronger and now market the most days of sellers in a row since end of October. With a new daily supply at 443.69 we now look for a backtest of previous double demand/ support at 435.23-437.31. 

Bulls need to defend daily 8ema support here and push through and close over double supply of 443.69-445.64.

Bears need to backtest daily 20ema support near 437.1 and ideally close below daily double demand/ support of 435.23-437.31.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 435.23 -> 437.31

We got the daily double top on NQ that I was looking for yesterday and we even day daily sellers return to the market today again. With a new daily supply at 18473 we will look at that to be top. 

Bulls need to double bottom off daily 8ema support near 18256 supply and push back to and preferably over 18473 supply/ resistance.

Bears of course have a window of opportunity here to backtest the triple demand area of 17857-18058. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18256 -> 18473  
 Demand- 17857 -> 17980 -> 18058

Straight painful price action today… ES spending most of its day consolidating in a tight choppy range. Honestly if you successfully traded today I give you major props. 

I went short expecting an EMA rejection and found myself about 1 point and one candle too early on my short which eventually would have paid out. 

Ended up looking long shortly after that and never quite made it to my 5 point target. This time I set an early BE under previous candle support and was stopped out. I had missed almost a full point or 2 off my initial entry because if poped so fast off support that made all the difference too. 

I just could not find a play that made sense and we were filled with so many dojis and wicky candles that it was for most of the day untradeable. I am content that I only took a small red day today. Not much I can do honestly with chop and tight ranges like that. Appears that markets are waiting for PPI tomorrow. 

I hope for some better continuation and price action tomorrow but I certainly will not hold my breadth.

755,Apple accelerated the acquisition of AI startups; WiMi explores AI core applications," 

Apple (AAPL) is preparing to acquire a private artificial intelligence startup that anonymizes private data in images, according to tech media reports.

In this AI-driven era, AI changes images, rather than blur processing, to anonymize faces and data. This makes the final image look more natural, and makes the blur look like a primitive approach to the problem.

 

https://preview.redd.it/okadnvgnb9oc1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f76ee5e1bdeefa7e98c51db81ea6460426c19aa

According to industry sources, Apple plans to acquire Brighter AI and use its technology in its products. The company’s Vision Pro VR / AR headsets may be the first product to benefit from the technology.

Recently, Apple CEO Tim Cook said: ” I think there is a huge opportunity for generative AI and AI, but I don’t want to give more details.”This raises expectations for Apple’s future strategy in AI.

Count down, artificial intelligence is not only a tuyere, but also the key to open the door of the future. The rapid development of ai general large model represented by ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention. This stage covers both positive changes and challenges that need to be seriously addressed.

**The AI enterprises are waiting for opportunities**

AI has a large market scale and rich application scenarios, which provides a broad space and conditions for the landing application of large models. In addition to Nvidia (NVDA), traditional chip hardware makers are also focusing on AI.

Including Intel (INTC), qualcomm (QCOM), chip giant also have action, especially Intel action quickly, not only can accelerate the AI video and image generated game GPU, and released a variety of generative AI tools and services, such as large model reasoning open source, can use generative AI automatically create virtual game NPC service, etc.

General artificial intelligence is approaching, large models are multi-modal, and AI agents are expected to become the next generation platform. In the future, with the accelerated integration of digital interaction engine and AI and other technologies, more super digital scenes will be created to help the digital real integration to a new height.

 

**WiMi seized the key to the future**

A new round of artificial intelligence (AI) boom is coming, and it is understood that WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) has put forward new requirements for ai development goals on this new track. We will vigorously cultivate AI cross-industry and cross-field scene business, expand the core industries of digital economy, and strive for artificial intelligence, human-computer interactive robots, driverless cars, and intelligent education. These “sophisticated” products will enter people’s attention, and let more people feel the changes of The Times brought by artificial intelligence.

According to the introduction, seizing the unique opportunity of AI, WiMi uses advanced AI vision, large language model and natural language processing technology to perfectly simplify the complexity of virtual space, and gradually realize cross-industry and cross-scene applications. This enables the AI digital interaction engine to continuously realize technological iteration in the process of efficiently building the virtual world and high-quality interaction with the real world, leading enterprises to combine vertical expertise with these new tools, and further explore higher freedom in the AI world.

Because of its cutting-edge technology innovation, accurately cultivating the industry and effectively enabling the business, WiMi is actively giving play to its own advantages and building a characteristic AI-driven new track to cultivate the future industry. In the future, WiMi will further strengthen the development of Al business-based landing, promote the agglomeration of related industries and elements through cooperation and joint construction, improve the construction of industrial clusters to form a linkage effect, and ultimately strongly promote the high-quality development of artificial intelligence industry.

**To sum up**

In addition, in terms of creating new market demand, AI super assistant, AI robots and other demands are also constantly created. Industry insiders believe that the combination of software and software is of great significance to the development of AI application, and it is the key area to break in the next stage of AI. This also means that everything can be AI, from home goods to transportation, from educational equipment to the services industry, which can be combined with AI.

The extensive integration of AI and physical objects will bring more convenience and possibilities to everyone’s life. Turning virtual into real and transforming AI into tangible consumer products can benefit everyone. This is a qualitative leap. The imagination space of AI hardware and software combination is infinite, which will be a long-term learning process for AI. In short, 2024 will be the first year of the outbreak of AI, and I hope that more access and landing scenarios can be born in the future.",1710403476,822645,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,6f01c2b07f5ef3b396383f7deb846aad57aee0f14352c7d87f356f3716e7f570,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1beg1g7/apple_accelerated_the_acquisition_of_ai_startups/

If the Merger Agreement is approved by Aptorum’s and YOOV’s shareholders (and the other closing conditions are satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement), and upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the ""Closing"", and the date of the Closing, the ""Closing Date""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptorum organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (""Merger Sub"") will merge with and into YOOV (collectively, the ""Merger"").

&#x200B;

In addition, on March 1, 2024, Aptorum, its major shareholder, Jurchen Investment Corporation (""Jurchen""), which is controlled by Ian Huen, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Aptorum, and Aptorum Therapeutics Limited (""ATL""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptorum have entered into a split-off agreement (the ""Split-Off Agreement""). Pursuant to the Split-Off Agreement, Aptorum will assign and transfer the assets and liabilities of its legacy business to ATL, and Jurchen will acquire 100% issued and outstanding shares of ATL from Aptorum and surrender certain ordinary shares of Aptorum held by Jurchen to Aptorum (the ""Separation""). The Separation will become effective immediately following completion of the Merger. The Separation and the Merger are referred hereto as the ""Proposed Transactions."" Aptorum upon the Closing is referred to herein as the ""combined company.""

&#x200B;

Merger Consideration

&#x200B;

Upon completion of the Merger, the existing Aptorum shareholders and existing YOOV shareholders expect to own approximately 10% and 90%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the combined company. Aptorum agreed to issue Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 each (the ""Class A ordinary shares""), and Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 each (the ""Class B ordinary shares""), to YOOV’s shareholders. The total number of ordinary shares of Aptorum to be issued in the merger equals the number of aggregate fully diluted shares of YOOV multiply by the ""Conversion Ratio."" The Conversion Ratio is calculated by dividing (i) Aptorum’s outstanding Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares multiplied by nine (ii) by the aggregate fully diluted shares of YOOV.

&#x200B;

This Merger is considered to be a ""reverse merger"" because the shareholders of YOOV will own more than a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company following the Merger. As such, the Merger is subject to NASDAQ’s approval of the combined company’s initial listing application.

&#x200B;

""This transaction marks a significant milestone for YOOV Group Holding, and we are thrilled about the immense opportunities it brings. Listing on Nasdaq is a testament to our growth trajectory and we believe this will propel our company's development and expansion,"" said Phil Wong, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of YOOV Group Holding Limited.

&#x200B;

""We are pleased to announce our proposed reverse merger with YOOV Group Holding, which we believe will be in the best interest of our shareholders,"" said Ian Huen, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Aptorum Group. Mr. Huen added, ""YOOV is a promising AI-enabled software and automation platform. The merger is an exciting and important transaction that will take YOOV to listing on Nasdaq, which I believe will open further opportunities for the company to drive growth towards new heights.""

&#x200B;

764,"NREG (DD) PickleJar merger, VC-backed, been on Forbes, Fox, partnership spree, massive outreach *MUST READ*","
This is one of the best mergers I honestly ever seen in the OTC. They completed the merger with VC-backed company PickleJar. It’s a pretty cool app which I will go over. Last week they finished 2 year audit and applied for name change with FINRA so definitely keep an eye out for further updates going forward.
 
Here are some things worth noting:

•Recently announced 10M Annual ticketing contract with Imagen Entertainment

•Landing partnerships left and right even with NASDAQ listed companies $CMLS $AUID while $NREG is an OTC

•Forbes stated “Country singer Sasha McVeigh witnessed this change firsthand. Within the first three days of using PickleJar she raised $1010” you can find the Forbes article by search google “Forbes PickleJar”

•PickleJar has Multiple revenue streams (read about below)

•Raised more than $6M in funding as a private company, lead investor Anton Rabie, Canadian billionaire business man and largest shareholder and executive at Spinmaster (TOY) which trades on the Canadian Exchange


How the company generates revenue:

Key revenue drivers: Ticketing Sales, Artist Promotion, Content Subscriptions,  Advertising Revenue, Video On-Demand, Contesting Campaigns, Product Placement, Artist Payments, Ecommerce/Merch, Fan Subscriptions

Ticketing Sales: PickleJar ticketing platform gives Venues pricing and payment flexibility. Company generates revenue at a per ticket price or percentage of face value of the ticket as negotiated with the Venue, promoter, or brand sponsor.

Venue Listing and Performance Discovery: Fees are derived from advertising and promotion of local venues and their on-stage performances.

Merchandise and Product Sales: The PickleJar platform allows both artists and third-parties to sell their products on the platform to create personal and product economic impact. PickleJar charges a transaction fee to consumers or generates a per sale commission for each purchase made.


Also the company is really getting the name out there through artists promoting them and constant partnerships. For example, PickleJar is partnered with large media company (NASDAQ: $CMLS) for a daily Country radio program called (PickleJar Up All Night) which airs across CMLS’ Country stations in 47 US markets reaching over millions of people every month. 

PickleJar is also partnered with Cox Media Group (CMG) which delivers 14 television stations in 9 markets, 49 radio stations in 10 markets, streaming and digital platforms, as well as local, regional, and national advertising businesses. These partnerships could act as an attraction point for artists to start using PickleJar – increasing its popularity in turn.”

In addition to that, PickleJar is also partnered with partnered with authID (NASDAQ: $AUID) to combine artist payments and ticketing services with Biometric Identity Verification.

More recent partnerships:

• ReachTV, the largest streaming television network targeting travelers, announced a partnership with PickleJar, the leader in unified live entertainment technology, that will bring greater visibility to PickleJar artists, podcasters, and content partners to over 50 million Nielsen-rated monthly viewers.

• PickleJar and Polywell Computers sign multi-year partnership to design and manufacture computing products for venues.

• PickleJar and Imagen Entertainment sign mult-yeas ticketing deal to expand simple and secure payments to fans. $10M annual contract 

• PickleJar and Eye On Channel launch strategic partnership to co-develop new premium content and branded entertainment 

• PickleJar and Knocking Inc forge dynamic E-Commerce partnership

The company has also made appearances on TV on multiple occasions. I attached posted a video clip on Twitter from Fox News with American Idol winner, Trent Harmon crediting the app.

What makes the stock even more interesting is the current market cap of 2M. This is literally a NASDAQ quality company trading in the OTC.

Would love to hear everyone else’s feedback on this one.

765,"Quad Witching Day… 3-14-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

As expected you can see below that we did indeed get a hot PPI this morning. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ohze8rpzwcoc1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=40ba3d29b5af126906389b5d9a0dca6f35b5352e

I am not surprised that we closed red today but I am surprised that we didn’t have more of a red day than we did. This is one of those classic times that overnight futures pumped us so much that the sell off we had today looks less impressive than it is. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zsdlxz10xcoc1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d9d419b1c2583d5c5631d74ebe90ee7254d283a

For the last about month now I have been saying that despite how bullish we may be on the daily and weekly timeframe…. Trading intraday is pretty far from bullish most days. However, from a historical standpoint this is the longest markets have gone without at least a -2% drop (close) since 2018… the only other longer stretch was the years leading into 2008. And we all remember what happened in 2008. 

Tomorrow is quad witching day where we are going to get a ton of OI closed out. I am hoping that sort of fixes this choppy market we have right now. I have never seen such a uniformed range/ consolidation like we did today on ES. We bounced exactly from the same two targets for over 3 hours straight. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zmxfqff0xcoc1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c2eeca45d228f88eccae0387413ce736e9823c1

Tomorrow is quad witching day which is also dividend payment day for SPY. We will obviously see a drop on SPY due to that overnight but as you can see looking at ES (S&P500 futures) you can see that besides December 2023s quad witching day we have closed red and solidly red every quad day for almost two years straight. 

One of the things I did notice in back testing is that most of these quad days have a fairly bearish opening hour. 

Note- If you have never traded a quad witching day… friendly advice is to avoid them. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ljuipqx0xcoc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f5b443324e0f28227124a6b2bac834204b8e09

Much like I expected yesterday we did get the reversal here today and did put in a new supply at 517.05. We also have sellers returning to the daily time frame now. 

With daily 8ema support still holding there is a potential bounce here tomorrow. 

Bulls need to defend daily 8ema support and bounce back over 517.05 supply to close out the week. 

Bears need to attempt to move down to daily triple demand/ support of 508.05-510.37.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mf9yled1xcoc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb2004b9490f28f0367f92337303b2f04581566

Jumping over to ES here you can see that we got a new supply today and put in a really nice triple top oat 5238. 

We were not able to quite get back down to the daily 8ema support (due to contract roll) but we had a very large drop in daily buyers today. 

Bulls need to defend daily 8ema support and look for a move back to 5238 supply.

Bears will look to continue this move downward with our target being triple the 5158 supply. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158 -> 5238  
 Demand- 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4o9npzr1xcoc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0dc5efc5c5bebb2e35d530cd5e13e625f20485

As I had mentioned yesterday and earlier this week QQQ/ NQ looked far weaker and that played out well today again. We now have 8 days straight of selling (with today being stronger sellers) this is the first time we have seen this many days of selling in a row since October (right before this 4 month long bull run started. 

We are holding onto for dear life today at LOD the 4 month long support line for this bull channel. IF we breakdown overnight and do not gap up we are going to see this support broken.

Bulls need to defend this support here at daily 20ema and break out back over daily 8ema resistance at 439.7.

Bears need to close the week below 435.23-437.31 double demand to then target a bigger breakdown next week. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 435.23 -> 437.31

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azs8ao72xcoc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=43766fab29b3db7c0444bf7f0fa1674de8cddb4a

NQ also has stronger daily sellers today and the strongest sellers since 1/5/24. 

With out double top and supply at 18473 yesterday the bears are now seeking out a move back down to the daily 20ema support of 18058 which is also a triple demand area. 

Bulls need to defend the daily 20ema support here and look for a bounce higher.

Bears need to send this under daily 20ema and triple demand of 17857-18058 to initiate further downside. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18472  
 Demand- 17980 -> 18058

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4jy7y0q2xcoc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab3285b42b485c5403fb3557ba5212b58b39c4b

The VIX was absolutely all over the place today but in the end we are seeing a massive move up on the daily here for the VIX. With yet again another higher low/ demand being put in at 13.74. 

We now look for a double supply test of 15.54-15.85. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Today was another just painful day of trading for me. I got stopped out two different times going short before we finally broke down. Had a great long and then from there it just all went down hill. I had a long that I expected to bounce inside the range like we did all day only for us to free fall… and then we finally looked ready to continue this lower and of course got stopped short… that’s where I blew my PAs. Sometimes I wonder if I need a bigger stop loss but I also know I don’t see enough pts generally to make that worth it… I do think I need to be more aggressive in my entries as there have been numerous times I miss 1-2 pts off things trying to be patient.

I ended up opening a new 30k Static from MFFU and took a nice 8pt long to start that off. 

Tomorrow is quad witching day and usually some of the nastiest trading out there comes on any sort of option expiration day… I am going to tread lightly and just keep trading this static eval tomorrow. 

I still have a total of 5 PAs right now with APEX but this price action has (for me) been completely untradeable and I refuse to lose another PA from this price action. I am going to tread lightly here and just work on this EVAL until I feel like I am back in a good place to trade my APEX PAs.

777,"Is The Top In Heading Into FOMC? 3-15-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

Markets remain in a choppy zone here after CPI and PPI this week came in hot. We have another very big week of data next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ojp6yof4koc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79b0e195db691ce87ea0dbed770d01170da76f4c

The big things to watch this week ahead is the BOJ rate change (information below) and then of course our own FOMC meeting on Wednesday. With the BOJ meeting on Monday/ Tuesday we could see some unprecedented movement when and if that rate indeed changes. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lmeg5x2g4koc1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c0a88878f795e8ce2195da85f92f9f4f20ceb41

The Bank of Japan is considering lifting rates for the first time in years, which could have ripple effects on global financial markets.

Swaps have priced a 57% chance of a rate hike at the BOJ's upcoming meeting, significantly higher than previous odds.

Rising Japanese rates have previously had global impacts, with rates in Japan and the US rising at a similar pace.

Looking for a helping hand in the market? Members of Reading The Markets get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate.

Removing Japan's negative interest rate policy would undoubtedly indicate that the Bank of Japan acknowledges that the country's deflation risk is over and that inflation has returned. The most significant effects would be felt throughout global bond yields and currency markets.

The last time we saw rates in Japan rise sharply was over the summer, when the BOJ was tweaking its yield curve control and lifting the ceiling on its 10-year note yield. In fact, from July through September, as the 10-year rate in Japan rose, the rate on the US 10-year rose as well, almost at the same pace, with the spread between the two notes staying reasonably consistent.

What may have played a key role in global rates topping out at the end of October and sparking that massive rally in equity markets in the US and **Japan was the Bank of Japan's decision not to change monetary policy on Oct. 31**, even though there were some rumors at the time of a policy tweak coming.

The most interesting thing about the whole BOJ situation is the fact that this massive rally we have been in for almost 5 months now started on October 31st. The day that BOJ decided to not increase their rates. Coincidence? Perhaps. But it would be ironic if the top of the market is put in when the BOJ decided to rate hike finally. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zq9zifgg4koc1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=7658dbe2fb64f46e0c5ee387905cb8913dad6c99

As of right now we will get no rate hike at our meeting this Wednesday. However, the most important thing that will happen at this meeting is whether or not JPOW holds steady to 3 rate cuts by end of the year. With back to back months of inflation rising I think the fed is going to be very hard pressed to justify rate cuts in June. We have not really made any headway below 3% inflation and it has clearly become sticky. 

I would not be surprised if we see the fed pull back from 3 rate cuts (this was established in December 2023) to one maybe two rate cuts at best with the first coming likely in September if not November. 

The question will be whether or not the market believes the fed this time. 

For the last 5 months it seems like every single big data or earnings event has been an opportunity to take this market lower and to start the much over due 5-10% correction. However, as we are gonna discuss below this is the first time in 5 months going into one of these weekly events that we are starting to see faults in the weekly timeframe. Almost all of the windows of opportunity we have seen has strictly been on the daily timeframe… but this week we finally have some breaking of the bulls momentum. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjmextvg4koc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0126dcb9bc68eabaf4690b657c5480345ec814ea

Taking a look at SPY weekly here we have now once again seen back to back weeks of sellers weakening. We are starting to see the extreme weekly bull momentum turn down but continue to be firmly inside that level. After our doji top last week with a supply at 512.93 we failed to get a breakout over that level. 

In fact this is the first time in 9 weeks that SPY did not make a new weekly high (or ATHs). 

Our POC (point of control) is that 512.93 supply and resistance so now that we are holding firmly under that we should look to that as resistance. 

We are sitting on the absolutely last stand for bulls here in this 5 month long yellow rising wedge. Bulls have to defend 513.01 support next week otherwise this four point support line is broken. That would mean that SPY must gap up and hold that gap up all week long. This likely is finally our top here… 

Bears need to send this back under weekly 8ema support near 502 and ideally close under 497.67 demand. This would open an opportunity to move back to the weekly 20ema support near 483.

Bulls must defend weekly 8ema support at 502 and look to close back over previous supply/ POC of 512.93. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 501.31 -> 512.93  
 Demand- 497.67

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ekktou9h4koc1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbffcb954dc547b7f8f3d223208a47686f08e9c2

Now on ES here we have a bit of a different setup which is mostly related to the contract roll. So here on ES we are over previous supply of 5142. However, POC resistance sits at 5195. We touched and once again rejected the yellow rising wedge resistance this week too. 

With weekly sellers continuing to weaken here bears once again have a major opportunity here. 

Bears will need to send this below 5142 and target the weekly 8ema support near 5057. From there the target is a closure under previous demand/ support of 5014 which moves us back to the weekly 20ema support of 4890 area. 

Bulls must defend support here and push us back over POC at 5195 to then target a move up to 5200-5250.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5142  
 Demand- 5014

**QQQ WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lb9yubnh4koc1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=72325b31d5bda1c4cabb8285ba83ad328b11fd7c

I have been saying for the last two weeks that QQQ/ NQ have been far weaker than ES/ SPY. It has been very evident that ES/ SPY is all that is holding this market up right now. 

From a weekly stand point here on QQQ we have a major break of support. Our 5 month long weekly rising support is officially broken. We have not quite closed under weekly 8ema support yet but as of now that will be the bears target next week. 

With the weakest level of buying in over 4 months we are looking at a big opportunity for bears here. QQQ is about to lose extreme weekly bull momentum here too. 

Bears will look to close under minimally weekly 8ema support at 431.57 but ideally will look to close under double demand support at 423.1-428.26. This brings in a bigger downside target of the weekly 20ema support of 414.1.

Bulls must defend this weekly 8ema support here to close back over the weekly POC of 440 and target the weekly supply of 445.94.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.94  
 Demand- 423.1 -> 428.26

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0krape4i4koc1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae74a0d4fba4ae056322221b171228489f9a4ad6

Taking a look at NQ here despite the contract roll we actually have a really nice weekly triple top at 18324. This supply is clearly our line in the sand and it is also where our weekly POC sits. 

On NQ this is now the weakest buyers have been since the week after this rally started and we are also threatening to lose extreme weekly momentum. 

Bears will look to break this down under weekly 8ema support near 17838 and under the double demand support area of 17460-17718.

Bulls need to hard bounce weekly 8ema support and finally close over the triple top at 18324.

NQ FUTURES WEEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17324  
 Demand- 17460 -17718

**US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9phd3pki4koc1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffdb6888a94536207a9e497f532dd11a7ed5b71

We had a huge move up on the weekly US 10YR chart. With a massive bullish engulfing candle that actually engulfs the last 5 weeks of price action. 

The 10YR closed back over 4.286% supply with a massive bounce off the weekly 50ema support near 4.032% to put in a new weekly demand at 4.086%.

Bulls will need to see a massive double top next week here to close back under the 4.286% area.

Bears are gonna look to push the 10yr back to its previous peak before this rally started near 4.628% which will bring a lot of pressure onto the market. 

With the pending BOJ meeting and FOMC meeting this week the 10yr and DXY is going to have a massive amount of movement. 

US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.286%  
 Demand- 4.032 -> 4.086 -> 4.628%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g3rq141j4koc1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e01ebf3a03e8271202cae10f02510fd131c8cda

The dollar also had a massive bounce this week but fell just short of putting in a new weekly demand which likely we will get next week. 

DXY is rejecting and falling just short of breaching the weekly 8, 20 and 50ema resistance. 

Bulls need to hard reject EMAS here and send this back down near the 102-102.5 area.

Bears will look to pop through EMA resistance and target a move to 104.088 supply and eventually 105.591.

DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.088 -> 105.591  
 Demand- 101.705

**CL/ OIL FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vo5dzdgj4koc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=838b77b73aedf279e1107eb72ad80b36d1d0dfe6

Oil continues to be on the rise here which is also going to continue to provide upward pressure on inflation. 

With yet again another weekly double bottom after the weekly double top oil put in a new demand at 77.83. 

This is the highest weekly close since 10/30/23 which yes was the start of this massive rally on markets. 

Oil has been in an overall major bear channel since March 2022 and that resistance line stands at 83.86 for next week. A breach of that resistance would signal a possible major reversal. 

If oil closes back under double demand support of 76.57-77.83 we could see some further downside pressure.

This week was not exactly what I wanted to have happen but that okay. I ended up losing my three of my MFFU accounts which were already in the hole. I took a small break and started working on a MFFU 30k static account instead to get back in the zone. 

I passed an extra APEX account this week so I have two back up APEX PAs and three active APEX PAs. I am not sure how it happened but I had an email from topstep telling my topstepx account I canceled was reset for free today and I had an email for a free reset too and that reset one of my old accounts. I traded both of those topstep for fun today and hit 50% off the profit goal so just need to hit the next 50% next week and I pass. 

Actual trading today I took two shorts. I generally use a 4pt trigger for a 1pt BE stop loss… I ended up hitting 4pts and it of course retraced back to my 1pt BE and then dropped as expected. Today was quad witching day so I didn’t want to take any chances really but in the end today actually traded really nicely from a technical stand point. 

Looking forward to next week trading. I might trade one of my APEX PAs and then focus on passing this 30k static and two topstep evals.

ZIM integrated shipping was once a cash cow. During the pandemic they were averaging near 4,000 to 5,000 a container and raked in billions per a year… Even giving out a colossal 25+ in dividends in 2022. This is no typo but in 2022 the company earned nearly 8 billion in cash on 12.56 billion in sales! Please, by all means check! 

We are in a what have you done for me lately society. Post pandemic people want instant gratification, instant gains. So now is the time to jump in on ZIM… Why?

The last time ZIM paid a special dividend it was near this time last year, a 6.40 dividend. At that time they made 3.44 per share. \[Full year average container was 3,240\] but for the fourth quarter when they raked in cash the average was 2,122. The 4th quarter which was just reported the average rate was a dreadful 1,100! \[So you have an idea, pre pandemic, the rates were 1,600-1,900\] Fast forward to today, with the war… rates started to spike in December, I would have gladly bet that the average rate would have been much higher than the 1,139 for Q3, and when it ended up being 1,100 for the 4th quarter, that was pathetic. Stock deserved to be down…

However, the guidance was very odd, I have read the earnings call 2x, questions were asked why the wide range..

Well no one can predict war! I have checked spot rates since January 15th and I have attached photos of the 2 main sources used to check spot rates… The rates have hovered above 2,000 almost the entire quarter!

Analysts as of Friday having ZIM lose 83 cents a share for the first quarter that ends March 31st… I would love to bet anyone anywhere that they will slam that by at least 25+ cents. I would not be surprised if they come in at a profit! Why? The new vessels are much more fuel efficient, costs are going down, on the balance sheet the debt is rising as the new vessels come into play. These newer ships will better the bottom lines! I do not know of the 2rd, 3rd of full year, as analysts tried several ways to ask during the call, but I know the first quarter will be a blow up!

We have a big bonus! About 30 million shares are short of the 95 million float, or near 33%. Just because a company is short doesn’t mean it will squeeze.. however this catalyst of war, makes it very profitable….. It was asked on the call if they would be dividends if the company does indeed profit…. And it was answered that it was early to assume but that they have not changed the dividend policy 30% of profits!

791,M&A in the pharmaceutical sector - $800M+ USD deal for phase 3 testing drug acquired by AstraZeneca. Further validation for XORTX Therapeutics as they look to enter their phase 3 trials for their lead while trading at a sub $15M valuation,"(NASDAQ: XRTX | TSXV: XRTX)  XORTX Therapeutics :

Pharma mergers and acquisitions were very active in 2023 and are continuing their momentum into 2024.

Last year, the value of the top 10 M&A deals in the biopharma industry came to $115.8 billion, outranking prior sums from 2022, 2021 and 2020, which came to $65 billion, $53 billion and $97 billion, respectively. While the majority of these were bigger organizations it's a direct metric of the increasing appetite by pharma players to stay competitive by adding IP to their portfolios.

Last week's news furthers the strategy by big pharma to shore up early stage drugs with promise: 

""AstraZeneca Acquisition Brings Drug to Fill a Rare Disease Gap Left by Takeda""

792,"BOJ Decision… 3-18-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, VIX, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

We first heard of the BOJ (bank of Japan) thinking of ending their negative interest rates back on July 27th 2023. On that day (was a wild one to watch) the markets dumped 1.3% in about two hours on this news. However, despite a few weeks of downturn once the BOJ in October finally announced they were NOT going to raise rates that sent markets currently on their 5 month long rally that we are seeing potentially end this week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wh1l54kok5pc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=54f5ff0a438e53056570ab4012e3fd9a1e3c6168

While the rate decision will come out tonight at 11pm est time it is being communicated that BOJ will both increase their rates and end yield curve control and ETF purchases. This is a major deal with markets due the reverse carry that is associated with it. 

For those of you that do not know… the carry trade is known as when investors have borrowed cheaply in yen to fund bets in higher-yielding currencies like the dollar or the Mexican peso, making money on the difference. ""All these markets are linked together in terms of global liquidity flows.

My thoughts are if in the off chance BOJ does not rate hike tonight we are gonna likely wake up to a 2%+ move up on futures… however, if BOJ does hike I would be surprised if we didn’t open down at least 1%.

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9qpwwzok5pc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0985aa5b51e70d96b9e395ab569613b5e89f5d0

The big oddity about today is the fact that on SPY we actually saw stronger daily sellers (third day in a row now) something that we haven’t seen end of October. However, despite that stronger selling we still put in a green day today and at one point were up 1%. Up until the last 10 minutes flush of the day we were set to put in a new demand today but failed to do so. 

The daily doji is set up perfectly for an abandoned baby pattern (which leads to a major gap down) which perfectly correlates with a negative reaction to the BOJ news tonight. 

Bulls need to bring buyers back in and close over 517.05 daily supply in order to be back in control.

Bears continue to have an opportunity here but will have major support to break through at our triple demand of 508.05-510.37.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05  
 Demand- 508.05-509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ssgtmfpk5pc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=11205f9c5aeee1d436b3e0c81607abd15aca8a67

Interestingly enough we have a major divergence between SPY and ES. On ES we started the day with stronger sellers like SPY but by the EOD we actually saw stronger buyers here on ES which is a major divergence. Much like SPY though we did not get a new demand today.  

Bulls took price all the way back up to previous supply/ triple top resistance of 5238. However, they were not able to close and hold over that level. Bulls need to close over that level to be back in control. 

Bears need to find a daily double top and minimally close under Fridays low of 5183 but ideally will target a move back to 5158 supply. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158 -> 5238  
 Demand- 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gbbc91tpk5pc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c5133ff8890a95f8ebc80c5a1de497da5dc06

Much like SPY here on QQQ we have stronger daily sellers but despite that we put in a new daily demand/ support at 433.76. Oddly enough QQQ is the only one to get a new demand today. We now have an established range of 433.76-455.64. We now have 10 days of sellers in a row on QQQ with 4 days of stronger this is the first time we have seen 10 days of sellers since October and the first time we have had stronger sellers 4 days in a row since December 2022. 

With todays doji and rejection off the daily 8ema resistance here there is certainly an opportunity for a rejection and drop tomorrow on this BOJ data. 

Bulls need to push up and retest and close over 433.69-445.64 double supply and see buyers return. 

Bears need to minimally close under 433.76 demand from today and then will target the bigger breakdown to the daily 50ema support area of 427.7.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 433.76

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

A bit of a difference here on NQ versus ES in that we did see sellers weaken but we did not see buyers return. We barely avoided a new demand being put in today on NQ also. 

Bulls will need to push and retake the previous supply and double top resistance at 18473 to be back in control. 

Bears will look to double top reject tomorrow and bring sellers back in. A closure under previous demand of 18053 would open up a retest of 17980 and 17857 demands/ supports. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18473  
 Demand- 17857 -> 17980 -> 18053

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/34hpo6mqk5pc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29047fd8f8e669ce7dda4fc49f53b38127795e83

To be honest the VIX is fairly tame today heading into arguably the two most important days and potentially bearish days so far in 2024 and probably in the last year. 

We interestingly did not drop low enough to get a new supply nor to even threaten a new supply. The VIX is continuing to hold daily 8/ 20/ 50ema support here too which could easily lead to a major bounce. With the support of the VIX here we are potentially looking at a major failed breakout on the daily… one of the first times in the last 5 months. This is bears best window of opportunity for weakness right now. 

As of right now we have critical support/ demand area from 12.07-13.74 and we have critical resistance/ supply at 15.54-15.85.

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/87zn4v1rk5pc1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=7116d7768b4221039b7896b736cbca6299d12cc0

I felt it necessary to include the 10YR/ DXY today strictly because we have BOJ tonight and FOMC Wednesday which both could cause a massive move in the markets. 

Right now the 10YR has been on an absolute massive 7 day 7% bounce which puts it attempting to break through the 4.315-4.353% triple supply. IF the BOJ indeed does hike I would not be surprised to see a massive spike in the 10YR tonight. Major upside targets are 4.41% and 4.475%.

If the BOJ balked again and does not actually increase rates we could see a massive sell off on the 10yr and I would target a move back to EMA support near 4.19-4.242%.

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 4.315 -> 4.337 -> 4.353 -> 4.475%  
 Demand- 4.08 -> 4.41%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY**

DXY has been in a major downtrend since February 14th and it appears to have officially found a bottom last week at the 102.792 demand area. DXY has broke its down trend line and appears to be targeting a move back to 103.775-104.147. 

DXY also likely finds a massive pump tonight if the BOJ indeed does hike. 

DXY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.147 -> 104.854  
 Demand- 102.792 -> 103.775

I started my day off with a great short that I closed a little too early. I attempted to play what I thought was the recovery at 1230 but unfortunately was on the wrong side of the move. 

From there I honestly just didn’t find anything else I liked. I traded my MFFU static 30k eval today and one of my APEX PAs. I plan to continue trading these both through the week. Not the best way to start the week but a very small red day today. 

I ended up taking a short during PH which I do not generally trade PH. Ended up just enough points to breakeven on the day and call it a wash. 

I traded the topstepx eval I told you guys about last week but traded that in a way different way. Basically trying to play the macro trend and way riskier… ended up being 4 cons short during PH and attempted to sell at exactly the 53k profit goal the spread got me $60 short… so will look to finish that tomorrow. 

I expect some big fireworks tonight with BOJ at 11 and then Wednesday with FOMC.

\- $.62

\- $.72

\- $.99

\- $1.24

Following a snappy rebound off the $0.25 mark (which was a solid move), we're now seeing some cool, calm, and collected consolidation between $0.40-$0.60. Throw in a rising MACD into the mix, and it's hinting at a pretty promising upswing that might just break through those pesky resistance lines.

796,TODAY: Outcrop Silver Unveils 2024 Santa Ana Drill Program To Start in April,"Outcrop Silver & Gold Corp. (Ticker: OCG.v or OCGSF for US investors), known as Outcrop Silver, proudly unveiled its ambitious 2024 drilling program today.

The Santa Ana Silver Project boasts substantial resources: 24M oz indicated silver equivalent & 13.5M oz inferred. Moreover, metallurgical assessments show 97% gold & 93% silver recovery rates, affirming project viability. 

The drilling, set to commence in April at the Santa Ana high-grade silver project in Colombia, aims not only to expand existing resources but also to probe new targets within the project's vast expanse of potential.

With a keen focus on maximizing resource growth, the company's drilling program is meticulously designed to leverage proven mineralization while exploring uncharted territories along the 18.5 kilometers of permitted strike.

The cornerstone of this endeavor lies in the comprehensive exploration strategy, targeting both established veins and promising new prospects. 

https://preview.redd.it/lr7npwc6j6pc1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ed2a72bfe7923db6d90f4b79281af18c015de4a

Noteworthy among these targets is the El Dorado vein, where the hunt for high-grade shoots promises to extend both laterally and vertically, presenting a prime opportunity for substantial resource expansion.

Similarly, the Aguilar-Guadual target has high historical significance and silver potential, which is awaiting validation through more exploration. 

Meanwhile, the Los Naranjos and Alaska targets stand as testaments to the project's geological richness, offering avenues for further delineation of mineral resources. Notably, grades up to 7.95 g/t gold & 2,919 g/t silver at Los Naranjos.

Venturing southwest, the Los Mangos target has consistent vein occurrences and promising surface samples, hinting at a robust mineralized system awaiting discovery. 

Together, these targets form a mosaic of opportunity, each contributing to the overarching goal of enhancing the project's scalability and economic value.

With each drill turn, Outcrop Silver will venture deeper into the realm of possibility, guided by a steadfast resolve to unearth riches.

**SEATTLE, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATOS) (“Atossa” or the “Company”), today announced that the pre-menopausal, Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) / Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 negative (HER2-), breast cancer patient who received neoadjuvant and adjuvant (Z)-endoxifen therapy under an FDA-approved ""expanded access"" program has completed five years of treatment. As of the date of this press release, the patient remains cancer-free and has reported no significant safety or tolerability issues over the course of her treatment. Atossa is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need in oncology with a focus on breast cancer...**

**""We believe this patient, and her successful treatment journey, is representative of the opportunity (Z)-endoxifen has to change the treatment paradigm for the approximately 250,000 women diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer each year in the U.S.,” said Steven Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Atossa’s President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The current standard of care is sub-optimal as it often requires ovarian suppression in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women, both of which are associated with potential short-term and long-term side effects that diminish adherence. Over five years of adjuvant treatment, her daily (Z)-endoxifen treatment has been well tolerated, and there were no vasomotor symptoms commonly associated with standard of care adjuvant pharmaceuticals. She remains cancer-free today and we are grateful to have been able to help her with a difficult treatment problem.”**

811,"Bulls Show Resilience into FOMC… 3-19-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

As long anticipated the BOJ did finally hike for the first time in almost 17 years… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d37d1fnclcpc1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=f941fa0278a0202493c7748649c5e32cf24cc35c

This markets a major move for BOJ and the markets with the reverse carry. The markets did have a fairly negative reaction to it and of course the bulls straight squeezed us from those lows. The morning breakout from a technical stand had zero reason to see the pump we saw. However after we broke out mid morning it was clear it was an options squeeze which for the most part can explain the pump without technical support. 

This is just the way this bull market seems to move… we get a potential bearish technical set up… markets prepare for it… then we get a massive options squeeze to completely negate that whole downside move. Today honestly is nearly identical the move from 3/7/24. 

We head into FOMC tomorrow now after this squeeze with a market that is not hedged or set up for a downside move. This could bring an interesting move tomorrow. Without the usual option support to squeeze us higher with the right volume or sellers and movement tomorrow we could get a very similar nasty sell off like Januarys FOMC. 

Regardless of what we do overnight. I am extremely interested to see what the feds DOT plot is going to show… that truly is all that matters. If you remember in December (when inflation was trending down) we had the Feds DOT Plot saying three rate cuts by EOY 24… however, now in the face of back to back months of inflation rising and no sign of breaking below 3% inflation I can not imagine a world where the fed remotely hints at cutting that many times. I would not be surprised to see the fed pullback on expectations to one cut at most by EOY. If they do pullback we could see a pretty bearish reaction to FOMC tomorrow… However, if the fed holds steady at 3 rate cuts we are gonna see a massive pump to the upside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki11l0dlcpc1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=2722ad57b0f1775361f2470f3ba5af20db156789

As of right now the markets are expecting the first rate cut to come in June. They are holding steady at three rate cuts into EOY 24. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/omk62mcdlcpc1.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8f0e305ec58e21a9de2b97d97f1e40233390243

Looking at the last year of FOMC meetings you can see that we have closed red 50% of the time on FOMC days (for last 10 meetings). Interestingly enough three of those 5 times came on days where the Dot Plot released (highlighted those days in blue). If history repeats the odds of a red close tomorrow are fairly high… 

If the market doesn’t turn red tomorrow and continue that way Thursday into Friday then honestly there is just nothing left to take this market lower… 

I know everyone loves to joke about me being a perma bear when I call out potential bearish catalysts (like BOJ last night) but honestly while I stand firm that this is a bull market and upside is the direction until SPY/ ES close under daily 20ema support and hold… this market from a technical and normalized price action stand point is so beyond broken. Its beginning for a real correction of 5-10% to reset the internals. And truthfully as much as people like to believe that stocks only go up… a 5-10% correction would only put SPY back at 465-490 area. That sort of technical sell off and bounce would honestly be exactly what the markets need for the next 4-5 month long push up. This slow choppy grind that we have been in since really January where basically one or two trading days does all the movement and the rest are bearish/ chop is not it. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpk3alqdlcpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa148112031a5f5195a95d5338cb000553d9e348

Initially at open we had played out the abandoned baby candle I talked about but in a major turn of events we pushed up and actually are bullishly engulfing yesterdays candle. 

Bulls put in a new daily demand at 512.78. Now the one thing here to remember is that we actually do NOT have daily buyers on SPY meaning that we continue to push up without support. 

Bulls still need to retake the critical resistance/ supply of 517.05 and close over that to break out.

Bears will attempt to reject and close back under todays demand of 512.78 tomorrow. Major support still sits at 508.05-510.37 which is a triple demand. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05  
 Demand- 5080.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37 -> 512.78

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8nt4vi4elcpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f88eb88a0c0d454ad24aaa6be901b63071e0aab5

Very similarly here on ES we did get a new daily demand at 5186, however, we did actually see daily buyers return to the market today for the 2nd day in a row. Now the issue here is the fact that we do not have stronger than the previous times we were here buyers. Meaning we have less support than the previous ATHs and when we put that supply in. 

Bulls need to close hold over that 5238 supply level to then breakout to a new ATH and target 5275-5300. While ES, QQQ and NQ has not broken out of their range resistance it is certainly bullish to breakout through this supply/ resistance on ES today. 

Bears will need a major rejection to then close back under todays demand of 5186. From there the downside target remains 5158 supply. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158 -> 5238  
 Demand- 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fvfb18helcpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a24745aa5cb12931d18ec00fe74ac03d4915a3

As I mentioned yesterday QQQ was the only one that had gotten a new daily demand which was at 433.84. We did bounce and test that level today which held and reconfirmed as support. 

We now have 11 days of selling on QQQ which from high to low has only resulted in a 3.6% drop. October 19th to November 1st we had 10 days in a row of selling and during that time period QQQ fell from high to low 6.5%. The last time we saw 11 days in a row of sellers was September 15th to October 5th where we had 15 days of sellers and we also fell 6.5% during that time period. 

Much like I have said really for the last month now Tech continues to be the laggard. As of right now while we did put in a new lower demand/ support we have still come no where near breaking out through the 443.69-445.64 double supply/ range resistance. Until I see QQQ and NQ break through these range resistance levels I struggle to believe in much upside. 

Bulls need to push up and close over the 443.69-445.64 double supply and see buyers return to the markets. 

Bears need to bring stronger sellers back in and close back under 443.84 demand to then target a bigger sell off down to the daily 50ema support of 428 area.

On NQ we also got a new demand at 18072 but much like QQQ we still have daily sellers (though they did weaken). 

NQ has been trading since 2/22/24 in the same range of 17857-18472 and can not seem to make a move outside of that range. Much like I said on QQQ while we are failing to break down we are also failing at breaking out at the same time. I remain skeptical at the strength and duration of upside until I see NQ/ QQQ leading that upside move. While this was a strong bounce off double demand this candle leaves a potential double top rejection in play. 

Bulls need to push back over the daily supply of 18473 to look for a breakout to 18500+. 

Bears still have an opportunity to be in control if they can send this back below the demands of 18053-18072. The quad demand/ support area of 17857-18072 as a whole needs to be closed below in order for bears to have the prime opportunity at a bigger retrace.

I would say in a surprising turn here we actually had a very moot move from the VIX. However, the markets seemed to use the VIX crush as a leg this morning to start this rally and then it became what appears to be a short squeeze. Really no other technical explanation to justify that reversal this morning. 

We are now coming into 13.74 demand. If we break below and CLOSE below that level it will be the first time since December 2023 that the VIX has closed a new lower low. 

With FOMC tomorrow I am going to expect a lot of movement on the VIX. I am a bit intrigued that the VIX is sitting where it is sitting right now going into FOMC but looking back at the last few FOMCs this is historically where it has been sitting most of the time. 

IF we see the FED hold steady to three rate cuts and don’t throw any sort of black swan scenarios out there (they will need to answer about banks) then I could see the VIX being crushed back to the 12.44-12.79 demand area. 

If the FED pulls back and say less rate cuts then I could see the VIX breaking out to 15.54-15.85 area.

Not a whole lot I can say about today. I played two shorts this morning off critical resistances when I saw no support or justification to breakout like we did. However, we unfortunately did breakout. I was able to time a nice long that put me back barely in the green and breakeven for the 2nd day in a row. Not a whole lot I can do with this market when its moving irrational at times. I don’t hate either of my shorts I took and I would take them again. 

I was able to officially pass my Topstepx eval last night and I was short in my MFFU Static 30k account going into BOJ and was able to hit my profit target near the LOD which passed that account. 

I am still sitting on three APEX PAs right now, two backup APEX PAs (passed), a topstepX XFA (passed eval) and now a MFFU funded account. Since MFFU requires weekly trading I likely will start trading the MFFU tomorrow and let my others sit dormant. I may trade one APEX PA and MFFU together.

821,"Sora became the focus of ChatGPT in the AI field, Apple / WiMi seized the opportunity"," 

With the rapid development of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the hottest topics in the world today. Following ChatGPT, OpenAI introduced a video generation model, Sora, which pushes AI technology to a new visual dimension.

Sora is based on the past research on the DALL E and GPT models, and the core technology is the diffusion transformer model of DiT. Sora’s release once again proves that transformer technology, as a basic technology of artificial intelligence, is equally important in multimodal large models, including video technology.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24pq6n46wfpc1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=543ced14374ea24f35819675289799631ea31bd7

The Sora model generates complex scenarios with multiple roles, specific types of movements, and precise details of the subject and background. The model can understand not only what the user asks for in the prompt, but also how these things exist in the real world. OpenAI Said they are teaching AI how to understand and simulate the physical world in motion, with the goal of training models to help people solve problems that require real-world interaction.

The birth of Sora means that the era of AIGC may have come, and tools like Sora may profoundly disrupt the future of content creation and business. With the continuous popularity of Wensheng video model Sa, the attention of the capital market is also rising. It is generally believed that the launch of Sora will bring a historic opportunity for change to the AI industry chain.

**Apple’s AI innovation**

On February 28, Apple (AAPL) held an annual shareholder meeting, at which Apple CEO Tim Cook again expressed his views on Apple’s AI plan.

“” Mr Cook said the company will “break new ground” in generative AI in 2024: ” We believe it will bring transformative opportunities for our users.」

In recent months, Cook has repeatedly expressed his vision for Apple’s AI ambitions. Apple is adding new generative AI features to iOS 18 and plans to use AI to improve the capabilities of many built-in iOS apps.

**WiMi explores AIGC market**

As the launch of Sora brings new opportunities, some listed companies with cutting-edge technology layout in the AI industry chain have a first-mover advantage. Data show that the listed enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) attaches great importance to the research and development and application of all kinds of AI technologies, and pays close attention to the emerging AI Wensheng video technology platform represented by Sora.

In fact, WiMi has established an AIGC innovative application team for a long time, and developed AIGC technology is widely applied in various business scenarios such as live broadcast operation, advertising, voice interaction, video editing, and content production. WiMi actively explores the deep integration of its own brand advantages, content advantages and cutting-edge technology, and strives to realize the innovative integration of technology and industry.

Now, the release of the video generation model Sora has brought vast opportunities and development to the AI industry chain, and has naturally become the focus of wide attention of WiMi. Now WiMi has laid out the multi-modal large model related development stage of AI video, including the fusion training and processing of multimodal signals such as vision, voice and text, which will realize the penetration of downstream application scenarios such as video, 3D, games and home.

With the rapid development of AI in the field of multi-modal video generation, looking forward to the future, WiMi will actively explore the application and business innovation of emerging AI technologies such as video generation in the industrial field, so as to bring more rich and diversified application scenarios and more mature commercial models.

**To sum up**

Globally, the historical process of AI to change human society has just begun, and it is destined to make greater breakthroughs. It is expected that many related industries with AI as the core are expected to be driven in 2024. With AI technology booming, how to maintain the core competitiveness of the business in the AIGC era has become the soul of a number of technology companies. In this process, it has become an industry consensus to embrace the era of AI technology and catch the train of AIGC.

In short, it can be predicted that in the near future, artificial intelligence will be everywhere, promoting information skills from digital, network, to fully into the intelligent era. Therefore, the future application scenarios based on AI still need to be continuously explored. AI video generation is only a small direction in the multi-modal technology path, and the ChatGPT moment in the multi-modal field has not yet arrived.

822,Homerun Swing Watchlist - High Risk High Reward,"Good morning, folks! Wishing you all a splendid week thus far. This watchlist comes to you with a daring ""moonshot"" vision. Imagine investing a little with the hopes of gaining much (could this be seen as low-risk?). These picks are available on TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, or you might want to contact your brokerage directly for acquisitions. (This is shared for informational purposes and should not be construed as financial advice).

Let's kick off with $**SPQS**. 

\- Reflecting on SportsQuest ($SPQS) takes me back to the crypto buzz of 2019 (those were the days, right?). A minor investment here could potentially lead to extraordinary returns. Its trading value sits below a penny, and with a market cap just shy of $2M, the potential for significant gains is palpable.

Moving onto $**LVCE**.

\- LVCE is making waves in the healthcare sector, having recently showcased its patient acquisition strides and financial liquidity enhancements. With a market capitalization of about $25M, it appears poised for substantial expansion. ""In the wake of its restructuring, LiveCare Inc. has witnessed a dramatic increase in patient engagement, securing a remarkable 2,500 new patients since initiating its proprietary sales campaign. ... This boost in patient numbers signifies the company’s solid pledge towards accessibility, efficacy, and superior healthcare, demonstrated by the growth in patient membership from approximately 2,600 in October 2023 to around 5,100 presently. Moreover, LiveCare Inc. has enjoyed a notable surge in its monthly recurring revenue, now forecasting over $500,000 for this month, in comparison to $313,000 in December 2023, translating to a 166% rise within three months.""

Lastly, $**CHRO** is on my radar for a potential rebound after a recent dip. Although this stock hasn’t fared as expected since its mention (I’m all for being upfront), bear in mind, this watchlist is centered on the thrill of high risk and reward. With a market cap hovering between $15-20M, a slight nudge could yield significant outcomes.

Bonus - $**KULR** (tagged as a bonus since it's viewed as less risky!)

To wrap up, I trust this selection piques your interest and encourages you to consider these opportunities for your watchlist...

828,"Dovish Powell… 3-20-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

The long awaited FOMC came today and we have a lot to unpack here from the fed and their forward expectations for the rest of 2024. The fed was dovish while also being hawkish today. This meeting was mostly hawkish because despite the back to back months of increased inflation JPOW basically said the fed is not that worried nor that concerned with the future and they most bullish/ dovishly didn’t deviate from their three expected rate cuts. This is bullish because the market was not surprised. 

Lets look at exactly what was said now… (note- info pulled from various social media sources)

· The Fed does not expect to cut rates until it has greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably to 2% target.

· Fed maintains forecast of three rate cuts in 2024

· Fed projections show 2024 policy rate view unchanged at 75 basis points of reductions. 

· The Fed maintains current pace of balance sheet drawdown. 

· Fed: In weighing future policy stance, the Fed will consider a wide range of economic data.

· Fed Projections show higher longer-term policy rate projection at 2.6% vs 2.5% in December.

· Fed projections show one fewer rate cut in 2025 than previously forecast.

· Fed held interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% in March meeting. Dot Plot signals 3 rate cuts in 2024, fewer in 2025 and 2026. Fed anticipates reaching 4.6% rate by year-end 2024. Market expected lower cost of money. No major changes from January policy statement. Median preference for 3 cuts in 2024. Fed allays fears of downward rate cut revision after high inflation data.

· Fed's Powell: Economy has made considerable progress, inflation has eased substantially. 

· Fed's Powell: Ongoing progress not assured though, the path forward is uncertain.

· Fed's Powell: Labor demand still exceeds labor supply, GDP forecasts were revised higher because of data on labor supply. 

· Fed's Powell: FOMC participants expect a rebalancing in the labor market to continue. 

· Fed's Powell: Inflation expectations remain well anchored.

· Fed's Powell: Nominal wage growth has been easing.

· Fed's Powell: Our policy rate is likely at its peak.

· Fed's Powell: We are prepared to keep rates high longer if needed.

· Fed's Powell: We're likely to cut rates at some point this year, but the outlook is uncertain and we remain attentive to risks.

· Fed's Powell: We need greater confidence inflation is moving sustainably down before we cut rates.

· Fed's Powell: Inflation data came in a little bit higher than expected.

Was this bullish? Is the fed as dovish as this FOMC pump suggests? I would say once again that this is bullish in the sense that the market didn’t get any data it didn’t expect. Remember the markets like things to stay as expected. When we get surprises is when we get major negative reactions. Today the fed essentially made no changes to their forecast and stayed on the same path that it had previously laid out. That is bullish. 

However, as we dig deeper into what was said today there are certainly a few things that long term are not very bullish. The one thing that really kind of surprised me that JPOW said is that they weren’t going to let two months of bad inflation data worry them, yet he followed that up with saying that the fed also didn’t have enough confidence to even consider cutting before with the 7 months of “good” inflation data. It seems a bit contradictory in my opinion. While JPOW tried to make it clear that they were not “dismissing” the data from that last two CPI readings (hot) he surely seemed to be saying the fed wasn’t putting much weight into it yet.

The other thing that I noticed was going forward in in 2025 and 2026 they cut down the expected rates and when JPOW was asked to give guidance for June and if they thing they may have enough data to be confident to cut he refused to answer. Now I understand that he doesn’t really answer questions like that but he really beat around the bush there. The market received the lack of change as bullish today… the true test will come overnight when markets have time to properly digest everything.

Post-FOMC days have opened green 60% of the time and has opened green 4 out of 5 times that FOMC day closed green. Very solid odds we see a green opening tomorrow. 

DOT Plot FOMC meetings have opened green the next day 2 out of 5 previous times though. Trend wise and sentiment wise we are very similar to the December 13th 2023 meeting which means we might see a nice gap up overnight and continuation of this trend. 

With markets surviving both the BOJ meeting and the FOMC meeting with the bulls winning and holding us green there truly is nothing left until at least next months CPI reading but realistically until Junes Fed Meeting to take this market lower. Market has survived pretty well unscathed everything the bears could throw at it. 

If next month we get a lower CPI reading which then confirms that these past two months truly were “one offs” we are very likely to see the next major leg up in this market.

We just barely saw new buyers come in here on SPY. 

With this new ATHs and breakout over 517.05 supply the historical move has been a backtest and bounce off that previous support. Tomorrow we will look for that move if the bulls allow a retrace. 

Bulls will look to target a third day of continuation with the ultimate target being that yellow trend line which gives bulls a target of the 524-525 area. 

Bears need to minimally backtest the 517.05 supply but ideally close back under it to even remotely be considered to be back in control. But again buy the dip.

 Supply- 517.05

On ES we did see once again stronger daily buyers here and a breakout over that critical supply and triple top resistance of 5238. The bulls even backtested and hard bounced off that critical supply level. 

With a breakout here we are now attempting to breakout back into extreme bull momentum on ES. 

Bulls will look to continue for a 4th day in a row of being in control. The bulls target will be 5300-5320.

Bears need to find a hard double top and backtest that supply of 5238 and minimally close under that to be in control.

 Supply- 5238

The one thing that keeps me even remotely bearish is the fact that QQQ and NQ have not broken out of its supply resistance/ ranges. QQQ and tech as a whole continues to be the laggard and look weaker than ES does. We still on QQQ do not have daily buyers either (just like SPY). 

Bulls need to continue this push up tomorrow and close over 443.69-445.64 double supply to see further continuation. Otherwise we are likely going to see the top here and another retrace. 

Bears need to reject this double supply and look for a move back to the daily 8ema support near 439.5 and bring back in stronger daily sellers. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 433.84

NQ barely at the last moment today brought back in buyers. NQ also at the last final minute of push closed over that critical supply and resistance of 18473.  

Bulls need to hold over 18473 tomorrow and seek out a move back to ATHs to join the overly bullish ES. 

Bears have an opportunity to reject this daily supply and range resistance area of 18473. IF they can reject here and push lower we might see a move back to the daily 8ema support at 18274. There is certainly a daily double top in play.

&#x200B;

The 10YR initially had a very nasty sell off on the FOMC meeting but interestingly enough it got bought back up. I think market initially reacted to the fact that the fed held steady to its 3 rate cuts. However, I don’t think the markets fully believe that will continue to be the case. 

The 10YR came down and nicely bounced off the daily 8ema support today. Currently out range here on the 10YR for the last month and a half is 4.08% to 4.353%.

The dollar actually had a truly bearish reaction to the fed today and sold off nicely. The DXY is also sitting right on daily EMA support of the 8, 20 and 50ema. 

DXY came all the way up to the 104.147 supply level and almost to the penny touched it and rejected off it today. If we see DXY and 10YR continue lower we may see that next major leg up on the markets. 

DXY has also been in a major range from 102.792 to 104.147 for a month now.

The VIX here is the big story and is honestly one of the reasons I feel the most bullish long term now… markets officially for the first time in four months is seeing the higher lower daily trend line broken. Since December we have been consistently making higher lows. Todays drop is the first time we are seeing a previously set demand broken and closed below in 4 months. 

The next major support levels are 12.07 to 12.79.

No trades for me today. Pre-fomc is usually a chop fest and we just held in a tight about 15pt range on ES which didn’t leave much for me to trade. I was really tempted to go short at 2pm because I honestly didn’t think the fed would hold steady at 3 rate cuts (still stand by that the fed is wrong and there is no reason to continue to expect three rate cuts). But I didn’t wanna risk any PAs on that price action and I also didn’t feel like opening a new eval either. 

No trades for me today which honestly sometimes its nice to just watch the market and take a breather from the price action. We got two more days of trading this week and we will see what the market brings us.

840,"Bulls Struggle Intraday Post-FOMC… SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

After FOMC yesterday you could really see it in the markets after hours and all over social media that the bull euphoria was about as high as it has ever been. Despite a pretty impressive overnight move up on almost all major stocks and futures the bulls were not able to do anything with it intraday today and end up giving way to the bears. This sets up a pretty strong probability that bears are going to have a major retrace tomorrow into the weekend. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u6l1kpjdvqpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e390ac1629a3112fd657010476d5e1c11a4295

Interestingly enough JPOW is scheduled to speak tomorrow morning at 9am. I mean honestly should be a nothing burger because he literally just got done having the more important FOMC presser yesterday. However, the bulls are not nearly as euphoric today as they were yesterday during the presser. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zjdylhwdvqpc1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=56bbfe10ce0d3b13d2a26f7224974c341b63c8c8

The last two Fridays have been fairly bloody for the bulls too… 

**SPY DAILY**

Taking a look at SPY here we are once again setting up another abandoned baby candle here… for those of you that haven’t heard of this pattern (its real) but essentially it is a gap up and then the following day gaps down which leaves the candle “abandoned” to the upside. 

With JPOW set to speak today and the overall weakness we saw intraday today I would not be surprised if we saw a pretty major drop tomorrow and possibly overnight. 

The bulls did see buyers continue to come into though to support this new ATHs. 

Bulls need to defend 520.51 which is the now support from FOMC and look for a push back to ATHs into EOW. 

Bears need to see the gap down and break through 520.51 to then target 517.05 supply which will correlate with the daily 8ema support. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05  
 Demand- 512.78

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Now taking a look at futures here we are getting a much more convincing top here with this doji candle. We also got a new ATH here on ES with stronger buyers to support upside. 

The one thing that I don’t like for the bears here is that this doji actually closed green and left a good sized candle body. A lot of times like this these candle actually lead to a double bottom and bulls will push higher the next day on a failed breakdown. 

Bulls need to double bottom and close at ATHs tomorrow to have strength into Monday. 

Bears need to break through support of 5296 and target a bigger sell off back to 5238 supply which was previous resistance and is now support. 

ES FUTURE DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5238  
 Demand- 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yp48wfyevqpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea0ca8e9d3cb4ba0599726595e1b4eaf2b18ec9

We have a similar potential abandoned baby pattern here on QQQ too. Yesterday I mentioned that the bulls had still not broken through the double supply of 443.69-445.64. Today though they decided to completely gap up over those levels. The bears were able to sell it back down to backtest that previous supply and now support at 445.64. Bulls holding this support is fairly bullish, however, they have still not seen daily buyers return to QQQ. 

The one truly incredible phenomenon I am seeing here on QQQ is the fact that we actually are seeing stronger sellers today despite the fact that we closed a new ATH and reached a new ATH. That is not something that generally happens… meaning this upside is 100% unsupported which gives way for a potential major sell off tomorrow. 

Bulls need to defend 445.64, see daily buyers come back in and push back towards ATHS into EOW. 

Bears need to close back under 445.64 but ideally back under 443.69 with stronger sellers to have an opportunity to backtest the 443.84 demand area. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 443.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

We have almost an identical setup on NQ here as we do on ES. We had a breakout, we have stronger buyers, however we are closing out a doji on the daily candle here. 

Again while dojis are generally seen as bearish reversal candles… when we have these bigger bodies they actually often times lead to failed breakdowns and will result in a push back up the next day. 

Bulls need to defend 18543 support from yesterday and push back to a new ATHS to be bullish into Monday. 

Bears will need to break under 18543 to then target a bigger move back to 18473 supply which was previously resistance and now is support to watch. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18473  
 Demand- 18072 

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6rbkq2nfvqpc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e21c82134cd7f93a248b571ec41c9899c78ded

We once again saw a lot of movement on the VIX today. We as I mentioned yesterday broke through out 4 month long support line yesterday. We ended up finding major support off the 12.44-12.79 area as I mentioned I expected us to. 

With the VIX closing out a nice doji candle that sets up a perfect morning doji star reversal pattern higher… and ES/ NQ setting up bearish reversals with their dojis I am generally looking for a fairly red day tomorrow. It has been a while since VIX and SPY/ QQQ correlated perfectly but with inverse patterns closed on the daily… the downside is a very high probability for tomorrow. 

Bulls need to sell the VIX under 12.44 which has been the ultimate bottom for the last 4 months now. 

Bears want to see the VIX breakout back over 13.74 to be back in control.

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

Quick look at the 10YR yield here we saw a major bounce here off the daily 20ema support of 4.23%.

We did not quite get a new demand/ support on the 10YR yet but with this bounce this sets up a move back to 4.342-4.353% double supply area and plays into the odds of markets showing weakness overnight and into tomorrow. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.342 -> 4.353%

The dollar had the biggest bounce of the day with a massive bullishly engulfing candle which engulfs the last four days of price action. 

With a new demand and support at 103.373 we are looking at a move on DXY back to 104.147 which again should bring some weakness overnight on markets. If DXY can close over 104.147 and head towards 104.854 that will bring even more potential for downside. Bulls need to defend resistance at 104.147.

Not a ton of playable action for me today the whole morning was essentially a very tight range on the markets which made it for me at least hard to find a play. I was happy to take a 5 pt short early this morning and after that I truly just couldn’t find anything that looked good to play. 

I wouldn’t have trusted the short originally even though it ended up playing out in a major way because it was against the trend of the day. 

All in all no complaints here green day is a good day. I got my 5pts which is my goal for the day.

✍️Reply with more good ones please

Currently the Biden administration and (HSS) The United States Department of Health and Human Services is pushing for reclassification of marijuana from a (high risk) Schedule 1 drug to a (Low risk) Schedule 3 substance.

This would result into so much benefits making it so much easier for these companies to operate and increase profitability. Taxes would be dramatically reduced for MJ companies. Sched 1, 2 drugs are prohibited from taking deductions on even ordinary business expenses. If MJ gets reclassified to a schedule 3 then most of these marijuana stocks will be a lot more profitable and healthier position going forward. For the companies which touch the plant, they will finally be able to write off ordinary business expenses. The 280E put a lot of MJ companies out of business and/or made it extremely difficult to turn a profit. The Section 280E of the IRS tax code prohibits marijuana businesses from taking traditional business deductions because the plant is listed as a Schedule 1 drug under the federal Controlled Substances Act.

Another big catalyst to watch out for is the Safer Banking Act.

The SAFER Banking Act passed by a notable bipartisan majority of 14–9 on September 27, 2023. The bill (S. 2860) was placed on the Senate legislative calendar under general orders the following day. A Senate floor vote is now pending. 

This would open doors for institutional investors as well.

The Act provides “safe harbor” protections to financial institutions, lenders, insurers, and others serving the industry, ensuring they are not penalized for offering services to cannabis businesses, which will likely increase the accessibility of banking, lending, and insurance services for the marijuana industry.",1711061250,823020,StockPicksNYC,t2_2kck9c07,1773ed140d20b240ae7e76c521c73085168773de25b398ad3f9d1913b1abeeaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1bkjya3/cannabis_stocks_really_worth_looking_into_right/

846,CHRO's Innovative Eye Pain Treatment Program,"Morning, team! Just popping in with a quick update on CHRO – yes, the one I’ve been eyeing during its ups and downs! Communicated disclaimer: this isn’t investment advice, and I’m no expert in the field of science, but I’m here to share some info that’s recently caught my attention. Don’t forget to share your thoughts below!

**Here’s What’s New**  
So, CHRO has just rolled out their eye pain treatment program, taking a bold step into an area that’s both widely experienced and notably underserved. Here’s the scoop:

**Launch Highlights**  
CHRO is making a splash by entering an estimated $2.5 billion market with its new eye pain treatment program. They’ve enlisted the expertise of Dr. Simon Chandler, a veteran in the field of ophthalmic drug development, signaling a deep dive into serious research and development.

**The Science Explained**  
At the forefront of Chromocell’s strategy is their emphasis on targeting the sodium channel NaV1.7, identified as a crucial element in eye pain relief. Their approach focuses on NaV1.7 channels located on the cornea, aiming to tackle everything from sudden corneal abrasions to persistent conditions like dry eye and neuropathic pain. Considering the staggering number of corneal abrasions reported annually in the U.S. alone (about 5 million), this initiative could significantly alter the landscape for sufferers.

**Why This Matters**

* **Bridging a Treatment Gap:** There’s a noticeable void in effective eye pain solutions. Chromocell’s approach not only offers a fresh alternative but also represents a beacon of hope for those enduring various forms of eye discomfort.
* **Market Impact:** Venturing into a $2.5 billion market, CHRO is not just expanding its portfolio but is also setting the stage for substantial industry influence and potential financial gains.
* **Expertise in Play:** The recruitment of Dr. Chandler emphasizes the company’s dedication to leading-edge solutions and quality. His rich background in ophthalmic drug development lends significant weight to the project’s success odds.

856,"TODAY: EV Minerals (EVM.v) Shines Light on Promising Historical North Zone Results, Unveiling Compelling Drill Targets at EV Nickel Project in Quebec.","EV Minerals Corporation (CSE: EVM and FSE: RLC) is trading in the green after announcing exciting developments at the EV Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project today.  

https://preview.redd.it/ksm1adc5wxpc1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb2f523d44b49509cab519a4be4cc238d85db78

The project, located in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region, Quebec and spanning 1,792 hectares, boasts an undeveloped NI 43-101 non-compliant resource estimated at 5.585 million tonnes, featuring grades of 0.21% Ni, 0.11% Cu, and 0.03% Co, the project holds substantial promise for nickel, copper, and cobalt mineralization.

Originally discovered in 1987 as the McNickel deposit, the EV Nickel Project has undergone extensive exploration efforts, including a comprehensive drilling campaign in 1989. 

The mineral claims hosting the deposit harbor a magmatic sulphide deposit characterized by disseminated, stringer, and massive nickel, copper, and cobalt mineralization, embedded within a gabbro - leucogabbro host rock formation.

Today, EV Minerals unveiled compelling drill targets in the project's North Zone, indicative of resource expansion opportunities through infill drilling. These targets stem from the company's comprehensive desktop compilation, which highlighted notable intersections and mineralization patterns.

Initial exploration efforts, including a 13-hole drill program completed in 2023, yielded promising results, with assays indicating significant sulphide mineralization.

Notable intersections include hole 89-MCN-132, which showcased wide zones exhibiting elevated cobalt, copper, and nickel grades, with 0.03% Cobalt (Co), 0.11% Copper (Cu), and 0.38% Nickel (Ni) over 14m, and 0.09% Co, 0.49% Cu, and 1.17% Ni over 2.4m. 

Furthermore, hole 89-MCN-133 revealed high-grade pockets of Nickel, grading 0.10% Co, 0.11% Cu, and 1.64% Ni over 2.30 m, and 0.08% Co, 0.06% Cu, and 1.47% Ni over 0.7m. Copper was also intersected in hole 89-MCN-134, grading 0.02% Co, 1.17% Cu, and 0.16% Ni over 0.50m. 

These concrete figures underscore the project's mineral potential and pave the way for further exploration and development initiatives. With the digitization of historic exploration data providing invaluable insights, EV Minerals is well-positioned to capitalize on these findings

857,"Looking Forward to the JPM Collar Roll… 3-22-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

In my TA last night I was worried that the structure of the daily candles on ES and NQ wouldn’t provide the proper structure for downside and that is exactly what we saw today. 

Actually what I find to be even more impressive today is the fact that basically for the last 2 weeks we have seen NQ/ QQQ be the laggard which has held markets down and prevent ES/ SPY from pushing up most days. Today we saw a major shift where NQ/ QQQ were actually the strength that held this market from seeing a more major sell off today. This is going to be interesting to watch play out next week as if we are finally seeing strength return to tech and spy can hold its strength then we are looking at the next major breakout in this market. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ywfu04n0ypc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0e599fa50c2be6e3553feb115d774687001880e

Looking at the calendar for next week there isn’t much to worry about until Thursday when we get GDP and we also get UofM Consumer sentiment at 10am. The reason we get Consumer sentiment on Thursday is because Friday is a holiday and the market is closed. So that is an usual day with a lot of data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yv8cjtjn0ypc1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c75d36817e149d5c6576592e536783bd38754f15

Friday stock market is closed for good Friday. The other big thing to keep in mind for Thursday which is going to make it an even more miserable to trade is that Thursday is also quarterly options expiration. This is the day the famous JPM collar rolls. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jj8tuu3o0ypc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b194690f914112351779e20eda26f0376e25b539

For a friendly reminder here JPM is:  
 Short- 5015 Calls  
 Long – 4510 Puts  
 Short- 3800 Puts

Now my math might be off a smidge here but as far as I can tell here currently as of mid day today JPM is down about $621 million on this position. While that seems extreme when you consider the fact that this collar is a “protective collar” and you consider the fact that all of their assets and other things are sitting basically at ATHs… its probably not that big of a deal at all. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/79vrj4ho0ypc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de2a3ebb08e492358ecf65e15f06abeb9b1c8dec

From a weekly stand point this is a major bullish move in the markets. After essentially the last three weeks being major consolidation we are seeing a huge move up here on SPY. 

With the new supply being put in at 512.93 and seeing multiple weeks in a row with no buyers to support upside we are finally seeing weekly buyers come back in to support upside and we finally got a new demand. The last few times we have gotten a new demand we have seen a push of 1.5%, 5.5%, and then 1% before a new supply is put in. That means on average we should be looking for about a 2.7% move up before we find our next top which gives us a move to about 536.1. However, as you can see the trend is small breakout then big breakout… this is our time for a bigger breakout which could be about 5%. That gives us an upside move to about 548.1. That gives us an upside target of basically 540 before we find resistance again. 

When we look at the trend lines here we are seeing 527.05 for the red bull channel resistnace and 531.6 for the current yellow bull channel resistance for next week. 

Bulls will target the breakout to 527-530 next week. 

Bears could look for a double top here on the weekly and backtest 509.48-512.93 levels. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 512.93  
 Demand- 509.48

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lg8lnwo0ypc1.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5cb3c57f5c04d41da03c6925df9f8700b707f49

Looking at futures here we have a similar move in that we also got a new demand here at 5183. Now due to the contract roll our structure is a bit different so our demand is actually over previous supply of 5142.

Much like SPY we did see stronger weekly buyer come back in today which is certainly bullish and we have a sizeable breakout from our consolidaiton range. 

Bulls will continue to target upside with their ultiamte target being a move up over 5400.

Bears need to find a double top here, breakdown buyers again and target a closure back under 5183 demand. 

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5142  
 Demand- 5183

**QQQ WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kzexiudp0ypc1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ebca2dcec5338a53e795349d63351aa7990e880

Now this is where despite seeing strength in tech today I am still not fully convinced that we are that bullish next week on QQQ/ NQ. Looking at QQQ here despite the large bounce off daily 8ema support which is putting in a new demand at 433.61 we did not see buyers return to the market. 

We did however, close over the weekly supply and resistance level of 445.94 which gives us a major breakout over the last basically 4 weeks of consolidation. 

Bulls will target a breakout to the red bull channel resistance at 458.2 and the yellow bull channel resistance at 464.11. 

Bears have an opportunity to drop us lower here back to previous triple demand support area of 423.1-433.61. The weekly 8ema support near 435.2 is a major bounce area. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.94  
 Demand- 423.1 -> 428.26 -> 433.61

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5u6s7psp0ypc1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=885435027a27495d55d810be5b3ac6d42ab42520

Now that NQ had its contract roll up we also are seeing slightly different structure here but it did provide a new weekly demand at 18054. This actually forms a a new triple bottom on NQ too. 

With a breakout and closure over 18324 we are seeing a breakout of our 4 week long consolidaiton range. Realistically for the last 7 weeks NQ has consoldiated in about a 600 point range and we finally broke out to the upside of that range and brought in stronger weekly buyers. 

Bulls have an opportunity to breakout to the red bull channel resistance of 18957 and the yellow channel resistnace of 19085. 

Bears have an opportunity to with the wick on this weekly candle to seek out a double top and drop us back under previous supply/ support of 18324. Minimally I do expect that level to be backtested this week. 

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18324  
 Demand- 17460 -> 17718 -> 18054

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mgkqk98q0ypc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc6aa6889280187ef5579838ea997cdacfd97c76

The VIX did defend the 12.44-12.79 triple demand area again today. It took until the final minutes of the day but they finally pushed the VIX up just enough to get a new demand. Right now we are seeing a double bottom off 12.91 with stronger reversal candles for the upside push Monday on the VIX.  

We are once again left with a doji closure here on the VIX and holding of critical support. I am looking for an early week bounce on the VIX. Which likely brings weakness to the markets on Monday. 

**US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mfbca1pq0ypc1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd39de03737df3d0ee267134199cfa2e5a5e323

Taking a look at the 10YR and DXY we are actually seeing once again major divergence between them. Here on the 10YR we had a large failed breakout and now we are putting in a new supply at 4.305%. 

The 10YR remains in an uptrend now for the last 3 months with critical support sitting at 4.161% for next week for the yellow bull channel. 

Bulls will look to see the 10YR drop back down to 4.032-4.086% double demand area next week. 

Bears want to find a short bounce/ double bottom and push back over and close over critical 4.305% supply next week. 

US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.305%  
 Demand- 4.032 -> 4.086%

**DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w53f6d4r0ypc1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db257d46633a06ddbbf1e7d0952394decfdf075

Now contrary to the 10YR we actually had a major breakout here on the dollar. The dollar not only broke out over previous supply and resistance of 104.088 but it also broke through the red bear channel resistance. This resistance dates all the way back to October when we saw this 5 month long rally on ES/ NQ start. 

If we are seeing DXY breakout of this downtrend officially perhaps we are seeing the start of the next wave down on markets. 

Bulls need to find a double top with a push back down to 102.74 demand. 

Bears are going to seek a move to the suppyl of 105.591 which dates back to september. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.088 -> 105.591  
 Demand- 102.74

**CL/ OIL FUTURES WEEKLY** 

&#x200B;

Oil continues to be in its slow grind up making similar double bottoms and double tops week after week. Essentially for the last 1.5 months we have put in a new supply then new demand every week. 

This week we are finding supply/ resistance at 81.02. We are seeing a stronger doji weekly candle here which just might signal a more permenant top. 

Bulls still have weekly buyers here which could lead to a more major breakout to the mid 80s. 

Bears need to use this double top to bring weekly sellers back in and close under previous double demand/ support of 76.57-77.83.

CL/ US OIL FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 81.02  
 Demand- 76.57 -> 77.83

What an absolutely mind numbingly boring day and week of trading. 

Overnight I had expected that we might get the failed breakdown today which for the most part did play out. Seeing such strong divergence on ES and NQ made it even more difficult to play today for me as my system generally relies on both being in agreement. 

I took an early morning short that I ended up setting a tighter stop loss than usual because I had saw NQ go for a major pop at the time I went short and lost faith in my play. I ended up getting stopped out before it then dropped over 5 points. I was able to essentially recover my morning shorts loss on a failed breakout around mid day. However, from there we had such strong divergence and overall chop/ consolidation that I wasn’t able to find anything else to trade today. 

All in all, a small green week but a green week nonetheless. I look forward to trading next week and bring in some more green next week. I continue to just focus on my MFFU 30k static account right now and bringing that to a payout. Once I finally get a payout I will start to bring in more accounts again but right now just focused on getting one of my accounts to payout. From there I will be a bit more aggressive. This market is for me still frustrating to trade from a technical stand point so I am not willing to size up to two contracts nor risk more than one account at a time anymore.

885,Watching $JEWL for a bounce here - Price targets included,"Afternoon, everyone! This week, I've decided to add JEWL to my radar for a couple of reasons. First up, I'm sensing a potential 10ish% uptick on the horizon, aiming for a first target around $0.35. Secondly, the lab-grown diamond market seems like a promising arena for long-term investment.

Communicated disclaimer: this isn’t financial advice.

I'll dive into some detailed analysis (DD) tomorrow, but for now, let's chat about some technical aspects. I'm eyeing Adamas One Corp. (JEWL) to possibly hit close to $0.35 shortly, drawing on a blend of technical analysis and market vibes.

Here’s the essence of my thought process:

1. **Price Action and Volume:** Currently at $0.33, JEWL has been dancing between $0.32 and $0.34. This snug range hints at a brewing momentum, waiting for the right push. The volume's on the quieter side, but a spike might just be the spark we need for a price shift.
2. **Market Sentiment and Sector Moves:** JEWL sits in the luxury goods scene, a place known for its roller-coaster rides, heavily influenced by how deep people are willing to dig into their pockets and the economic climate. Recent buzz around the company’s achievements and offerings could warm investors up.
3. **Technical Indicators:**

* **Moving Averages:** Hovering around key moving averages might signal a tide change. Being above a short-term average could mean we’re looking at a bullish phase.
* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** An RSI lurking near 30 suggests the stock might be too cold, hinting at a bounce back, while an RSI close to 70 could mean it’s overheating, possibly leading to a cooldown.
* **Support and Resistance Levels:** Our current playfield of $0.32 to $0.34 outlines the battle lines. Breaking past these could signal a leap in the making.

**Market Dynamics:** The big picture and the sentiment towards smaller caps also play their part. A sunny outlook in the stock market could give JEWL and its peers in the luxury domain a nice lift, especially with growing intrigue in lab-grown diamonds.

**Historical Performance:** Though history isn’t a crystal ball, it can offer clues. JEWL has been quite the roller coaster, meaning even slight shifts in market mood or investor sentiment can trigger significant price moves.

[Price targets are on the chart](https://preview.redd.it/z2iic4o2jjqc1.png?width=3161&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a0058621106ba66b2e48660fc3a562210311159)

In wrapping up, definitely keep your eyes peeled on this one, folks! It’s in that sweet spot of being oversold, but remember, that’s where the opportunities lie!

886,"Bulls Defend Daily 8ema… 3-25-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Today felt a lot like Friday in that we had a nice move down and the bears once again couldn’t do anything with it. Actually today felt extremely similar in the fact that ES once again was the laggard while NQ continued to rally and hold the market up. Today was a bit interesting seeing the strength from NQ because there really wasn’t much of big tech green to justify that and on a daily timeframe we didn’t have buyers to support the upside. I definitely was caught off guard a little bit by the upside recovery from open into power hour. 

ES found itself in a much weaker consolidation compared to NQ today. I was a bit surprised by the fact that opening candle NQ went on a pretty impressive sell off only to recover and push green the rest of the day. Also surprisingly and much like Friday SPY found itself in a $1.3 range which is about 31% of its day average move which is a very small intraday move. From 10am until Power Hour we saw ES close inside the same 6 pt range all day. For a good portion of the day we saw ES holding as tight as a 2-3 point range. 

Remember this is a shortened 4 day week and we have quarterly options expiration Thursday. There is no real major data or economic news tomorrow to worry about. Based on the last two days of movement honestly it is a bit hard to see a bear case. Bulls have done a very good job of holding support without really having support to back that up. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mlpfdasnljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ce910c030a06eae4b17ee2fac872fb046ebea54

On Friday we put in a new supply at 523.45 and saw stronger sellers come in. We do still have daily sellers here on ES which did strength today with the EOD drop.  After three days of dropping we appear to be forming a nice bull flag with a potential breakout off the daily 8ema support. Despite the upside bounce we did not find a new demand today so there is still some daily downside to be expected. 

Bulls are going to target a move back to 423.45 and if they can close over that level will likely find themselves in a bigger breakout to the 528-530 area into EOW. 

Bears need to find some intraday strength and close under daily 8ema support of 518.26 and preferably previous supply of 517.05 to be in control. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05 -> 523.45  
 Demand- 512.78

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ba7gwm7oljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb686e6d2411a378d7a091bbad29d25ff38eb341

On Friday Es put in a daily double top off 5309 which resulted in a new daily supply. We did see back to back days of daily buyers weakening significantly on ES but we do not have daily sellers. Much like NQ we have a very large bounce off the daily 8ema support and a potential reversal doji candle to push higher. 

Bulls need to close over 5309 to then target a bigger breakout to 5350-5400. 

Bears are not in control until they can close under daily 8ema support of 5260 and supply of 5238.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5238 -> 5309  
 Demand- 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/478c9eloljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a8a1ecbedd7bc18b59934ad4d15dd145c2b5ab7

The major difference here on ES/SPY and QQQ/ NQ is that on Friday we did not see new daily supplies put in on QQQ/ NQ which shows the continued upside strength on tech relative to spy. We came back down and had a really nice bounce off previous double supply/ resistance of 443.69-445.64 which is now acting like support. However, at the very last minutes of the day we dropped low enough to put in a new supply at 446.44.

We do continue to see daily sellers but they have weakened for two days in a row now. With the daily 8ema support holding it is hard to believe in further downside as bulls have defend both previous resistance and EMA support well. However, with a new daily supply and sellers favor does go to the downside. 

Bulls need to close back over previous resistance of 448.9 from 3/21.

Bears need to close under daily 8ema support and previous resistance of 443.63 which is now support. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.69 -> 445.64  
 Demand- 433.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qv8flb0pljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f6035b53f2ead2f05fc3055dbd2c1f2ee96fa84

Now looking at NQ here we have a very similar move here as ES in that we got a large bounce off the daily 8ema support of 18435. We also did not get a new supply last week and much like QQQ continued to bounce off previous supply/ resistance of 18473 which is now support. However, like QQQ with the EOD drop we were able to get a new supply at 18584. Its not quite the perfect triple top but there is three days of rejections off this supply level.

Bulls need to continue to defend support here and breakout over 18600 which is three day long resistance now. 

Bears minimally need to close under 18434 daily 8ema support. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY  
 Supply- 18473  
 Demand- 18072

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1uq9efpljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=386cb93d662c1f55339f748309beeb2e63d20c22

The VIX had a very interesting move today in that we finally got that sizeable upside pump I was looking for but almost instantly they sold that pump off. It is definitely tough here because much like ES intraday it just couldn’t move down but that seems almost perfectly correlated with the fact that the VIX refused to hold green all day. We also had a very weird spike up on the VIX of about 1.2% at 110pm today that was correlating perfectly with a drop playing out. However, the spike was instantly sold off on the VIX which led to a breakout on ES. 

No new supply here on the VIX today either. Honestly there just isn’t a lot of direction in the last 2-3 days of movement on ES, and VIX. It remains hard to be against the upside as obviously this is a bull market but the technicals (especially intraday) certainly don’t support upside either. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/apjm2hspljqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6699439ace739dc528cbde3e90dcbc1494a1316d

Today was just one of those days that looking back was a day better spent sitting cash. What really is “funny” looking back is that if I had just held my original short pretty much all day long I would have in the end finally saw 5pts of profit… which is wild considering that would be holding the same play for basically 6 hours without a 5pt stop loss hitting or 5pt profit hitting. 

For me I never really saw an upside case all day long. There just (Especially on ES) was never the proper support on the daily timeframe nor on the 5 and 15min timeframe to justify upside. Which is why you see I shorted so many times today. Price action just got pinned all in the same spot for so long today and honestly I am very surprised that we broke out instead of down based on the support we saw. All of the small profits you see was me seeing the bigger breakdown set up but setting a profitable stop just over my BE as I didn’t want to catch a failed breakdown. In the end had I been patience we would have seen the drop. 

Even looking at NQ none of the internals today really justified the recovery it had opening candle either. However, NQ just continued to push higher and higher today which is likely what prevented ES from selling off. This is the second day in a row of that happening now too. 

We ended up getting the sell off I was looking for during power hour but by that time it was just too late and the damage was done. My last short of the day I accidentally doubled click the short so I set a tighter stop loss as I didn’t want to take too big of a loss and of course I got ticked out nearly to the tick before it finally sold off EOD. 

Is what it is. On to tomorrow. 

I showed my tradeovate results today as im not sure what was going on with ninja today I had one point where it froze on me and for whatever reason my PnL is showing incorrectly too. Was showing a way bigger loss than tradeovate and what I hand calculated based on my entries and exits.

898,Deep Dive into JEWL + 33% PreMarket Move,"Good morning, everyone! Let's brighten up this day with some sparkling DD (lol). I promised to dive deeper into its core aspects today, so here we are. Communicated disclaimer, this isn't financial advice.

By the way -  JEWL has soared approximately 33% since we last talked. 

**Introduction**  
Picture this: a realm where diamonds, those timeless beacons of strength and beauty, are not only unearthed from the depths (often through processes marred by ethical concerns and environmental harm) but also born from cutting-edge technology. This is the reality envisioned by Adamas One Corp. (JEWL), a trailblazer in the lab-grown diamond industry, pushing us to reconsider how we perceive these treasured stones.

**Overview**  
Adamas One Corp. shines in the dynamic world of lab-grown diamonds with their innovative Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technology. With about 18.5 million shares in the public domain, JEWL emerges as a hidden gem

**Financials**  
As the lab-grown diamond market is projected to balloon to $55 billion with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, Adamas One is strategically placed to carve out a significant slice of the market pie. While we won't get lost in the financial weeds today, it's clear the investment landscape is twinkling with opportunities, featuring an array of entry points from the modest $0.3600 to the aspirational $1.97+, paving diverse pathways for investor engagement.

**Interesting Info**  
Did you realize that JEWL is the only publicly traded entity in this niche field? Since its establishment in 2019, the company has leveraged decades of expertise and amassed over 36 patents worldwide, not just competing but setting the pace. Their base in Greenville, South Carolina, is a testament to American innovation, crafting diamonds that are as kind to the planet as they are captivating to the eye.

**Reasons to Consider Adamas One Corp.**

* **Cutting-edge Innovation:** Adamas One is a lighthouse of innovation, holding critical patents in the realm of CVD technology for lab-grown diamonds.
* **Market Expansion:** The lab-grown diamond market's rapid growth signals that JEWL is in a prime position to benefit from changing consumer trends favoring sustainability and ethical sourcing.
* **Operational Mastery:** Their dedication to a vertically integrated model spells unparalleled efficiency, rigorous quality assurance, and cost savings.
* **Eco-Friendly Choice:** The company stands out for its minimal environmental impact and ethical manufacturing, striking a chord with the eco-conscious consumer.
* **Visionary Leadership:** Guided by John “Jay” Grdina and a seasoned team, the company is navigating towards a bright future in the lab-grown diamond sector.

In wrapping up, I believe this presents a fascinating opportunity to get involved with (or at least keep an eye on) a company poised to shine brighter than many others in the coming years.

902,CURLF GTBIF MSOS How long will it take for the DEA to reschedule Cannabis? *MUST READ* DD,"In the case of marijuana rescheduling, several months have already passed since the DEA received HHS’s recommendation to move marijuana to Schedule III. There is no way to know exactly how long the process will take for the DEA to determine if it will initiate rulemaking. It could happen in days, weeks, months, or even years. HOWEVER, the politics involved in rescheduling indicate that a decision will likely be made in the next few months, not years.

Great recent article going over previous examples of drug rescheduling (3-22-24) Packed with research *MUST READ*
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-is-the-timeline-for-rescheduling-3301256/

Example of when Hydrocodone Combination Products (HCPs) were moved from Schedule III to Schedule II during 2014 in about 6 months after HHS sent the recommendation to the DEA shown in the article

Another example, in September 1998 FDA recommended to DEA that Marinol be rescheduled to Schedule III, and in July 1999 DEA rescheduled Marinol to Schedule III.

So the answer is within months but possibly sooner, especially with Biden Administration, HHS, FDA involved.

HOW LIKELY IS FOR DEA TO RESCHEDULE CANNABIS: 90%

According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is likely to follow the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). 

According to the Report, the DEA “CONFIRMED” in a 2020 congressional hearing that IT WILL BE BOUND by the FDA’s RECOMMENDATION, “and if past is prologue, it could be likely that DEA will reschedule marijuana according to HHS’s RECOMMENDATION.”

905,"Low Volume and Low Range Woes… 3-26-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Note- I am going to be out of town on Thursday. I will not have a weekly TA up and I will not be around to trade. I recommend most of you not trade Quarterly Options Expiration as it can be miserable. 

The last 3-4 days of trading has probably been some of the worst trading and movement I have ever seen. The more I think about (these are the things that keep me up at night) the more I realize that honestly this market has no where to go right now. Now again everyone loves to call me a permabear but realistically the “dovish” FOMC on Wednesday was absolutely the worst case scenario for this market and here is why. 

Pretty much since Decembers FOMC this market has just been riding up higher and higher on the backs of data and economic events (think NVDA earnings, CPI, FOMC, etc). Which honestly is not a huge deal and in and of itself is not a problem. In the end this is a bull market and we should expect price to go up not down (long term). However, the issue we have run into now after this 5 month (going on 6 month) long rally is that this market doesn’t have any reason to go higher… 

The reason that FOMC was the worst case scenario for this market is because all JPOW did was confirm that nothing has changed since the last two FOMC meetings. Which obviously on FOMC day as massively received in a bullish way. Why? Because the market HATES the unknown. The only times we get major sell off is when this market reacts to the unknown or unexpected. Which is why most data causes an upside move. However, the issue now is that FOMC is over and this market has no other reason to keep going up. There is not strong enough bull case with CPI/ PPI (inflation) still rising and essentially JPOW refusing to acknowledge that. There also with the 10yr and DXY elevated just isn’t a strong enough bull case there technical wise. We are seeing it here on the daily technicals where there is no proper support to keep pushing up. However, the issue is while we might not have stronger support and reason to keep pushing higher. We have not reached a time where we have reason to sell either. The issue is (which is why volume is so incredibly low since FOMC) that no one wants to buy here because they are all afraid the 5-10% correction (which is healthy) is coming. However, at the same time you can not convince enough people to sell here because they are all afraid of missing the next 20% rally. This is literally worse case scenario in this market as no one can and no one wants to make the first move. I do hope post quarterly options we get a rebalance and see some solid movement though next week.

To show just how incredibly strong the last 5-6 months has been (and even before that) we have not seen a -2% or lower close in over 274 trading days. This is the third longest streak in market history. For reference 274 trading days is about a year and a month or so…. 352 trading days would be about 1.5 years. There is about 250 trading days in a year. 

This is where most people say that even during the most bullish of bull markets (think 2020) we still usually see 5-10% pullbacks throughout that rally. It is fairly unnatural how straight up this rally has been and how we have had zero pullbacks. 

Today once again left us with a sizeable over night move… incredibly tight chop basically all day long… and then a major power hour move. This market remains difficult to trade.

Honestly some of the straight ugliest candle movement and patterns on the daily we have seen in a very long time. I was partially correct in that the inverted hammer candle would lead to a breakout but I was also correct that we didn’t have proper support for the upside and would likely see downside. This was straight up another ugly day of trading. 

We continue to see stronger daily sellers on ES which means there is not an upside play right now. We also have not threatened to see a new demand and have lower volatility. All of this points to further downside being plausible here tomorrow especially considering we have a major bearish engulfing candle. 

Bulls are still holding daily 8ema support which sits at 518.41. Bulls need to defend that support and put in a new demand. A closure over 523.45 supply puts them back in control. 

Bears need to close under 518.41 the daily 8ema support to then target the previous supply and range resistance (now support) at 517.05.

On ES we have once again saw a solid drop in buying support. However, we once again have a failed breakout which now gives us a daily inverted hammer candle here on ES. This with daily 8ema support near could be support for a run back at 5309 supply. However, with this incredibly low volume and range movement we are seeing it is hard to imagine us being very bullish going forward. 

I have been looking for a backtest of 5238 since Friday last week and I do think we will get that tomorrow or Thursday. 

Bulls need to defend daily 8ema support at 5263 and look for a push back near 5309 supply. 

Bears would like to see seller come in here and will look to close under daily 8ema support of 5263 to then target a bigger drop to 5238 supply.

Looking at QQQ we have a very similar ugly pattern here. After our daily 8ema support bounce yesterday we went up and backtested the daily supply at 446.44 and reconfirmed that as resistance. We also have stronger daily sellers that returned today on QQQ. 

With a failed breakout over this supply here and daily sellers remaining the favor without a new demand (Support) is that we will continue lower. We also here on QQQ have a daily bearish engulfing candle. 

Bulls must once again defend daily 8ema support at 443.04 tomorrow. If they can defend that support there is a chance they bounce back to 446.44 supply and close over that which would put them back in control. 

Bears need to close under daily 8ema support and will look to target a bigger drop to daily 20ema support near 440.23.

Taking a look here at NQ we have a similar combination of the ES and QQQ move here in that we once again saw a nice drop in daily buyers but we also backtested and rejected previous daily supply of 18582. 

With this being the 4th day in a row to test and reject this level and no daily buyers/ new demand to support further upside it is expected to look for a continuation to the downside. I have been looking for a backtest of 18275 since Friday also and I do think we see that and potentially could even over shoot it lower to the 18200 area. 

Bulls must once again defend daily 8ema support of 18441. There is also a daily inverted hammer candle in play here where we could see another overnight bounce and run at 18582. 

Bears have to close under daily 8ema support of 18441 to be in control. If they can break under that then their target will be daily 20ema support near 18275.

The VIX (which perfectly goes with SPY and QQQ) also has an absolutely ugly daily pattern here. We once again saw a strong bounce with a long wick to the downside off double demand at 12.79-12.91. We have still not put a new supply in here on the VIX either. 

Honestly the way these candles on SPY/ VIX along with the technicals have move all week long very much so seems like price wanted to go lower but someone or something kept it from doing that the last three days. 

With 12.79-12.91 defending and once again bouncing we will look to see if the VIX can finally target a move back up to 13.74 demand to take that level out. IF we cant break through that and EMAs then we will look to see if the bulls can get the VIX under this massive demand area from 12.07-12.91.

Today was once again an incredibly frustrating day of trading. I felt semi confident in a short overnight so much so that I took a short in my MFFU 30k static using 5 MES with a 10pt stop loss. I was expecting us to hold under previous days HOD but we ended up pushing up just far enough to stop me out. 

From there I had a quick morning short that I set a breakeven stop on that I was up 5pt instantly and then it hard wicked back up. I took another great short for a big win and then of course got wicked out basically at intraday HOD before we then started our move down. Because of the incredibly chop yesterday I didn’t trust the play to hold without setting an early stop loss which resulted in a small win before we saw the major drop EOD. 

I am not sure what happened to my internet EOD but I lost my wifi too so I couldn’t even attempt to trade the big drop. 

I ended up passing another 25k APEX Eval today as tomorrow is the last day for 80% off and one day pass so I wanted to take advantage of that. 

I am half way to passing another MFFU 50k eval too. I was in a short basically all day long and I needed a little bit more drop EOD. However, my ninja and connection was all kinds of messed up with the wifi issue so I ended up just closing for profit where I was at. If I had held for about 10 more minutes I would have passed that today. I do expect to pass that tomorrow or later this week.

906,"EV Minerals Unveils Promising Historic Results from EV Nickel Project in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region, Quebec","Last week, EV Minerals Corporation (Ticker: EVM.c) announced significant developments at its EV Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region, Quebec. Through a meticulous Phase 1 desktop compilation, the company has identified compelling North Zone drill targets, hinting at a potential expansion of resources.

https://preview.redd.it/lkgdv25qdrqc1.jpg?width=1176&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5afd92e11314ca86bdd6e1b56ab5d9852995605a

After completing its inaugural 13-hole drill program in 2023, EV Minerals is eagerly anticipating the imminent assay results. These results will provide valuable insights into the project with initial results already having revealed indications of semi-massive to massive sulphide mineralization. 

The  company plans to use the drill program and historic data compilation results for a follow-up drill program this year. 

Key findings from initial desktop compilation in the North Zone include:

*Expansive Resource Potential*: Highlights from the North Zone demonstrate robust potential for resource expansion through infill drilling, with the area remaining open to the north.

*Notable Intercepts*: Hole 89-MCN-132 revealed two wide zones with significant grades, including 0.03% Cobalt, 0.11% Copper, and 0.38% Nickel over 14.00 meters, and 0.04% Cobalt, 0.15% Copper, and 0.29% Nickel over 21.60 meters, with higher concentrations within.

*High-grade Nickel Pockets*: Hole 89-MCN-133 exhibited high-grade nickel concentrations, with 1.64% Nickel over 2.30 meters, among other notable intercepts.

*Multi-element Potential*: Several holes indicated potential for diverse mineralization, including copper, lead, and zinc.

*Advanced Data Analysis:* Comprehensive digitization of historic exploration data will facilitatthe creation of an interactive 3D model of the deposit, essential for planning future drilling programs and resource updates.

Nicholas Konkin, President and CEO of EV Minerals, expressed optimism, stating, ""Modern digitization of historic exploration data has provided valuable insights into areas for resource expansion. We are particularly encouraged by the numerous >1% nickel intercepts, guiding our strategic approach for future drilling and metallurgical testing.""

The EV Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project spans 1,792 hectares in the vicinity of Saguenay, Quebec, accessible via multiple forest service roads. With an undeveloped resource of 5.585 million tonnes, boasting grades of 0.21% Nickel, 0.11% Copper, and 0.03% Cobalt, the project holds promise.

910,High-risk High-reward Watchlist of the week - 3/27,"Good day to all! Our journey these last several weeks has been nothing short of amazing – our selections have really taken off. Yet, we've encountered a few letdowns along the way (transparency is key!). As such, view this watchlist with a grain of salt, and brace for high volatility when engaging with these tickers. Communicated disclaimer, this is not financial advice.

Quick overview: CHRO, KULR, BNNHF, & JEWL Let's dive into the details:

Leading our list, $**CHRO**:

* Reflecting on Chromocell Therapeutics Corporation’s ($CHRO) recent activity, with a close at $2.44 and a jump to $2.55 after hours (+4.51%), I’m anticipating a positive day ahead. I expect a potential increase of 3% to 5%, aiming for a closing price between $2.63 and $2.68. Why I’m bullish on $CHRO:
* The after-hours increase suggests a continuation of positive investor sentiment into the next trading session.
* The significant rise after the market suggests the momentum could carry into tomorrow, aiming for a similarly positive trajectory.
* Technical indicators often hint at the next day’s movement based on after-hours performance, painting a hopeful scenario for $CHRO.
* Considering the overall market trend and recent performance, there’s a strong case for continued optimism.
* A cautious yet optimistic forecast of a 3% to 5% increase aligns with the stock's positive after-hours behavior. Anticipating a favorable day for $CHRO.

Moving on to $**KULR**:

* After an eye-catching day that ended with KULR Technology Group, Inc. up 30.36% at $0.4238, followed by a 5.62% decline after hours to $0.4000, let's speculate on what tomorrow may bring for KULR:
* Predicting KULR’s direction post such a dynamic day is challenging; expect swings. The post-market retreat might reflect profit-taking after the day's surge or temporary market hesitations. Nevertheless, a recovery seems plausible, with an estimated 5% uptick, possibly closing around $0.4200. Rationale behind KULR’s potential recovery:
* The after-hours retreat could be seen as a market correction following a notable gain.
* KULR’s underlying momentum, supported by recent positive developments, suggests the potential for rebound.
* Given the day's volatility, more fluctuation is likely, yet the stock’s fundamental strengths may help it recover.
* KULR’s visibility has risen thanks to strategic partnerships, potentially buoying its performance despite short-term dips. Forecasting a rebound for KULR amidst volatility.

Next, $**BNNHF**:

* With Benjamin Hill Mining Corp. closing up at $0.4400 and a spike in trading activity, there’s a heightened interest that could signal further growth. A conservative estimate suggests a 2-5% increase, with a potential closing price around $0.45 to $0.46. Insight into BNNHF’s outlook:
* The positive close reflects a building momentum or response to recent developments.
* The surge in trading volume indicates growing attention and optimism for BNNHF’s prospects.
* As the company explores valuable resources, its performance may be influenced by market trends in these commodities.
* With recent positive news and strategic developments, BNNHF could see additional upward movement.

Finally, $**JEWL**:

* Adamas One Corp.’s significant 31.90% increase to close at $0.4300, followed by a slight after-hours gain to $0.4378, indicates strong momentum. Predicting a gain of 5-10%, we could see JEWL closing between $0.46 to $0.48. Reasons for optimism around JEWL:
* The post-market increase underscores continued investor interest.
* JEWL’s recent accolades and strategic milestones enhance its appeal and investor confidence.
* The stock’s vigorous performance suggests the possibility of maintaining its upward trajectory.
* Despite expected volatility, the prevailing bullish sentiment may continue to drive gains. JEWL seems set for further appreciation. Eager to hear your thoughts and to continue our successful run!

917,NxGen Brands Inc. Forecast to Deliver 140% Growth in Q1 2024,"Mad House Supps Brand on track for $1.3m in revenues for 2024

&#x200B;

Denver, Colorado--(Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2024) - NxGen Brands, Inc. (OTC Pink: NXGB) (""NxGen"" or the ""Company""), ([www.nxgenbrands.com](https://www.nxgenbrands.com)) confirms strong Q1 sales with month on month growth through massive increase in social media advertising presence for its Mad House Supps Brand ([www.madhousesupps.com](https://www.madhousesupps.com)). The newly released Protein product is slated to arrive this week, but is already sold out and new inventory is scheduled to be produced in April.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CEO, Joseph Lawanson, commented, ""At NxGen Brands we promised transparency and, with that in mind, I am pleased to bring you some in depth facts and figures about our progress with our brand Mad House Supps. There is a lot to take in, but I hope you appreciate that we are building something special here and we want to share our journey with shareholders as we continue with this successful growth plan we are delivering.""

&#x200B;

Q4 2023 revenue for the brand, prior to the sale to NxGen, was in the region of $86,000 as the brand was preparing to be sold, with inventory being run down in preparation for the sale. NxGen acquired the brand on Jan 1, 2024. Q1 2024 sales are forecast to show 140% growth and be in the region of $200,000, at the top-end of the forecast, for the first quarter as inventory comes back on stream again.

&#x200B;

Moving into Q2 of 2024, the growth in both direct to consumer as well as in the availability of existing and new stream products for retailers allows the company to forecast revenues of between $250,000 and $300,000, at the top-end of the stretch forecast.

&#x200B;

Direct to consumer growth is proving a real success point as revenues from social media advertising starts to come on stream. During this test phase of curating the best adverts, spend on social media advertising has ramped up to c.$15,000 per month and is attracting revenues close to $25,000 per month. The Company intends to invest heavily as it moves out of this testing phase of spending in this area. The budget in this advertising category is expected to be closer to $45,000 as it progresses through 2024, with projected revenues exceeding $75,000 per month from this source alone.

&#x200B;

The Australian licensee has also sold through most of their inventory and is now preparing a second production as sales throughout Asia-Pac begin to ramp up also. Mad House is sold under license from Australia and NxGen believes this is an area of exceptional non-US growth for the brand as it is increasingly seen internationally as the 'go-to brand' for customers. The Company expects revenues from this territory alone to be in excess of $350,000 per year as it approaches the latter half of 2024.

&#x200B;

The Company remains confident that it can deliver revenues from Mad House Supps in 2024 in excess of $1.3m both from its domestic audience but also from the growing international sales and licensing partners with whom it has contracts.

920,"Lets Roll the JPM Collar… 3-27-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Note- I will NOT be trading tomorrow because I will be traveling to see some family. Tomorrow is also quarterly option expiration so tread lightly! Don’t forget markets are closed Friday too! 

I know the question everyone is asking is “what does markets do on quarterly options expiration day?”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kxs9l6pd0yqc1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7938fdb13ba4e248b4c4e333a806aded09c8b26

If we look at previous quarterly days… all of 2023 we opened green, however all of 2022 we opened red. 

Now the last two quarterly days we have closed lower than open. However, the 4 quarterly days before that we have closed higher than open. 

We have only closed green two out of the last 9 quarterly options expiration days. This is why I say we should tread very lightly tomorrow if you are trading. The days are extremely unpredictable and whenever the collar rolls we are bound to get a very large movement during that time too. 

Looking forward to Monday (remember this is a three day weekend) we have opened red the last 4 times and closed lower the last two times. However, 5 out of 9 times we close higher than previous. 

Once again quarterly is so unpredictable its hard to find a good trend to play. Again my best recommendation is to take tomorrow off and enjoy a nice long 4 day weekend before we pick back up on Monday! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n0d6xlfe0yqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=716a5a8e8fefc676d45f202c5ed840465197d7e2

Event wise tomorrow along with quarterly options expiration we have major heavy hitting data both pre-market at 830am but also at 945am and 10am. All of this data has potential be market moving. 

Friday (remember markets are closed!) we have major data with CORE PCE at 830am and JPOW once again speaking Friday. This makes for a very interesting long weekend with markets and futures closed. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/699lcsse0yqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0703a4e5985f9109304e6dc3bf49e2f2c3cbaba1

Looking forward to next week since I wont be here tomorrow to post a weekly TA… we have MAJOR data next week too which is going to make for a wildly volatile week. Monday PMI is probably about the softest data we have of everything. But Tuesday through Friday premarket we have major economic data that we can certainly expect to move this market. 

Today was pretty much dejavu of yesterday. We had a very unsupported run up (not supported by daily technicals with buyers/ seller nor supply/ demand) and then that led to a major move opening hour which then led to nothing but tight range and directionless chop for the majority of the day. These days if you are trading options are designed to burn as many people as possible. 

I have got to say that EOD 35pt ES and 115pt NQ reversal was probably one of the more wild things I have seen lately in this market. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5px6c6f0yqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4afae5c6e89daaa31fbd22d443e938c0ce778faa

While I was generally looking for a breakdown today we undeniably are holding support incredibly well here. We refused to break through the daily 8ema support and now have put in a new demand at 518.84. While we did weaken daily sellers today and get a new daily demand. The one thing that I would have liked to see was a closure over 523.45 supply and daily buyers to feel 100% bullish. 

Tomorrow is quarterly options expiration and as you can see above its pretty unpredictable to what we might get tomorrow. 

However, in general I am fairly bullish for next week. 

Bulls need to see daily buyer come back in and close over 523.45 supply. If they do that then their upside target is 528-530. 

Bears have a small opportunity to reject this supply here at 523.45 while still having daily sellers. However, we are likely limited on the downside we will see as long as this 518.84 demand and support holds. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05 -> 523.45  
 Demand- 518.84

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

Looking at Es here we have an even more bullish looking chart here which to me shows potential for a big breakout tomorrow. As of right now we actually brought back in daily buyers (which is truly incredible because we were nearing sellers for a while today). We also put in a new daily demand at 5272. 

Despite the best efforts of the bears… they were once again not able to break through the daily 8ema support and were not able to today hold this much lower. With a closure over 5309 which is the double top supply from 3/21 and 3/22. This should lead to much like what we saw on 3/19 and 3/20 a large breakout tomorrow. 

Bulls will need to defend this 5309 support and then their upside target is 5322.75 which is ATHs but realistically bulls will target 5350. 

Bears only hope is a daily double top rejection here to then push back down to 5272 support/ demand. However, bears are not in control till we close under 5272 minimally. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5238 -> 5309  
 Demand- 5272

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0dsjxx4g0yqc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9f6bf1ff18f277b2b2402064023f1a45a13de87

Now when we look at QQQ and NQ markets are telling a completely different story. I mentioned earlier this week that NQ seemed to be (early on) the only thing that was keeping this market from a major sell off. However, today it was nearly the opposite. QQQ/ NQ took a major morning sell off which then of course brought ES down with it. Es today was far stronger than NQ and incredibly was able to pull NQ from the depths with it. 

Now looking at QQQ here honestly these daily candles are straight up ugly and completely senseless in all forms. 

Objectively looking at QQQ… we have stronger daily sellers today (despite closing red) which is an anomaly. We now have a triple top (and 4 days) in a row of rejecting pretty much exactly to the penny at 446.44 supply. We also from a supply and demand stand point are still in a pretty sizeable downward trajectory which in and of itself is all very bearish. If I was looking strictly on QQQ/ NQ and ignored ES/SPY it would be hard to deny how bearish everything looks. 

However, from a bullish stand point this is now the third day in a row (with stronger sellers) that markets have attempted to break through daily 8ema support and have been unable to do so. 

Bulls need to breakout massively over 446.44 supply (I wouldn’t much like 3/21) be surprised to see a huge gap up tomorrow. From there the upside target is 449.34 which is ATHs. 

Bears have a small opportunity here to hold and continue to reject 446.44. If they can do that and can close minimally under 443.3 (daily 8ema support) there is a potential downward move to be made.

Now very similarly here on NQ we had a major bounce off daily 8ema support and we did get a nice daily double bottom off yesterday candle too. However, we still did not get a new demand and we still did not close over previous supply of 18582.

I am still not quite sure what happened EOD but it was enough volume to be able to go from having daily sellers showing up on the daily for the first time in over a week to barely missing having stronger buyers coming in. From an outside perspective NQ is more bullish than QQQ is because it does have buyers but they are just weaker. 

Bulls need to find a new demand tomorrow and minimally need to close over 18581 which is the daily supply. From there the upside target is 18709 which is ATHs. 

Bears need to for the 6th day in a row tomorrow defend 18581 supply. If they can do that and can attempt to bring daily sellers in we may see once again a push back down to 18458 which is the daily 8ema support.

Taking a look at the 10YR yield here we are honestly sitting in a bit of a no mans land here. Last week we put in a new supply at 4.342% which makes 4.342-4.353% a major double supply and resistance area. 

Since then the 10YR has just slowly been working its way down and bouncing off the daily EMA supports. Until today the daily 50ema support has been strong support but we now closed under that level. IF this is truly a daily breakout on ES/ NQ then we should and could expect to see the 10YR continue to sell off which would bring it back down to previous major support of 4.08%.

Taking a look at the dollar here we are seeing a major difference in trend from the 10YR. While the 10YR appears to have clearly topped and is in a major downside move the dollar actually appears to be forming a major daily bull flag. 

Right now since early march DXY has been in a very strong upward trend. We put in daily demand and support at 104.227 yesterday but today we could not get through daily supply and resistance of 104.43. 

If we are going to see a major breakout in the markets (specifically tech) I would like to see DXY break under 104.227 demand. With this doji rejection off previous supply it is very probable that happens tomorrow.

I am zooming way out here on the VIX to show the overall trend that we are in right now and how significant some of these level are. 

If you guys remember earlier this year we had a time period where almost every single day the VIX trend with SPY and it didn’t matter. Right now the VIX is in a major downward trend as you can see. I mentioned this after FOMC last week but we had finally after almost 5 months of making higher lows on the VIX are in a downward trend on the VIX again. 

There is a major falling wedge that is forming which still opens up a move to a new 52 week (really 3-4 year) low. 12.44 is currently the strongest VIX level and the most important. After putting in a new supply today at 13.24 and hard rejecting the daily 8ema resistance I am looking for 12.07, 12.44 and 12.55 demands as potential downside targets. 

If the VIX closes under 12.07 we honestly could see the VIX head down near 10-11 as we likely continue to rally into the next CPI reading. 

The one thing I know is that the lower the VIX gets the less and less it correlates with the market and the less and less I plan to follow it.

Today was a whirlwind of a day honestly. I felt confident in a short overnight and I ended up shorting the MFFU eval I had gotten to 50% of yesterday. Thankfully I only did one contract and markets didn’t push up too high. I was able to average down on my short before the big morning dump which let me hit my profit goal and pass that MFFU account. This now gives me a $30k static and $50k funded account for MFFU. In addition I have multiple APEX accounts passed/ PAs. 

I took a great short this morning on ES that I really do wish I had just held for glory as it woulda been nearly a 15 pt win by time the downward move stopped. From there honestly I made two great choices today… the first one was shorting ES and the second one was stopping trading on my MFFU 30k static once I made that trade. 

From there honestly this day completely wrecked me and had me on the wrong side of every single move. I was completely caught off guard today by the utter strength (without support till literally final candle) of the bulls today. I was in a short (granted I got in way too low) but I was expecting a a major break flag breakdown around 1145am. We ended up getting the bearish engulfing candle that double top and rejected off the 15min 5ema with proper support and a new supply. However, no where did I expect that ES would then go on a major 10pt reversal out of now where. I ended up getting stopped out on my short (I had moved my stop loss up as I knew I had a low entry and still thought we would consolidate before dropping). 

I took another short which dumped a few pts and then came up and hit my breakeven stop. I was short right before the 1pm drop and once again expected fully that we were going to see downside continuation. 

I had thankfully switched over to an old APEX PA that already was low on its drawdown left and in the red PnL wise. I only had a little bit left and ended up going long (my last entry say short but it actually was a long). And of course we ended up dropping down into power hour and then we got the major breakout. I even called out that I was looking for a breakout and move to 5309 if we majorily broke out into the EOD. We of course had stop loss hunted all the longs first before the move happened. Again at this moment when I was long we had a major rejection and bounce off 15min 5ema support with a clear double bottom forming looking ready to push back up but it just completely lost all its support and dumped before the ridiculous pump EOD. 

Honestly today straight up owned me and most traders that I know. This sort of volatility and nonsense is honestly what I expect from quarterly opex tomorrow. I ended up losing the APEX PA which again I am not that hurt about as it was already in the red and the furthest from a payout. 

My 30k static is just a small about from getting a payout. I am going to continue to trade that Monday when I get back from my trip and will look to be able to request a payout sometime next week on that. The amazing thing about the 30k static is that the minimum payout request is $1000 and max is $3000. The coolest thing though is that unlike the other combines/ funded accounts being a static account my drawdown stays locked at $28500. Meaning the more you grow the account the bigger and bigger the drawdown you have grows. 

I am after a day like today completely looking forward to taking tomorrow off and enjoying a nice long 4 day weekend. I will come back Monday 100% refreshed ready to kill it. The last time I had an amazing run trading came right after quarterly options expiration.

925,Undervalued Gem - TA & Price Targets,"Happy Thursday, everyone—our week’s unofficial wrap! Today, I’m casting a spotlight on $BNNHF, a stock I believe is a bit of a market sleeper. Communicated disclaimer, this is not financial advice!

[prie targets in the chart image](https://preview.redd.it/j8mcal5eq2rc1.png?width=2834&format=png&auto=webp&s=f58f8b8e487b51dca00b5fb082d841cfdc47912d)

I’m forecasting that $BNNHF could soar to approximately $0.46 by day's end, based on its current traction and overall positive market trends.

Reasons for my optimistic stance:

1. **Recent Momentum**: $BNNHF has been on the move, clocking in an increase of $0.0116 or roughly 2.63% from its previous closing. This momentum is a strong indicator of its potential to maintain an upward trajectory today.
2. **Market Trends**: The general state of the market, and more specifically the mining sector's health, appears to be in $BNNHF's favor, suggesting a supportive backdrop for growth.
3. **Technical Indicators**: The stock is making a bullish exit from a supply zone aiming for the higher demand zone. To reach our goal, it must first surpass a few key levels, adding to the anticipation.
4. **Company News**: [like this](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/BNNHF/news/Benjamin-Hill-Announces-Closing-of-Oversubscribed-5-Million-Financing?id=434395)

With these factors in play, it looks like $BNNHF is set for a bright day ahead, at least in the near term.

Enjoy your Easter weekend!

929,Grid Battery Exploration Team Initiates Work on Clayton Valley Lithium Project Today,"Grid Battery Metals Inc. (Ticker: CELL.v or EVKRF for US investors) announced today that it has launched its 2024 Exploration Program at the Clayton Valley Lithium Project. The program commences with a Magnetotelluric (MT) geophysics survey conducted by KLM Geoscience, a Nevada-based industry leader in geophysical exploration.

https://preview.redd.it/goe2g6pgl5rc1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a092c3bbb0f0420198c0660da3f88d03c1b69778

The MT survey, utilizing advanced equipment and techniques, aims to identify potential lithium brine-containing strata, structural features that could concentrate brine, and basin floor geometry. With 85 station sites planned, the survey employs 100m inline and crossline electric field dipoles at a spacing of 250m and line spacings of 500m.

This initial phase will be followed by a detailed soil sampling program led by Rangefront Exploration. The combined results will inform the selection of drill targets for subsequent exploration phases later in the year.

Tim Fernback, President & CEO of Grid, highlighted the strategic location of the Clayton Valley Lithium Project, situated adjacent to Albemarle Corporation's Silver Peak Mine, North America's sole lithium brine producer.

Grid anticipates leveraging these survey results to advance its understanding of the lithium potential within Clayton Valley, positioning the company for further exploration and development opportunities in the region.

936,"$BIG has potential for BIG short squeeze, but also positives with company operations","$BIG operates discount and bargain stores.  A few years ago they lost their way and turned into just a basic retailer with maybe 10% bargains, they then benefited from the COVID spending surge, but the last couple years have had negative comps.  Management has been aggressive at unlocking value and also repositioning the company to be the bargain hunt store again, which is driving traffic gains and they expect to see same store sales flip back positive this year again.  Big Lots is also a decent furniture retailer and nationwide has some of the best prices on sofas/sectionals so there is plenty of room to grow their Broyhill Brand which they acquired and made exclusive to them.  

On the short sale front this stock has only has 29 million shares outstanding with a market cap of $125 Million.  6.6 Million shares are short, which is about 43% of the float.  The company in previous years has been aggressive at repurchasing and retiring shares, however they spent about $600 million doing that and many on shares with prices in the $40's and 30's per share.  They still have $159 million of authorization to repurchase shares, which would effectively take out the entire company at these prices.  With the retail slowdown they have hunkered down and reduced their dividend and also curbed repurchases as they focused on operations.  The company really should dial down on repurchases here and not wait.  An activist investor Mill Road Capital popped up and acquired 5% odf the company at an average of $20 per share in 2022, they were pushing for a full on sale and expecting value of $55-70 per share in an outright sale.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/mill-road-calls-for-a-sale-of-big-lots-heres-what-we-might-learn-from-the-firms-earlier-deals.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/mill-road-calls-for-a-sale-of-big-lots-heres-what-we-might-learn-from-the-firms-earlier-deals.html)  If you look at some of the key points Mill Road brought up, management has addressed them such as freeing up tied up capital in sale leasebacks of distribution centers and owned stores primarily in California as well as repositioning the company as the bargain store.  If you have a Big Lots in your area, feel free to stop by and check their furniture prices and also values and I think you'll personally be impressed as well.  

The problem has been that hedge funds keep shorting the stock with Fintel data supporting more short sales consistently in FINRA volume.  A lot of the ""analysts"" also following the stock are also just further mouthpieces for their short hedge fund clients. With the low float and a pick up in momentum the potential for a very big short squeeze exists,  institutions also own a good amount of shares outstanding and may be encouraged to add to upward pressure now that end of the quarter windowdressing and reporting are behind them.   A comparison to a heavily shorted stock is $CVNA, where the stock price went from $6 to $90 due to the persistent short activity, it's possible BIG produces a big return, but would be more fairly valued in the range Mill Road was pushing for a sale at, even a small short squeeze could produce a significant return considering how much the stock price has been beaten down by the shorts.

942,Method Staking $1000 per week,"Hi, I want to share with you one crypto method I found on one of the paid forums

I've been doing cryptocurrency staking for a long time and I can say that this is one of the best and stable methods I have ever seen

I'm not encouraging anyone to repeat after me, just sharing a type of making money from cryptocurrency

I used a capital of **$800** and in a day I earned about **\~$100 per day**

So, the method itself (I'll just copy it from the main source and change it a bit for better understanding)

In short, we get **0.5%** when using the **EOS network** on the **MEXC exchange**

**Steps:**

**1)** Registration on the **MEXC exchange**

**2)** Deposit **USDT**

**3)** Buy **EOS** for **USDT**

**4)** Go to **Wallet** \> **Spot** \> **EOS** \> **Deposit**

**5)** Copy **EOS MEMO**

**6)** Step back > **Withdraw**

**7)** Fill in the fields as follows:

&#x200B;

* Address: **mexc.eos**
* Network: **EOS**
* Memo: **Copied memo**. Important! You must specify each time!
* Amount: **Test on small amount** (but consider the 0.1EOS commission)

**8)** Send and wait **±10m**

**9)** Getting the entire amount back, but with an **additional 0.5%**

**10**) Repeat everything from **step 4**

Thus, with each transaction, we increase our capital by **0.5%**. It's not a bad method. But it takes a lot of time to work with it

I can throw in a **VIDEO** of the method working, for better understanding",1711821515,823440,Mechelle_Buechel,t2_smad2sbk,38b59de483a72ae9f66feca8ea6b123bb0cb7d5c239fbb03f46fd0d7f034c6a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1brnynj/method_staking_1000_per_week/

944,ROOT Squeeze: Incoming Parabolic Move?,"Since ROOT's earnings call on Wednesday, February 22nd, where they announced a remarkable turnaround from losses to break-even adjusted  EBITDA and robust growth, ROOT has embarked on an extraordinary, facing-ripping rally, soaring from **$8 to $61.50 in just 26 trading days.**

Now, it's a well-known knowledge  that what goes up rapidly often comes down just as swiftly, if not faster, hence the saying *""bulls take the stairs up, bears take the elevator down.""* 

We've all seen it happen time and again, especially with stocks  experiencing meteoric rises like ROOT, particularly given its limited  float.

But guess what? Not this time around. **ROOT has defied the odds by consolidating its gains.**

Dive into the charts and you'll see a consolidation phase between the $37-48 range from March 4th to March 14th, followed by breakout movements on the 15th and 18th,  propelling the stock to a 52-week high of $61. 

The next day, a substantial sell-off ensued, dropping the price to a low of $46, only to rebound to $53 the next day. This indicates short sellers covering their positions and smart buyers  seizing the opportunity to grab shares at this pivotal $40\~ range.

In the subsequent five trading days, ROOT continued its consolidation  within the $50 to $59 range before shattering the crucial $59-60  resistance level on Friday. 

**This breakout has left many short sellers, who initiated positions below these levels trapped and scrambling to  cover, intensifying their plight.**

&#x200B;

[Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/2m9qfm764jrc1.png?width=2678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e9f15c56a68bed0d9ad9cca3ab5b6b9f048c51b)

**On March 15th**, [NASDAQ data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/root/short-interest) indicates that **1.4  million shares are short**, representing approximately 21.74% of the short  float. 

**Since March 15th**, more shorts have foolishly piled and **short interest has increased significantly**, with a total of **3,956,808 shares sold short**, a substantial figure considering  the total available shares for trading is only around **6.49 million.**

>Assuming conservatively that 40% of the nearly 4 million shares sold short since March 15th and 80% of the 1.4 million shares sold short before that date have covered, we're looking at **approximately 2,656,330 shares still short**, translating to a **41% short interest.**

ROOT's current price of $61.08 is teetering near its 52-week high, leaving short sellers with **substantial paper losses and limited options for exit**. 

**This heightened short interest, coupled with ROOT's formidable  technical and fundamental strengths, spells trouble for short sellers.**

[Short data as of Thursday, 3\/28](https://preview.redd.it/hr18rsipxirc1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=2982e933f490e36b9e51c3e5141936e0c4c448e0)

**Technical Analysis:**

* The breach of the key $59-60 resistance level on Thursday signals trouble for short sellers. 
* With ROOT closing at $61.08 on Thursday, essentially at its 52-week high, short sellers are facing a grim reality.
* **As a result, numerous short sellers who initiated positions (41% of the total float - estimated) within the past three weeks are now underwater and trapped. Moreover, new  short sellers who entered the market on Thursday are also facing considerable pressure.**
* They're staring at substantial paper losses and finding themselves unable to close their positions.
* This inability to exit positions is attributed to ROOT's robust fundamentals, along with a narrow bid-ask spread, relatively low trading volume, and limited float.
* ROOT's substantial insider and institutional holding, accounting for 48%, further restricts the available supply.
* These factors collectively defy conventional market forces and contribute to sustaining ROOT's upward momentum. This predicament could force Thursday's short sellers to either increase their  positions at higher prices or close their positions  altogether creating a bigger upwards movement.    

**Fundamental Analysis:**

* **Business Turnaround:**  With break-even adj. EBITDA   and robust growth, ROOT's Q4 quarter has  left the market stunned. They   went from a business staring at bankruptcy  to one that is break-even   and will see profitability soon.   
* **Healthy Financials**:     Root boasts about $500   million in unencumbered cash, generating     interest for the company.   This financial flexibility virtually     eliminates bankruptcy concerns.   Q4 2023 saw a $5 million increase,     further solidifying Root's   stability.    
* **Leading Tech:**  In an industry ripe for innovation,   ROOT has the edge for sustained  success due to its mobile app that   collects driving data on breaking,  speed of turns, times of the  day,   miles driven, and driving routes.  Root doesn’t exclusively price car   insurance based on pricing, but the  driving test has about a 40%    weight in their models. It has a  proprietary claims system and machine   learning, allowing for automated  loss expense, fast claims payout, and   thus higher customer satisfaction.   
* **Outperforming Competitors:** When compared to Lemonade (LMND), ROOT boasts faster growth and higher profitability, yet **trades at a 85%  discount.** 
* **Operating Loss Improvement**:     Root achieved a   remarkable 74% improvement in operating loss,     decreasing from $48   million in Q4 2022 to $12 million in Q4 2023. This     substantial   improvement indicates enhanced operational efficiency and     cost   management initiatives undertaken by the company.   
* **Net Combined Ratio Enhancement**:     The net   combined ratio improved by 68 points to 112% in Q4 2023.  This metric is   crucial in the insurance industry as it measures the     relationship   between incurred losses and expenses to premiums earned. A     lower   combined ratio indicates improved underwriting profitability,     which   suggests that Root's pricing and underwriting enhancements are       effectively mitigating risks and driving profitability.   
* **Policy Growth and Premium Expansion**:     Root   experienced  significant growth in policies-in-force, which    surged    by 55% to 341,764  in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year.    This    robust policy growth is  indicative of increasing customer    adoption   and  market acceptance of  Root's insurance offerings.    Moreover,   gross  premiums written more than  doubled to $279 million,      reflecting strong  demand for Root's products  and services.   
* **Impressive Growth Metrics**:     In Q4 2023, Root   demonstrated exceptional growth, with a 74%     improvement in operating   loss compared to the previous year. The net     combined ratio  improved  significantly, reflecting enhanced underwriting      profitability.   
* **Strategic Partnerships**:     Carvana, a major   investor in Root, leverages Root's embedded   insurance   tech to offer   car insurance directly to consumers. With   Carvana  holding 6 million   shares, their partnership bolsters Root's   market  presence.   
* **Expansion Plans**:  During Wednesday's earnings call,   CEO Alex Timm revealed that they have  signed new embedded insurance   partnerships in Q4, signaling further     growth potential.     
 

**Summary:**

**In summary, the current situation resembles a powder keg with a strip of Scotch tape barely holding the lid in place.** 

But as the pressure mounts, the eventual release could be **explosive**. 

With short sellers feeling the squeeze and ROOT's undeniable strengths, we're on the brink of a monumental event: the grand short squeeze, potentially leading to a jaw-dropping **50-100% surge in price.**

950,Humanoid robot industry in 2024: Nvidia / WiMi are coming in AI industry," 

On March 27, China’s Zhejiang Humanoid Robot Innovation Center released the universal humanoid robot “Pilot 1”. It is understood that the release of the “Pilot 1”, on the basis of Zhejiang University humanoid robot “Wukong 4.0” for a new upgrade, innovative put forward the mechanism control, imitation learning and reinforcement learning integration methods.

**The general humanoid robot “Pilot 1” was unveiled**

The Pilot 1 is 150cm tall, weighs 50kg, has 39 degrees of freedom, and has a 4kg single-arm load. Equipped with 4 color cameras, 2 RGBD cameras, 2 IMUs, and an edge computing power of 275 TOPs. The whole system is fully independently developed, and the hardware end is equipped with a self-developed new planetary reducer, lightweight human robot arm and multi-freedom dexterous hand.

In addition, “Pilot 1” builds a model-free end-to-end servo control, which does not rely on large models or object models, and can also dynamically adapt to the environment operation, get rid of the dependence on cloud computing power, and making the local deployment of the algorithm more convenient.

In fact, since 2006, the team has developed a small human football robot; from 2008 to 2011, the team developed a table tennis human football robot that can play 145 rounds and can adapt to the front and back beat and spin the ball. Since then, the team has begun to study a new generation of indoor and outdoor fast and robust walking humanoid robots that can adapt to a variety of terrain, thrust disturbances, and dynamic obstacle avoidance

At present, humanoid robots benefit from technical support, application scenario expansion and user experience improvement, technological progress promotion and organizational digital transformation, and have great potential for future development. It is worth mentioning that on March 24, the launching ceremony of Heilongjiang Intelligent Robot Industry-University-Research-Application Alliance (hereinafter referred to as “Alliance”) led by Harbin Institute of Technology was held.

Recently, the “Dream Team” of nine different humanoid robots was just unveiled at the GTC conference of Nvidia (NVDA)  in 2024, inspiring technology enthusiasts from all over the world. At the event, Huang launched the Project GR00T, a general basic model of humanoid robots, and a new humanoid robot computer Jetson Thor based on the NVIDIA Thor system-level chip (SoC).

In addition, several humanoid machines can complete a variety of difficult movement instructions, whether it is juice, housework, dancing, drums, the robot can cope with. Huang said: ” The next generation of robots may be humanoid robots, because more imitation training data can be provided to machines who are similar to us. Humanoid robots can be deployed more efficiently in human-designed workstations, manufacturing, and logistics processes.”

**The improvement of the WiMi industry chain**

Not only that, compared with many industry pioneers, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), as a leading full-stack interactive AI solution provider, has a strong technical team and a rich product line. At the same time, WiMi has accumulated several years of technology in the field of humanoid robots, and has rich research and development experience and technology depth. Seeking full-stack solutions to meet the needs of enterprise-level users, it will usher in broad development opportunities.

In fact, WiMi has a strong industrial foundation and research and development technology. At present, the whole industry chain of robots has begun to take shape, which has laid a solid foundation for the development of humanoid robots. The essence of humanoid robot is the combination of “AI +”, and AI algorithm and computing chip are the main bottleneck for the commercialization of humanoid robot. WiMi may build a robot algorithm computing power platform, enable AI for the entire industry, and drive more manufacturers to try to use large models to train embodied robots and accelerate commercial implementation.

It can be said that WiMi makes full efforts in the humanoid robot track, constantly promotes the key tasks and objectives of humanoid robot, achieves more landmark achievements, and accelerates the continuous breakthrough and innovation of humanoid robot technology.

961,Binance Arbitrage - 10% per day,"Hi, I want to share with you a Binance method that I found on the vastness of Facebook. I have done arbitrage before and quite successfully, but this method broke all records regarding the daily spread.

I am not forcing anyone to use it! Rather, I want to show by the example of this method how you can make money in crypto.

I used a capital of 800$ and in a day I earned about 300$ in 24h of work. I would not say that the work is the most fun, but with such a spread why not.

So, the method itself (I'll simplify it a bit. If you need the full tutorial, I can send to **PM**)

In short, we will earn **0.5%** for each transaction to the IOST network. For this we will use their coin IOST.

**Steps:**  
1) Buy a **IOST coin**  
2) Then go to **Wallet, Spot** and select the purchased **IOST**  
3) Select **Deposit** and **copy MEMO** (It's important to specify every time  
4) Go back and select **Withdraw**  
5) Enter the blockchain address **iostcold**  
6) Enter the copied MEMO  
7) Choose a small amount of coins for the test  
8) And after 5-10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only **0.5%** (in coins)

If anyone has been helped, you can throw me a couple bucks for coffee)",1711998663,823502,Mechelle_Buechel,t2_smad2sbk,4967b164b78aa24a60af58fa97e6f7e23e86059b69403bccc7f5c753a68c8aba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1btclf5/binance_arbitrage_10_per_day/
962,"Happy April Fools Day! 4-1-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

The markets opened last night on the backs of the Friday PCE/ JPOW interview and went on a massive 120pt NQ and 24pt ES rally pretty much instantly after opening. This left a major downside gap to be filled. The joke was on bulls this time though as that HOD seen last night at opening would prove to be the top and pave way for the bears to once again take it lower. We are starting to see a major theme of overnight run ups on unsupported daily technicals that lead to intraday weakness. 

I was gone on Thursday for quarterly options expiration day thankfully as that proved to be one of the tightest ranged OPEX days we have seen.

As we look forward to the rest of the week we have a lot to look forward to. Tomorrow brings JOLTS data. JPOW once again is scheduled to speak on Wednesday and then we will round the week out Thursday and Friday with more economic and jobs related data. 

&#x200B;

One of the biggest stories this morning was the fact that the fed swaps are starting to price in less that 50% odds of a rate cut in June… now when we look at the CME fedwatch tool we still have 56.9% odds as of middle to EOD… This is a developing change and something to watch. With such heavy hitting economical data this week we could easily see this change and also see heavy volatility. 

If we continue to see extremely strong economical data then the odds of a rate cut in June is likely to continue to fall… The stronger the economy the less likely the fed is to cut early…. Also the stronger the job and labor market the harder it is going to be to get inflation down. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u78fn1uxdxrc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a32bd6623e589cd69f09047c4e782bd727c2e4

Taking a look at SPY here on Thursday we were not able to breach the critical 523.45 supply that we put in back on 3/21/24. The bulls once again attempted to break over that today and fell short. With this rejection we have actually reconfirmed 523.45 as our supply. This is a major bearish move here on the backs of also having stronger daily sellers today on SPY. 

However, despite the new supply and stronger daily sellers we once again were not able to break under the daily 8ema support. SPY realistically for the last 8 trading days now has closed inside a range of 518.76-523.45. Realistically if we close over 523.45 with stronger buyers we likely will look at ATHs and a sizeable 5%+ breakout. IF we close under 518.76 with sellers continuing to be stronger we should look for minimally daily 20ema support near 517.05.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 517.05 -> 523.45  
 Demand- 512.78 -> 518.76

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Looking at ES Futures we also failed to breakout on Friday over the previous supply of 5309. This actually led to a really nice daily double top doji rejection. Truthfully from a technical stand point it did not make much sense to see that major gap up Sunday night as we should have likely seen downside which did end up coming. 

Much like SPY though despite the rejection and reconfirmation of 5309 supply we have not been able to break and hold under daily 8ema support. ES continues to chop in a range of 5272-5309. Interestingly enough of ES, SPY, QQQ and NQ this is the only one that does not have daily sellers currently. 

IF we close over 5309 I will look for a breakout to the 5350+ area. IF we close under 5272 we are looking at daily 20ema support near the 5238 supply area. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5238 -> 5309  
 Demand- 5186 -> 5272

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

We are seeing a bit of a divergence here on Qs compared to the other three in that QQQ actually put in a new demand today at 443.94. 

The Qs continue to range in the same range of 433.84-446.44 for the last 27 days now. That is some major consolidation here on QQQ. On top of that for the last 7 trading days we have seen QQQ tireless attempt to breakout and close over 446.44 supply but has continue to fall short of that level. We continue to see daily sellers that are once again stronger today. 

Much like on SPY/ Es though despite the lack of upside movement here we also continue to see the daily 8ema support hold. QQQ has found itself for the last 7 days from 443.31 to 446.44. If we close over 446.44 with daily buyers coming in then I would target ATHs and a breakout to the 455 area. IF the bears can close under 443.31 then our downside target would be the bigger range support of 433.84 near the daily 50ema support. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 446.44  
 Demand- 443.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vb2xt4yydxrc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb8ba39eae62083a9cefcc0040dadff8d649caf

Despite the fact that QQQ got a new demand today and we saw NQ threaten to get a demand today in the end it did not hold support high enough to put in that demand. Similarly here on NQ we once again attempted to breakout over 18582 supply and failed yet again. With stronger daily sellers here on NQ also we are still looking for our breakout or breakdown. The daily 8ema support has continued to be the bulls last stand and they have defended that well for the last 5 trading days. 

The last 7 trading days have all closed as daily doji candles and they have all closed inside a range of 18462-18582. I have ultimate support at 18400 that if we close under that we will likely target a move to at least 18300 and potentially as low as previous double demand/ support of 18053-18072. To the upside if bulls can bring back in daily buyers and close over 18582 then my target is a breakout to 18800-19000 into EOM. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18582  
 Demand- 18053 -> 18072

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

The VIX had an impressive daily bounce today and honestly with the way the 10yr, DXY and VIX looked today I am a bit taken back that we saw such a relatively flat day in the markets. With the three of them being pretty bring green and daily sellers on three of the four charts I am shocked we didn’t have a more sizeable sell off. 

Thursday the VIX put in a new daily demand at 12.78 which actually reconfirmed previous daily demand. We now have SPY and ES reconfirming their previous supplies and  VIX reconfirming its previous demand. The VIX did leave a pretty strong gap down below and a longer wick to the upside. Bears would have preferred to seen a continuation candle not a possible reversal doji back down on VIX here.

Upside target for a major breakdown of this range would be 14.75-15.54 on the VIX. IF the bulls can defend EMA resistances here and move us back to the low 13s we very well might breakout of the upper side of the range.  

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

After the 10YR showing much more weakness than DXY the last two weeks we finally saw a major breakout on the 10yr. This likely comes on the backs of the markets starting to price in the fact that we are likely not getting three rate cuts and likely not getting our first cut in June. 

The 10yr now once again faces major double supply resistance of 4.341-4.353%. If we see the 10YR close and breakout over that then 4.41% to 4.475%. 

Bulls need to reject and head back to 4.206% to be back in control. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.341 -> 4.353 -> 4.475%  
 Demand- 4.08 -> 4.206 -> 4.41%

The dollar has continued to show strength for the last month straight now and today had one of its biggest breakouts. We closed over previous supply and resistance of 104.43 on Thursday. Since then we have popped through another supply/ resistance of 104.854 and taken out previous demand of 105.086. With a closure over 105.854 this gives us the highest close since November 13th 2023. 

Next major upside resistance for markets to watch is 105.927-106.135 which dates back to early November. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.854 -> 105.927  
 Demand- 104.227 -> 104.415 -> 106.135

As I mentioned I didn’t trade Thursday as I was traveling so there is no log from Thursday to report. 

Last night I noticed that despite the big pop up at open daily wise on ES and NQ we had zero support and justification for that move. This led me to short one NQ contract and hold that basically till open. I took about 1k profits (hit my stop) on the massive 15min opening candle on NQ… with again no justification for being green I shorted again to hit my 3k profit on the eval… I now am back to 3 MFFU accounts. Two 50k funded and one 30k static. 

I only traded my 30k static today and only found one trade I liked. I took a morning short around just before 10am. I ended up seeing about 6 pts of profit before it reversed on me. I was hoping to ride the short much lose down to at least 5300 but we pushed back up too much for me to be able to ride it further. Honestly I just couldn’t find anything the rest of the day that made sense to trade. I don’t trade continuation candles in this choppy market anymore and the only really good backtest we had and rejection at 1245 I missed my entry on. All in all im happy to start the week off green and if I can see $600 more in my 30k static account I will be able to request a payout this week!

976,ARLSF Looks Good for a Datytrade - CHart and Analysis Below,"Evening! ARLSF is on my watchlist for tomorrow’s day trading scene! Plus, I’ll be diving deeper into the company’s details soon. Considering its potential, it looks like it might be a solid pick for both short-term trades and as a speculative long-term investment. Communciated disclaimer, this is not financial advice.

Here’s my rationale for leaning into ARLSF right now:

* **Recent Gains**: ARLSF ended its last session on a high note, up by 7.10%. This sort of momentum typically draws more eyeballs and interest, potentially boosting its price further as the market buzz grows.
* **Impressive Growth**: The stock’s year-to-date increase of 177.67% showcases a strong vote of confidence from the investment community, hinting at a continued uptrend.
* **Positive Sector Vibes**: ARLSF sits in the agricultural inputs and basic materials sector, which currently enjoys a wave of optimism. The positive sentiment surrounding its sector could act as a tailwind for the stock.
* **Technical Standpoint**: While I don’t have the latest charts in front of me, the general rule of thumb is that stocks like ARLSF, with a history of strong performance, are likely to keep up their momentum, thanks to trends and market psychology.
* **Market Activity**: The action seen in ARLSF’s last trading day—significant volume coupled with positive price movement—often signals a stock's potential to keep rising in the next sessions.

Looking at these points, it seems we’re at a good jumping-on spot. More detailed thoughts to follow tomorrow morning!

1. It depletes the soil
2. Pollutes the environment
3. And contributes to climate change.

That’s why Argo Living Soils Corp is the game changer. Before I get into the company's details, I want to point out that $ ARLSFis has increased 300% in the last six months, and for good reason.

* People are starting to catch on about the dehydration of our topsoil
* Plant-based foods are exploding in popularity
* Recent Achievements and Biochar’s Expanding Horizon

**The Due-Diligence**

Argo specializes in producing and developing organic products, including soil amendments, living soils, biofertilizers, vermicompost, and compost extracts formulated specifically for high-value crops. The Company’s vision and overall business plan is to create an established organic and environmentally friendly product brand. Founded in 2018, Argo has expanded and relocated its production facilities to Duncan, British Columbia, in a joint venture with Pacific Composting.

Argo uses the pyrolysis process to convert organic biomass (such as wood chips, crop residue, or manure) into carbon-rich biochar, a specific type of charcoal. Biochar is a carbon-rich organic material generated without oxygen to improve soil nutrient availability, aeration in soil, and soil water filtration.

Argo’s Products:

* Enable plants to reach full growth potential

982,Bullish on ARLSF - Due Diligence,"Morning folks - Here's the deep dive on $ARLSF I promised. Check out the details below and let’s discuss! Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

**Overview**Argo Living Soils Corp (ARLSF on OTC, ARGO on CSE) stands at the vanguard of the regenerative agriculture movement. Founded in 2018 in Duncan, British Columbia, Argo advocates for the adoption of organic fertilizers and soil amendments, aiming to enhance soil health, biodiversity, and crop quality while curtailing environmental impacts, embodying a movement rather than merely a business.

**Financials**ARLSF has showcased an extraordinary growth path. Since our initial mention in February, investors have enjoyed a staggering 316% growth over six weeks. With the stock’s price navigating the $0.15 to $0.19 range, it seems set for even higher climbs, indicating Argo's burgeoning role in a growing industry.

**Interesting Info**The importance of Argo’s mission becomes starkly apparent against the dramatic statistic of 57 billion tons of topsoil lost from the U.S. Midwest, underscoring the critical need for Argo’s living soils solution. This approach promises a sustainable coexistence of agriculture and nature, mitigating the reliance on destructive agricultural chemicals.

**Reasons to Consider Argo Living Soils**

* **Ascending Stock**: ARLSF’s rising stock is a beacon of its latent potential.
* **Addressing Soil Erosion**: Argo offers a sustainable answer to a global crisis.

989,"Is This Time Different… 4-2-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

After yesterdays intraday sell off to close on daily 8ema support it really was 50/50 on whether or not the bulls would continue to buy the dips overnight or not. However, this time (and one of the only times in the last few weeks) the bears actually took control overnight. We once again had a very large VIX spike and 10YR Yield spike which led to a breakdown in the market. ‘

Of course though instead of getting a nice and tradeable trend day we were once again left with a quick morning move that led to stop loss hunting chop into EOD. This market truly continues to be extremely difficult to trade intraday. Looking at it I think the last true “trend” day that we had was on March 19th. Before that it looks like the last trend day was March 7th. Almost every single day lately has been choppy and tight range consolidation for a majority of the day. 

Truly trading this market the last month has been so frustrating with this directionless chop… 

&#x200B;

Tomorrow is once again a big data day with ADP nonfarm at 815am, PMI at 945 and 10am and then we round it off with JPOW speaking at 1210pm. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s74c7yjci4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa967a2bea39ab55b487e819a4892db997660127

Dating back to October 2023 we have seen eight other times that ES has come down to the daily 20ema support. Every single time we have touched that daily 20ema support (and even come close to it) the following day has been a daily double bottom and breakout. IF we hold that trend tonight into tomorrow we would be looking at the ninth time this has occurred in just under 6 months. 

Fun Fact… in 2024 SPY has only closed 1% or less 3 times. The last time it closed 1% or lower was on March 5th, February 13th and January 31st. Even more fun fact is that each time we closed 1% or lower the next day SPY was green averaging a move of 0.91% green. 

Realistically going into tomorrow from a technical stand point bears have a major opportunity (once again) but from a historical perspective we should expect bulls to buy the dip here off support. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91wf7lxci4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d97c0bbb00430cbcdecffe584c04c8065b9451c

From a technical perspective today honestly is a major win for the bears. We have a support line on the daily and weekly timeframe for this 5 month long bull channel that was breached today. We also closed below the daily 8ema support for the first time since 3/15/24. However, while we continue to see stronger daily sellers, and closed below daily 8ema. We once again could not close below the daily 20ema support and that once again has become ultimate bull support for the last 5 months. Despite bears best efforts they could also not close below 518.76 demand. 

We did finally take out my lower target of 517.05 supply today too. However, with this massive hammer candle I am certainly looking for a bullish day tomorrow and potentially even a sizeable gap up. 

Bears will target continuation to the next lower demand/ support which is 512.78. However, bears need to see daily sellers on SPY continue to strength and need to finally see a closure below daily 20ema support of 516.27. 

Bulls must defend daily 20ema support here and retake daily 8ema resistance of 520 minimally tomorrow. If they retake the daily 8ema resistance then we likely will put a new demand in off todays candle and will look for a breakout to 523.45 supply and range resistance. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 523.45  
 Demand- 512.78 -> 518.76

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

We finally after almost 3 week of only seeing buyers on ES saw daily sellers return to the market today. We also closed below daily 8ema support and below previous demand/ support of 5272. 5272 demand was a major support level I wanted to watch for a break of. With that break we came down to daily 20ema support as I suspected and took out supply at 5238. 

We now have a decision time tomorrow. With historically over the last 5 months the daily 20ema support has always been support and ultimately bulls last stand. If that trend holds then we will look for a daily double bottom and push back over daily 8ema resistance of 5275 and previous demand of 5272. However, if that trend does not continue then 5229 is daily 20ema support. If that is closed under then our target is next daily demand of 5285. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5309  
 Demand- 5185 -> 5272

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/199uxnndi4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f994ae9cb83f51434d050fed6a2ab84ff4499fc

Truly the trend here on QQQ continues to be straight ugly and just nonsense in my opinion. We had that massive doji yesterday and bounce off daily 8ema support we ended up seeing a major gap down on the daily. This not only put us through daily 8 and 20ema support but completely gapped us below it. 

I mentioned yesterday that QQQ effectively for the last 2 weeks has traded inside a range of 443.3 to 446.44. Today we officially broke that range to the downside and put in a new daily supply at 444.95. The one thing that is actually interesting about QQQ today though is that daily sellers weakened ever so slightly. Despite the breaking of range support we are also seeing a pretty impressive hammer candle here which also leads to the potential of a sizeable gap up and green day tomorrow. 

QQQ and NQ also broke major daily and weekly supports for this 5 month long bull channel today too. 

Bears will look to use this break of the 2 week long consolidation to take us to the lower end of the macro range support which is 433.84. 

Bulls need to gap fill tomorrow and minimally close back over daily 20ema resistance of 441.16. If they can close over daily 8ema resistance of 442.85 then the target will be major double supply resistance and range resistance of 444.95-446.44.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 444.95 -> 4446.44  
 Demand- 433.84 -> 443.94

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rhn5mvaei4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13a92c0551e758a14a7319cc249a57ba2472e434

We once again saw stronger daily sellers come in on NQ today. We also broke the major consolidation range of 18463 to 18581 on the daily timeframe today also. Despite the bulls best efforts and fight intraday the bears were still able to close us below the daily 20ema support of 18325. 

Going into today my target was support at 18325 as that was the daily 20ema support and also was the red bear channel support before today moved that lower. Bears completely shot through that and finally backfilled the entire FOMC pump from last week. 

Bears have an opportunity to take this lower back to macro range support and double demand of 18053-18072. 

Bulls need to find a double bottom and minimally close over daily 8ema resistance of 18425 to be back in control. From there the target is 18582 supply and range resistance. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 18582  
 Demand- 18053 -> 18072

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m2sh79oei4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=60808a9a3319d0068f88e0294ac55b44e0b93e33

The VIX from low on Thursday to todays HOD had a total move of 20%. This is the biggest short term move to the upside on the VIX since February 9th to 13th. Funny enough if we look at the structure of those three days and compare it to today it is eerily similar. Oddly enough, despite a 20% pump on the VIX in three days SPY has barely been able to fall 1% over that time period. During that February move we saw SPY fall about 2% during that move. 

The VIX broke out of the major falling wedge I mentioned last week and came up to that critical supply and resistance levels of 14.75 and 15.54 that I mentioned were critical resistance yesterday. 

However, with this large wick and rejection off 14.75 supply its hard to feel bearish going into tomorrow. If this pattern plays out similarly to the February 9th to 13th pattern and this plays out historically like every other time when we bounced off daily 20ema support we should be looking at a pretty sizeable breakout tomorrow on the markets and a big dump on the VIX. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/33m3ai1fi4sc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=291ce065f5a05d7bece0767ae9e2ec68cf525008

Today was a brutal day of trading. We had such an incredible move down over night and then from there we once again was left with nothing but chop to trade. Absolutely brutal intraday trading lately. I swear one could legitimately pick a direction over night and have just as good as odds with a generous stop loss. There just barely is anything left intraday anymore. I tried to play the trend today which was bearish since we opened red and had all the support from bears and boy did that not go well… Truly it is frustrating playing shorts in this market. 

I don’t hate any of my plays today…  I tried to play the initial break through of ORB support and got reversed… had a few other times I tried to play 15min double tops/ bottoms that either failed to continue or reversed before I could see profits. The EOD pump was the worse as I was in a short and expected 5251/18292 resistance that held basically for 2.5 hours to continue to hold and to take us lower. However, we ended up getting that major pump which unfortunately killed my 30k static. I was trying to hold a short with conviction as from what I saw everything said we were going to reject and retest support not breakout like we did. In the end bears like usual got squeezed and couldn’t continue. 

Note- my trading log reflects my 30k static that blew but ninja deletes MFFU accounts instantly after they blow so its not shown here. 

I did end up getting into a few shorts and longs on NQ in two of my other funded 50k accounts during opening hour… I was able to take a bigger win in one to close the day up about $1100 and in the other I recovered it to close the day up $500. This certainly softens the blow that my 30k account took today. 

Honestly the issue today (and really for a while now) is that ES just didn’t move enough to win. I am again tempted to trade NQ. NQ price action has been far better looking for weeks now. Even inside of a range it at least gives us enough points to make it worth our while. 

On to tomorrow. IF this price action holds true… we should see a sizeable breakout tomorrow.

990,Abitibi Metals' (AMQ.c) Breakthroughs at the B26 Polymetallic Deposit (Drilling Highlights & Results Breakdown),"A recent update from Abitibi Metals Corp. (Ticker: AMQ.c or AMQFF for US investors) showcases significant progress made during its initial drilling campaign at the B26 Polymetallic Deposit in Quebec, Canada.

*Highlights:*

Early findings from the first four drill holes are encouraging, particularly drill hole 1274-24-294, which revealed substantial intersections. Notably, it uncovered 61.3 meters at 2.5% Cu equivalent (CuEq), with a significant 10.6 meters at 11.4% CuEq. These results suggest the presence of high-grade core zones encircled by lower-grade halos, indicating promising bulk tonnage potential at the B26 Deposit.

*Surface Prospects:*

Discovery of low-grade near-surface targets across the drilled holes enhances the open-pit potential of the B26 Deposit. Abitibi Metals is committed to fully exploring the mineralization potential, with a total of 8,839 meters drilled across 29 holes thus far

*CEO's Insights:*

Jonathan Deluce, CEO of Abitibi Metals, expressed satisfaction with the initial results, emphasizing their strategic significance. He highlighted the potential profitability of leveraging the lower-grade material, especially in a favorable copper pricing environment, which enhances the value proposition of the B26 Deposit.

*Drilling Strategy:*

The Company intends to expand its drilling campaign to explore the down-dip and along-strike potential, as evidenced by the decision to incorporate three additional holes to investigate the high-grade core identified in drill hole 1274-24-294.

*Long-Term Vision:*

Through this exploration initiative, Abitibi Metals seeks to strengthen its foothold in Quebec's mineral exploration and development sector. The Company's strategic portfolio, including the option to earn 80% of the B26 Polymetallic Deposit and the Beschefer Gold Project, underscores its dedication to acquiring and developing high-quality base and precious metal properties with substantial growth potential.

The favorable progress of the drill program aligns with Abitibi Metals' overarching vision, demonstrating its commitment to unlocking the full potential of the B26 Polymetallic Deposit and contributing to Quebec's mineral exploration landscape.

Have a glance at the chart we’ve shared and let's discuss. From a bullish angle, I'm convinced we're about to bounce off this trend line heading for the higher demand zones (spot the upper two rectangles). The EMAs maintain a bullish cross (see the green line), suggesting momentum's on our side.

1002,"Bulls Defend Support… SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

With the end of day run up yesterday and the 9th support bounce off the daily 20ema on ES I was fairly bullish going into today. I was a bit surprised when I woke up this morning to see the markets red though. However, the bulls ended up getting it together and pushing the market back up for a nice support bounce. With JPOW done speaking and the daily double bottom off support bulls have an opportunity to squeeze bears even higher tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Major data for tomorrow is challenge jobs cuts and unemployment claims but the heavy hitting data comes Friday when we get the unemployment rate.

We did not see new demands today despite the bigger bounce. We once again held daily 20ema support but the bulls did not have enough strength to breakout and close over the daily 8ema resistance today. With 518.76 demand still holding as support now after being retaken yesterday I look to that as support. We continue to weaken sellers but have not seen buyers come back in on the daily yet. 

Bulls will need to close over the daily 8ema resistance tomorrow and will target a move back to 523.45 supply. 

Bears have to hold daily 8ema resistance and close under the daily 20ema support of 516.69 to be in control.

Despite the sellers on SPY weakening today we actually saw our sellers increase in strength on ES. Much like SPY we did not see a new daily demand though. With the daily doji double bottom bounce off the daily 20ema support we remain in a bull trend. This ultimately should be support and should lead to a breakout back to 5309 supply. Bulls have turned 5261 into a strong support area. Bears continuing to reject previous demand/ support of 5272 could be a slight concern for bulls tomorrow. 

Bulls need to retake and close over daily 8ema resistance of 5274 to then target 5309.

Bears have a very small opportunity to double top and take this back down to 20ema support near 5234. However, until we CLOSE under that they are not in control.

Now over on QQQ and NQ we barely thanks to the power hour flush did not get new daily demands.  The daily sellers did weaken once again though. 

Due to the odd gap down we had and then strong bullish day we actually have a bullish engulfing candle today and retaking of the daily 20ema resistance we should once again be looking for an upside breakout tomorrow. The most bearish thing from today is that we came up to and hard rejected 443.94 demand which was the previous support before this breakdown. 

Bulls need to close back over the daily 8ema resistance of 443 tomorrow to then target a move back to double supply of 444.95-446.44.

Bears could make a rejection off the daily 8ema turn into a backtest of the new demand at 440.01.

This daily double bottom off the daily 20ema support is very bullish and generally speaking I look to this to be our bottom for the next run up. I would have liked to seen daily sellers weaken today but I do expect we get a new daily demand tomorrow and that they will weaken over night. Briefly throughout the day we did see them weaken. 

The bulls do need to break through the daily ema resistance and close over 18430 to be back in control and from there a more major breakout and closure over 18582 supply opens up the larger breakout into EOM. 

Bears could double top reject the daily 8ema resistance. I would generally need to see a closure under 18300 minimally in order to be bearish down to 18053-18072 area.

I mentioned yesterday that I was generally bearish on the VIX and bullish on markets based on that long wicked rejection. I was definitely surprised to see the VIX open up 3%+ this morning but in the end they crushed the VIX which led to the breakout. 14.75 supply once again is clear resistance.

With this VIX Rejection we look for a drop back to the daily 8, 20 and 50ema support at 13.77 area tomorrow which will put in a new higher supply and make the 15-15.85 a triple supply/ resistance area. Generally downside is likely limited in markets until we see the VIX breakout over 15.85 and hold.

I have been watching yields and more specifically the dollar closely waiting for a sign that we are seeing a top in them and a bottom in markets. With this back to back doji rejections and bearish engulfing candle on the 10YR today I am looking for the 10yr to start dropping again. 

We should see a new supply tomorrow which will take out 4.341-4.353 supplies and put a new one near 4.383%. The 10YR likely will target a move back to 4.206% demand area.

The one thing I have been watching the closest is the dollar. I mentioned the last two weeks I felt like despite the strong moves we have seen with ES that NQ was being held down by the strength of the dollar. 

The dollar has officially broken its month long uptrend today. With the uptrend being broken this could certainly give a much needed boost to tech to help break it out of its current slump and range based trading. 

104.227-104.415 is critical double demand/ support area. IF we lose that then the next DXY target is 103.384. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.972

As I mentioned I was fairly bullish going into today and I honestly was a bit surprised seeing how far we retraced overnight. Pre market and opening 30minutes I was looking at that as ultimately being support before we pushed higher. We of course had 945 and 10am PMI data which I refuse to play around. I missed pretty much the greatest opportunity of the day as we pumped aggressively on PMI at 10am and then from there we petered out. I was able to find a quick scalp off support and honestly outside of that I just couldn’t find a single trade for the life of me. 

Since I lost my 30k static last night and apparently MFFU has their all in $70 special still I opened an account and went long at open and was able to pass that eval today to make up for my loss 30k static. 

Overall today was extremely boring and was much of the normal we are seeing… tons of overnight range… major move opening hour… chop into power hour. Brutal trading lately honestly.

1003,Introducing PRIZ and its Precious Metals & Copper Exploration Achievements,"With a market capitalization still below C$10 million, Prismo Metals Inc. (Ticker: PRIZ.c or PMOMF for US investors) has a trio of projects poised to build value in the precious metal and copper sectors. At the helm of this endeavor stands PRIZ's Palos Verdes Project where meticulous drilling and strategic partnerships herald significant findings. Meanwhile, PRIZ strives to tap into the potential of copper-gold mineralization amidst historical drilling triumphs at its Hot Breccia Project while PRIZ's Los Pavitos Project also shows indications of valuable mineral deposits.

**Palos Verdes: Unearthing Precious Metals**

In the heart of the Panuco District lies Palos Verdes, a project that epitomizes PRIZ's commitment to thorough exploration. With 6,000 meters drilled and full permitting in place, Palos Verdes has emerged as a focal point for significant findings. Drill hole PV-23-25, for instance, unveiled 102 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold and 3,100 g/t of silver over 0.5 meters, translating to an impressive 11,520 g/t silver equivalent. These results underscore the project's substantial value proposition, particularly with strategic collaboration with Vizsla Silver.

**Hot Breccia: Tapping into Copper-Gold Potential**

Situated in proximity to past-producing mines, PRIZ's Hot Breccia Project has seen historical drilling uncovering significant copper-gold mineralization. Notable intercepts include instances of hydrothermal alteration and copper intercepts exceeding 1%. The project's strategic location and historical data paint a compelling picture of its exploration prospects.

**Los Pavitos: Promising Reconnaissance Data**

Los Pavitos is a project encompassing one concession covering 5,289 hectares. The concession surrounds several smaller concessions that cover a portion of numerous small historic workings, suggesting the potential for significant mineralization. Reconnaissance work conducted at Los Pavitos has shown metal values which indicate the presence of valuable mineral deposits. 

**Leadership and Structure: Pillars of Progress**

PRIZ's progress is reinforced by a solid share structure and a seasoned leadership team. The company's leaders and executives bring invaluable expertise to the table, ensuring effective exploration strategies and optimal resource allocation. With low overheads and a tight share structure, PRIZ maximizes its exploration efforts, striving to deliver tangible results to investors.

With over 6,000 meters drilled at Palos Verdes and encouraging historical results at Hot Breccia & Los Pavitos, PRIZ remains positioned to deliver returns in the dynamic exploration sector. Through continual exploration efforts and strategic partnerships, PRIZ navigates the intricacies of mineral exploration with precision and purpose.

1007,Deep dive and update on the $RILY situation I just like the stock 🚀 DD,"Reposting a DD from NoTime3603 from WSB. It got hundreds of views/comments last night. Then WSB mods killed it.  All content below from NoTime3603. 

\---------------

I just like the stock 🚀

Right, after reading a tonne of posts, including a [17k YOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt4h5p/rily_b_riley_financial_17k_calls_yolo/) on $RILY I put my ape brain to work on a very deep dive.

OP’s DD was terrible, but he was right – I think this is the biggest trading opportunity of the year.

# Overview

* Deeply undervalued ($22 vs $80 fair value)
* Late SEC filing due before 29th April -> major catalyst for swift upwards move
* Negative sentiment is WRONG (see below)
* 230% short interest (freely traded shares, 74% of outstanding)
* CEO is angry at sellers and has $240 million of cash for potential buybacks
* Insider purchases 300% higher than sales
* Rapidly increasing [support among retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/RILYStock/)

# Negative sentiment is overblown

The [negative sentiment around B Riley Financial](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/b-riley-allegedly-hid-ex-franchise-group-ceos-pre-buyout-fraud) is explained as 'knowledge of or involvement in fraudulent dealings'. That being said, I have not found a single shred of evidence anywhere, yet somehow there are some very vocal negative sellers of the stock on twitter.

A [full internal audit](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-board-of-directors-issues-statement-regarding-internal-review-302068456.html) of B Riley Financial by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP found no liability nor evidence of wrongdoing.

This is the full extent to which the company will be investigated as things stand. Unless a world-leading auditor and legal firm has messed up big time, then B Riley Financial is innocent.

With some digging around, I managed to unravel the 'network' linking B Riley Financial to the fraud case. The link is that B Riley financed and invested alongside an individual called Brian Kahn:

* From 2021 to 2023, Riley purchased $925 million of receivables from Kahn. This has all since been received in cash, hence zero liability.
* Riley invested circa $200million dollars into Kahn’s company Franchise Group (FRG) in May 2023 during a takeout deal. Pre-takeout public filings from less than 10 months ago show FRG to have a very [strong holdings and balance sheet](https://fintel.io/bs/us/frg). FRG is not under scrutiny for any wrongdoings and had positive net assets of $400million before the takeout deal 9 months ago.

Brian Kahn worked at a company called ‘Prophecy’, which was recently [charged with incorrect management of investor funds](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/prophecy-fund-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-401-million-fraud). However, Brian Kahn has not been charged with anything. It is the CEO of Prophecy, John Hughes who is being charged. Additionally, this fraud took place between 2015 to 2020, long before Riley Financial became involved with Kahn through their takeout deal of Franchise Group. The worst case scenario is that Kahn has to pay a [$70 million dollar kickback](https://www.investmentnews.com/broker-dealers/news/b-riley-client-misses-payment-to-investors-in-collapsed-fund-250027).

Therefore, B Riley Financial is distinct from the alleged fraud by 4 degrees of separation:

Riley Financial -> FRG -> Brian Kahn -> Prophecy -> John Hughes (guilty)

# Greedy short sellers overleveraged

As mentioned 240% of the openly traded shares are being sold, or 12.4 million out of 5 million (240%). Furthermore, more than half of these were opened below the $25 mark. A push to $30 would trigger a rapidly accelerating upward move as funds are forced to buy shares to hedge losses.

**Marc Cohodes** has been straining to drive this thing into the ground, bombarding the stock relentlessly on Twitter with his buddies. It is clear that he is abusing his reputation as a legendary shark seller to try to create a selffulfilling prophecy. It is funny watching him get triggered by people talking about the stock on Reddit.

B. Riley has [addressed the predatory behavior](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2024-02-22-B-Riley-Financial-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Internal-Review) head on in a press release, condemning their tactics as an unethical attempt to destroy the business.

Another bear Jonathan Weil (follows **Marc Cohodes** on twitter\*\*)\*\* used to work at Kinikos Associates - notorious short-selling hedge fund – and wrote a WSJ article covering the story.

# Addressing the SEC filing

Sharks have jumped on the idea that Riley Financial has missed their 10-K filing, which the company addressed openly to the SEC. There are a few problems with the negative theory. Firstly, if we read the details of the SEC report we can see that the reason for this was simply the excess use of time and resources during the 9-week audit, which cleared with no findings of wrongdoing.

Additionally, Riley filed showing healthy financials. It is highly unusual for fraudulent companies to present false reports during mismanagement cases instead of waiting it out. This would be a criminal offence and carry additional charges of fraud and misleading investors. it is very likely that these early reports are accurate.

Riley Financial's major debtor – Nomura – gave them a pass on the delayed filing and approved their dividend offering. It is VERY unlikely that Nomura (which has a backdoor to the companies books) would accept a dividend payment to be given if it was concerned about a default. This is a HUGE indicator that Riley Financial’s accounts are healthy and the delayed filing is simply an administrative problem.

**B Riley Financial** has until the 29th April to submit their delayed filing, but could file any time before then. My theses is that once the SEC is in receipt of an confirms their filing, the stock price will reset to fair value very quickly.

# What are the people with the most information doing?

As mentioned previously, Nomura (Riley’s bank) allowed a dividend and signed off on an extension to their audit filing, indicating that they are confident in the financials.

**Sullivan & Cromwell LLP** audited Riley and came back with no concerns. This is a highly prestigious law firm.

**Strong insider trading**. In fact, over the past year 280% more shares have been purchased than sold by insiders (590’000 buys vs 165’000 sells). The last sale was nearly 5 months ago. The last 3 months of insider trading are even more promising. Since the stock has started to tank, insiders have purchased 1500% more shares than they have sold.

I'm not going to run a DD on their financials, as that is not what this post is about. I'm sure some of you regards can figure out how to do that.

# Target price and positions

The fair price is around $60, 200% above current levels. A ramp in buying to hedge positions could cause a run up above $200.

My positions are:

* $RILY 800 shares at 22.30 average
* $RILY 200 x Apr'12 25Call
* $RILY 100 x May'3 35Call

1010,Watchlist for some KULR Alts,"Hello everyone! Wishing you a fantastic week ahead! This post is a brief rundown of some promising alternatives to $KULR, which I believe could see a notable price increase in the coming days. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

**First up, ARLSF**:

I’ve been keeping an eye on $ARLSF (as you might have noticed from my previous posts) because since February 13th, 2024, its average daily volume has skyrocketed from hundreds to over 100,000. Plus, it’s shown some impressive intraday jumps. Below is a chart with potential price targets. I'm convinced ARLSF could be the next big thing, similar to KULR.

https://preview.redd.it/lxmut2xjrgsc1.png?width=3161&format=png&auto=webp&s=019b32a01b17fd70d32d7708d9a32c5160c06b59

**Then, of course, there’s KULR**:

I know, I know – you’re here for alternatives. Yet, I believe KULR’s journey is far from over. My targets see it potentially reaching up to $8.90/share, equating to a $1B market cap. If KULR’s vision resonates with you, it might still be a good time to consider.

**Finally, VTGN**:

The chart for VTGN is looking incredibly promising. While this pick is mainly based on technical analysis right now (I’m planning to dive deeper), expect to hear more from me on this one soon!

https://preview.redd.it/nh2mpvwkrgsc1.png?width=3161&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e5c0e2a5599f9840b48c11173079c3d7868a33

To wrap up, the quest for the ""next big thing"" is perpetual in the penny stock arena. While it’s exciting to chase the potential highs, focus on investments that align with your beliefs and where you see genuine potential. Of course, a bit of risk-taking is part of the thrill here!

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, BioPipe India Private Limited, the Company is concurrently pursuing both industrial (ETP) and sewage wastewater treatment (STP) markets.

Prathamesh Jadhav, the COO of BioPipe India Private Limited, stated that “BioPipe has secured an order from a hospital. The Hospital has acquired a large parcel of land where they will be building a new Hospital along with a future Medical College. The development of the Hospital is in 3 phases. Each phase will have a 30m3/day BioPipe decentralized sewage wastewater treatment system. We have started procurement for the first plant. India is beginning to adopt decentralized sewage treatment systems and over the last 3 years we have been working to establish a foothold in the decentralized wastewater treatment market for hospitals. BioPipe stands out against competition in terms of space and energy savings, no odor, no sludge and the quality of treated wastewater. The small footprint of the Biopipe STP allowed the hospital to free up space to accommodate other utility systems in the allotted area.”

Enes Kutluca, the CEO of BioPipe Global Corp, stated that “it has been observed that the intrinsic toxicity of hospital effluents could be 5 to 15 times more than an urban effluent. Hospital sewage/wastewater can contaminate surface and groundwater with a variety of potentially harmful substances, posing significant risks to people and the environment. Hospital sewage wastewater treatment is therefore essential. BioPipe systems is the best suited sewage treatment plant for hospitals in urban settings where onsite treatment is the only option.”

**About LifeQuest & BioPipe**

LifeQuest offers effluent treatment plants (ETP), sewage treatment plants (STP), fat oil and grease (FOG) separator and hybrid media for water polishing. BioPipe has developed a patented, 100% sludge-free, chemical-free, odor-free, silent, easy to assemble and install, scalable, low cost, ecological and low maintenance-free onsite sewage wastewater treatment system.

1018,"Fed Speakers Dump The Market… 4-4-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

I want to start my post today by saying this… today is the EXCEPT not the RULE to trading… if you go into every day expecting a move as large and aggressive as this… you are going to have a really bad time… most likely this happen every once in a blue moon… don’t expect the same thing tomorrow. 

Bulls were having themselves a very nice little day and I was thinking we might just see ATHs if not minimally close over critical daily range resistance… however, of course the fed decided to mess with those plans.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sl3rnff1sisc1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=10cc4ef3b0b817b13a44ad00f6280a7f087f722c

We had two fed speakers say that there is a chance we might not see rate cuts at all this year… which honestly I have been saying since December 2023 there was a really good chance inflation has not been conquered and that we will see no rate cuts in 2024… looks like the fed is starting to favor that play too… This sent the VIX on a massive LOD to HOD reversal in about an hour. With oil at the highest levels since early October and projected Cleveland fed CPI YoY to rise by 0.2%... there really is no base case where we get a rate cut until at least 2025 honestly… 

The question will now be… is this the dip buying opportunity or do we finally have a reason to be bearish and will things finally be different and we break the daily 20ema support on ES? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8zns5x1sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=95400739bad8a9f2fee16fd9d9d146e6baed9a27

In my opinion the market has never been on edge as much as it has going into UE tomorrow… IF UE comes in lower than 3.9% which would indicate that the economy is strong and inflation is likely to keep going up we could easily see a major dump on markets… If UE comes in 4% or higher and this indicates a weakening economy I think this whole intraday dump will be reversed and we easily will squeeze throughout the day. This gonna be one incredibly important data to watch. 

As funny as it is that I said I was only bullish and didn’t see a reason to be bearish… we get a day like this… now the one thing I will say to anyone thinking “this is it.” How many times have we had a day or moment like this where we think this is finally the hump that breaks the camels back… yet markets shake it off the next day? I am generally bullish here and I would be surprised if two fed speakers would be the black swan catalyst that starts a correction in this market… not saying it doesn’t happen just saying it would be incredibly unexpected. 

Truly the biggest things that makes me go “huh” here is that markets shook off back to back CPI and PCE readings that were hot and believed JPOW when he said that we shouldn’t care about a little bump in the road… yet two random fed speakers say we MIGHT not cut in 2024 and the markets go straight full on capitulation. I don’t know it just seems a bit odd to me. Doesn’t really make sense to be the reaction we got today. This reaction today would suggest that random fed speakers mean more and hold more weight than actual cold hard data (like CPI).

If you remember this chart I have shown time and time again… it would appear this time is different indeed… 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4me2ixm2sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b01b6c46285af3b73f613723dedee242aae63d58

Up until when we had that major flash crash on the markets we honestly were set up for one heck of a bullish move and breakout. However, when we look at this daily candle on SPY this has got to be one of the most nasty and bearish candles I have ever seen. Nearly a $11.25 drop intraday is truly impressive. 

From a bearish stand point here we rejected 523.45 supply and completely bearish engulfed the last 9 trading days. We also closed under the daily 20ema support for the first time since January 4th 2024. Bears also broke this back under previous demand/ support of 518.76. 

Bulls have to retake daily 20ema resistance at 516.54 and ideally close back over daily 8ema resistance of 519 tomorrow to be back in control. 

Bears now have stronger daily sellers and a major break in trend here. The bears took us down to first demand/ support of 512.78 which is where we bounce. From here we have a three more critical levels of 508.05-510.37 to break through. IF we can get through those then daily 50ema target near 505.55 is my target. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 523.45  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37 -> 512.78 -> 518.76

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n6bnbd03sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c019c16488fc48b86183c07a36bec4eaaeea518e

Now looking at ES here we also have a major rejection off the previous supply of 5309 and stronger daily sellers. With no new daily demand and a closure under daily 8/20ema support and previous demand/ support of 5272 this is a very bearish candle here. 

Bulls need to retake 5233 the daily 20ema resistance minimally tomorrow to be back in control. 

Bears have an opportunity to take this market back down to the daily demand at 5185 and eye the daily 50ema support near 5114 into next week. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5309  
 Demand- 5185 -> 5272

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4puo5hc3sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d233e1ba1c64df09680bde1df9a540b387bf623b

To go along with the incredible rejection and bearish engulfing candle on SPY we also have an impressive nearly $11.75 drop on QQQ today. With an impressive almost to the penny rejection off 446.44 supply, we once again are confirming that 444.95-446.44 is ultimately strong resistance here. 

With stronger daily sellers and a potential for a bearish cross under of the 8 and 20ema… we are looking at the potential temporary top here…

Bulls have got to defend this support area here and minimally retake the daily 8 and 20ema resistance of 441- 441.9 tomorrow. 

Bears once again have an opportunity to take this market lower and to see the daily 50ema support near 433.84 demand. 

QQQ DAILY LEVLELS  
 Supply- 444.95 -> 446.44  
 Demand- 433.84 -> 443.94

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/bb606mp3sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a21bda3119cbc1e8d1ca8ac5469cc5dd50b9fde

Nq ended up sneaking in a new demand at the close of the candle on the daily yesterday at 18342. With this major rejection once again off the 18582 area and closure back under 18342 demand/ support we were able to put a new supply in at 18386. With stronger daily sellers and this incredible rejection here we are looking at an opportunity to go lower here. 

Bulls have got to minimally retake 18342-18386 tomorrow to be back in control. 

Bears could seek out a move back to the daily 50ema support. This 17857-18072 is a major support area that bulls have to defend. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18386 -> 18582  
 Demand- 17857 -> 17980 -> 18053 -> 18072

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iqhgy924sisc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e56208431c52bca91ebf98b20877bea2a6dae0e0

Of all the charts I have got to say that the VIX is the most impressive. With this massive sell off the VIX saw an incredibly impressive 19% LOD to HOD rally. We appear to be breaking out of this major 12.08-15.84 range. 

I had mentioned yesterday that unless we broke through 15.54-15.84 double supply and resistance I did not see much downside. The bears finally got their breakout over that level. This is now the highest close on the VIX since 11/1/23 when the VIX closed at 16.87. 

I am actually a bit surprised that they did not crush the VIX into EOD here but I will be having all eyes on the vix tomorrow. 

As I have said time and time again… markets need 1. A reason to initially sell (today that was the fed speakers) and 2. They more importantly need a reason to continue to sell…. The question is overnight and into tomorrow do they have a reason to continue to sell? The UE rate at 830am certainly could be the catalyst to continue to sell off but if that UE rate comes in higher than previous I don’t see a reason for the markets to continue to sell off. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5kjvrh4sisc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f2967eb66b0cf4bb8310570708090c3884fab3

I woke up this morning with a near 101\* fever and really considered taking the whole day off from trading but decided to stick it out. I ended up taking one long where I thought we had found support only for us to drop. I did get half of my loss back on another long into the HOD push before the major drop. I need to be better about my stop loss as I once again set it too tight which caused me to get stopped out at 10pts and miss the bigger 60pt move. Granted I had saw a big double top rejection and didn’t wanna close red… but I need to do better about letting plays run. 

My other funded 50k account I took a quick 5pt long scalp on ES and that was about it. 

All in all… a green day overall and not too bad considering I felt like crud all day long and could for the most part barely keep my eyes open. Hoping for a good day of trading tomorrow to round the green week off.

1020,Unveiling EV Minerals' Breakthroughs and Growth Potential at its EV Nickel Project,"EV Minerals Corporation (Ticker: EVM.c) have yielded significant findings at the EV Nickel Project in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region.

EV Minerals recently shared significant findings from its exploration endeavors at the EV Nickel Project located in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Region. Extensive data analysis has revealed promising zones within the project, indicating substantial potential for resource expansion and development.

The EV Nickel Project spans 1,792 hectares and hosts an undeveloped NI 43-101 non-compliant resource estimated at 5.585 million tonnes, with grades of 0.21% Ni.

Through meticulous examination of historical drilling data and regional geology, EV Minerals pinpointed compelling drill targets in the South and East Zones. 

Noteworthy discoveries include high-grade mineralization of nickel within formations at the South Zone. 

Similarly, exploration in the Eastern Anomaly has uncovered wide disseminated sulphides, suggesting significant mineralization potential.

In the North Zone, promising drill targets have been determined through comprehensive desktop compilation which have uncovered notable intersections showcasing wide zones with elevated and nickel grades and high-grade nickel pockets.

With mineralization concentrated near the surface and opportunities for expansion along strike and at depth, the project holds considerable promise for future development. EV Minerals plans to utilize digitized historic exploration data to inform future drill programs and enhance resource updates, thereby advancing the project's development prospects.

I just like the stock 🚀

Right, after reading a tonne of posts, including a [17k YOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bt4h5p/rily_b_riley_financial_17k_calls_yolo/) on $RILY I put my ape brain to work on a very deep dive.

OP’s DD was terrible, but he was right – I think this is the biggest trading opportunity of the year.

# Overview

* Deeply undervalued ($22 vs $80 fair value)
* Late SEC filing due before 29th April -> major catalyst for swift upwards move
* Negative sentiment is WRONG (see below)
* 230% short interest (freely traded shares, 74% of outstanding)
* CEO is angry at sellers and has $240 million of cash for potential buybacks
* Insider purchases 300% higher than sales
* Rapidly increasing [support among retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/RILYStock/)

# Negative sentiment is overblown

The [negative sentiment around B Riley Financial](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/b-riley-allegedly-hid-ex-franchise-group-ceos-pre-buyout-fraud) is explained as 'knowledge of or involvement in fraudulent dealings'. That being said, I have not found a single shred of evidence anywhere, yet somehow there are some very vocal negative sellers of the stock on twitter.

A [full internal audit](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-board-of-directors-issues-statement-regarding-internal-review-302068456.html) of B Riley Financial by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP found no liability nor evidence of wrongdoing.

This is the full extent to which the company will be investigated as things stand. Unless a world-leading auditor and legal firm has messed up big time, then B Riley Financial is innocent.

With some digging around, I managed to unravel the 'network' linking B Riley Financial to the fraud case. The link is that B Riley financed and invested alongside an individual called Brian Kahn:

* From 2021 to 2023, Riley purchased $925 million of receivables from Kahn. This has all since been received in cash, hence zero liability.
* Riley invested circa $200million dollars into Kahn’s company Franchise Group (FRG) in May 2023 during a takeout deal. Pre-takeout public filings from less than 10 months ago show FRG to have a very [strong holdings and balance sheet](https://fintel.io/bs/us/frg). FRG is not under scrutiny for any wrongdoings and had positive net assets of $400million before the takeout deal 9 months ago.

Brian Kahn worked at a company called ‘Prophecy’, which was recently [charged with incorrect management of investor funds](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/prophecy-fund-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-401-million-fraud). However, Brian Kahn has not been charged with anything. It is the CEO of Prophecy, John Hughes who is being charged. Additionally, this fraud took place between 2015 to 2020, long before Riley Financial became involved with Kahn through their takeout deal of Franchise Group. The worst case scenario is that Kahn has to pay a [$70 million dollar kickback](https://www.investmentnews.com/broker-dealers/news/b-riley-client-misses-payment-to-investors-in-collapsed-fund-250027).

Therefore, B Riley Financial is distinct from the alleged fraud by 4 degrees of separation:

Riley Financial -> FRG -> Brian Kahn -> Prophecy -> John Hughes (guilty)

# Greedy short sellers overleveraged

As mentioned 240% of the openly traded shares are being sold, or 12.4 million out of 5 million (240%). Furthermore, more than half of these were opened below the $25 mark. A push to $30 would trigger a rapidly accelerating upward move as funds are forced to buy shares to hedge losses.

**Marc Cohodes** has been straining to drive this thing into the ground, bombarding the stock relentlessly on Twitter with his buddies. It is clear that he is abusing his reputation as a legendary shark seller to try to create a selffulfilling prophecy. It is funny watching him get triggered by people talking about the stock on Reddit.

B. Riley has [addressed the predatory behavior](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2024-02-22-B-Riley-Financial-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Internal-Review) head on in a press release, condemning their tactics as an unethical attempt to destroy the business.

Another bear Jonathan Weil (follows **Marc Cohodes** on twitter\*\*)\*\* used to work at Kinikos Associates - notorious short-selling hedge fund – and wrote a WSJ article covering the story.

OP’s DD was terrible, but he was right – I think this is the biggest trading opportunity of the year.

# Overview

* Deeply undervalued ($22 vs $80 fair value)
* Late SEC filing due before 29th April -> major catalyst for swift upwards move
* Negative sentiment is WRONG (see below)
* 230% short interest (freely traded shares, 74% of outstanding)
* CEO is angry at sellers and has $240 million of cash for potential buybacks
* Insider purchases 300% higher than sales
* Rapidly increasing [support among retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/RILYStock/)

# Negative sentiment is overblown

The [negative sentiment around B Riley Financial](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/b-riley-allegedly-hid-ex-franchise-group-ceos-pre-buyout-fraud) is explained as 'knowledge of or involvement in fraudulent dealings'. That being said, I have not found a single shred of evidence anywhere, yet somehow there are some very vocal negative sellers of the stock on twitter.

A [full internal audit](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-board-of-directors-issues-statement-regarding-internal-review-302068456.html) of B Riley Financial by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP found no liability nor evidence of wrongdoing.

This is the full extent to which the company will be investigated as things stand. Unless a world-leading auditor and legal firm has messed up big time, then B Riley Financial is innocent.

With some digging around, I managed to unravel the 'network' linking B Riley Financial to the fraud case. The link is that B Riley financed and invested alongside an individual called Brian Kahn:

* From 2021 to 2023, Riley purchased $925 million of receivables from Kahn. This has all since been received in cash, hence zero liability.
* Riley invested circa $200million dollars into Kahn’s company Franchise Group (FRG) in May 2023 during a takeout deal. Pre-takeout public filings from less than 10 months ago show FRG to have a very [strong holdings and balance sheet](https://fintel.io/bs/us/frg). FRG is not under scrutiny for any wrongdoings and had positive net assets of $400million before the takeout deal 9 months ago.

Brian Kahn worked at a company called ‘Prophecy’, which was recently [charged with incorrect management of investor funds](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/prophecy-fund-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-401-million-fraud). However, Brian Kahn has not been charged with anything. It is the CEO of Prophecy, John Hughes who is being charged. Additionally, this fraud took place between 2015 to 2020, long before Riley Financial became involved with Kahn through their takeout deal of Franchise Group. The worst case scenario is that Kahn has to pay a [$70 million dollar kickback](https://www.investmentnews.com/broker-dealers/news/b-riley-client-misses-payment-to-investors-in-collapsed-fund-250027).

Therefore, B Riley Financial is distinct from the alleged fraud by 4 degrees of separation:

Riley Financial -> FRG -> Brian Kahn -> Prophecy -> John Hughes (guilty)

# Greedy short sellers overleveraged

As mentioned 240% of the openly traded shares are being sold, or 12.4 million out of 5 million (240%). Furthermore, more than half of these were opened below the $25 mark. A push to $30 would trigger a rapidly accelerating upward move as funds are forced to buy shares to hedge losses.

**Marc Cohodes** has been straining to drive this thing into the ground, bombarding the stock relentlessly on Twitter with his buddies. It is clear that he is abusing his reputation as a legendary shark seller to try to create a selffulfilling prophecy. It is funny watching him get triggered by people talking about the stock on Reddit.

B. Riley has [addressed the predatory behavior](https://ir.brileyfin.com/2024-02-22-B-Riley-Financial-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Internal-Review) head on in a press release, condemning their tactics as an unethical attempt to destroy the business.

Another bear Jonathan Weil (follows **Marc Cohodes** on twitter\*\*)\*\* used to work at Kinikos Associates - notorious short-selling hedge fund – and wrote a WSJ article covering the story.

# Addressing the SEC filing

Sharks have jumped on the idea that Riley Financial has missed their 10-K filing, which the company addressed openly to the SEC. There are a few problems with the negative theory. Firstly, if we read the details of the SEC report we can see that the reason for this was simply the excess use of time and resources during the 9-week audit, which cleared with no findings of wrongdoing.

Additionally, Riley filed showing healthy financials. It is highly unusual for fraudulent companies to present false reports during mismanagement cases instead of waiting it out. This would be a criminal offence and carry additional charges of fraud and misleading investors. it is very likely that these early reports are accurate.

Riley Financial's major debtor – Nomura – gave them a pass on the delayed filing and approved their dividend offering. It is VERY unlikely that Nomura (which has a backdoor to the companies books) would accept a dividend payment to be given if it was concerned about a default. This is a HUGE indicator that Riley Financial’s accounts are healthy and the delayed filing is simply an administrative problem.

**B Riley Financial** has until the 29th April to submit their delayed filing, but could file any time before then. My theses is that once the SEC is in receipt of an confirms their filing, the stock price will reset to fair value very quickly.

# What are the people with the most information doing?

As mentioned previously, Nomura (Riley’s bank) allowed a dividend and signed off on an extension to their audit filing, indicating that they are confident in the financials.

**Sullivan & Cromwell LLP** audited Riley and came back with no concerns. This is a highly prestigious law firm.

**Strong insider trading**. In fact, over the past year 280% more shares have been purchased than sold by insiders (590’000 buys vs 165’000 sells). The last sale was nearly 5 months ago. The last 3 months of insider trading are even more promising. Since the stock has started to tank, insiders have purchased 1500% more shares than they have sold.

I'm not going to run a DD on their financials, as that is not what this post is about. I'm sure some of you regards can figure out how to do that.

# Target price and positions

The fair price is around $60, 200% above current levels. A ramp in buying to hedge positions could cause a run up above $200.

My positions are:

* $RILY 800 shares at 22.30 average
* $RILY 200 x Apr'12 25Call
* $RILY 100 x May'3 35Call

&#x200B;

RONN Inc. (OTC PINK:RONN), a pioneering technology company focused on providing sustainable transportation and fuel alternatives, proudly announced a transformative step towards carbon neutrality through an exclusive strategic agreement with NetZero, LLC. Under this agreement, Net Zero will undertake the registration, pre-sale and monetization of environmental credits on behalf of RONN. This emerging market has an impressive potential long-term cash value should these credits follow the same trajectory of the existing environmental credit market forelectric vehicles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

NASDAQ has announced their Marketplace Services Platform for Voluntary Carbon Markets and Registries where these future Hydrogen Environmental Credits will most likely trade using NASDAQ's Services Platform. Based upon the previous volume of Carbon Credits for battery EVs, experts project Hydrogen Credits will provide billions of dollars of capital into companies such as RONN in order to further advance the de-carbonization agenda. According to Shell, Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg, in 2023 alone it is expected to be $1.7B - $2.0B for Voluntary Markets expanding to a projected $250 billion by 2050, with pricing per unit expanding from $.17 to upwards of $50 during the same period.

&#x200B;

""We are thrilled to sign an exclusive agreement with RONN,"" said Bill Weathersby, Chairman of Net Zero. ""In this agreement, Net Zero will be responsible for working with several parties to establish a new hydrogen methodology in this emerging space as well as marketing and pre-selling all the environmental credits generated by RONN. We will be tapping into our global expertise to maximize the environmental and financial impact of these credits.""

&#x200B;

This landmark partnership will see RONN contributing to the global carbon offset market, specifically targeting the stationary hydrogen production sector through its new Hydrogen Hub sales. The environmental carbon offset credits generated will play a crucial role in supporting RONN's commitment to zero emission vehicle manufacturing and hydrogen production hubs.

&#x200B;

As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, RONN is taking proactive measures to make a substantial impact. By collaborating with Net Zero, a recognized leader in the carbon reduction environmental credit space, RONN aims to leverage its position in both the stationary hydrogen production sector and vehicle manufacturing to create a positive environmental legacy.

Thinking this could be a good play after the restructuring, will stop the losses and help them return to profitable.  Seem they took a hit during the pandemic on sales, but bounced right back. They are cutting 4 percent of staff worldwide which shows they know they had an issue and will be streamlining. 


Also they recently acquired Forcite Helmet Systems, a maker of technology-enabled motorcycle helmets. With an overlap in extreme sports customers. Integrating cameras and HUD displays into the helmet structure. This shows innovation and new markets for them. Additionally they have made micro versions, it and the 12 are water proof now out of the box. 

I feel the stock is undervalued, it's a billion dollar company, global name, the founder/creator still is the CEO, he still runs this company, he could have profited and bailed, but by staying you know it is his baby and he is going to do his best to take care of it. 

I know people thin camera phones will replace these gopro's but I would risk a 300.00 gopro before my phone on risky stuff. Also drones mount them, dash cam users, motorsports of all kinds stick with them, scuba and water sports, marketing videos, list goes on and on, they are still selling a ton. 

Even better is their cloud sync offering, it is 25.00 a month and allows unlimited gopro footage to be stored and 25gb of other files as well, huge for the self youtuber using a gopro. There is a professional offering as well. This adds another revune stream to the company. Granted I know cloud sync isn't new for tech, but the fact they are doing it is great for the company and the users in need in my opinion.


I just like the stock. I like the founder still running his company. I feel like it is at a price where everyone has access to it. I am in no way affiliated with GoPro.

Honestly this job report and likely the CPI report next week that is going to show continued upside is going to confirm the fed likely (outside of a black swan) is not going to cut rates in 2024 at all… honestly there is seriously in my opinion a case by EOY 24 we get a rate HIKE if oil continues on the same trajectory it is now and inflation doesn’t cool off due to strong jobs market. 

The fed backed themselves into a corner the last two FOMC meetings that they are seriously going to regret. We are already seeing the markets starting to not believe the fed. Next week with CPI on Wednesday is going to be extremely spicy. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/govc1dqaypsc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=040501854f20580605a0c7e0ee294453af0bfee2

Monday and Tuesday we don’t have much data.. I would honestly after todays bounce not be surprised to see a fairly sizeable run up into CPI on Wednesday. 

Wednesday we not only have CPI at 830am but we also get 10 year bond auction at 1pm but also FOMC meeting minutes at 2pm… Thursday is PPI and jobless claims again and we round Friday out with UofMich consumer sentiment. A very intense data week Wednesday through Friday is coming for us. 

I will have a report out Tuesday night on my CPI predictions on expectations. The last two CPIs that rebounded higher the market completely shook it off… I am very curious to see if this market can actually shake off a third higher inflation reading or not… if inflation is not back in the 2s very soon the odds of a rate CUT in 2024 is basically going to go to 0%... the markets already moved rate cut expectations full to September from June. If you remember coming into 2024… markets originally expected a rate cut to first come in January… then it was March 100% odds almost… now we are looking at September.

Looking ahead at the CME fedwatch tool versus fed swaps you can see once gain the fedwatch tool still is showing 3 rate cuts as the highest base case… much like CPI though the fed swaps rarely lately have been wrong. If we get a hot CPI next week I would be surprised to see markets keep 3 rate cuts. Likely the first rate cut odds will shift to September 2024 if not November 2024. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fv8e2bgbypsc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f85a36db928643907e4f58e6adcbcad4c345c227

Taking a look at the weekly time frame here we are seeing our first weekly bearish engulfing close since the first week of January. Fully enough that also was the week after quarterly options expiration. 

The weekly 8ema support continues to be defended along with the weekly demand of 509.48. For the last 6 weeks now we have closed between 509.48 demand and 523.21 supply. 

We once again saw a big drop in weekly buying support, however, we continue to remain in extreme bull momentum on the weekly timeframe. We did see our large rising wedge support line broken this week once again. However, we remain in an even large macro bull channel since Octobers low still. 

Bulls are going to need to close a new weekly high over 523.21 and seek a move to the red bigger channel resistance line of 528.95 and eventually the yellow bull channel resistance of 535.7 area. 

Bears need to close below weekly 8ema support and previous demand of 509.48 which could bring a backtest of weekly 20ema support near 497.67 demand. The weekly 20ema support perfectly correlates with the yellow bull channels support line. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS

 Demand- 497.67 -> 509.48

Taking a look at ES futures here we have the same pattern as spy in that we broke weekly rising wedge support but remain in a bigger macro bull channel in yellow. This is back to back weeks of weaker buyers. We have not seen three weeks of weakened buyers since December. 

With this bearish engulfing weekly candle and new supply at 5307 we could be looking at our new top here… 5307-5309 is now a weekly and daily supply/ resistance area to watch. However, bulls have still defended the weekly 8ema support and previous demand of 5183.

Bulls need to continue to defend weekly 8ema support and demand of 5183 and close over 5307 supply to bring a breakout. 

Bears have an opportunity to take us lower, however, they will need to close below the weekly 8ema support and demand of 5183. If they do that their target is the weekly 20ema support of 5014 which is also previous demand. The weekly 20ema support perfectly correlates with the yellow bull channel support too. 

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5142 -> 5307  
 Demand- 5014 -> 5183

Looking at QQQ here we actually see a similar move here on SPY. We broke the white rising wedge support but we are still in a general overall bull channel in yellow riding higher. We have now seen 5 weeks in a row that the buyers on the weekly timeframe have weakened. We also are one red week away from seeing extreme bull momentum broken. 

Since reconfirming 446.38 as supply last week the bulls were not able to retake anything higher and were not able to put in a new demand. Despite not being able to put in a new demand the bulls did hold onto weekly 8ema support and previous demand of 443.61. This weekly supply and resistance of 446.38 perfectly correlates with daily supply and resistance of 444.95-446.44. 

Bulls need to bounce off this weekly 8ema support and demand next week again and retake the supply at 446.38. If the bulls can breakout and bring back in weekly buyers we could be looking at a move to the red bull channel resistance near 462.

Bears have once again an opportunity with this bearish engulfing candle to bring us lower. IF they can break through weekly 8ema support and demand of 433.61 then they face even stronger weekly support/ demand at 423.1-428.26. If the bears close us below 423.1 I would feel very confident that we have found a temporary top and a stronger correction is coming. This triple demand area is likely going to be strong and hard to break. 

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 446.38  
 Demand- 423.1 -> 428.26 -> 433.61 

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

Much like the other NQ is seeing a break of its rising wedge support but continues to defend its bigger yellow bull channel. The interesting thing about Nq is that it is the closest to seeing weekly sellers of all of them. This would be the first time that NQ has seen weekly sellers since October. 

NQ has been ranging from 18054 to 18569 for the last 6 weeks here now. This consolidation likely is going to lead to a major breakout or break down. 

Bulls need to defend the weekly 8ema support and demand of 18054 still. IF they do not see new buyers come in soon we are likely to see a bigger drop down to weekly 20ema support. However, if bulls can bounce support again and close over previous supply/ resistance of 18568 (which correlates with daily supply/ resistance of 18582) we are looking at a breakout to 19000.

Bears need to break through 18054 demand and weekly 8ema support. IF they can do this then their next support and target is the lower double demand/ support of 17460-17718 which correlates with the weekly 20ema support. Weekly sellers would likely be enough to take the market lower. Yellow macro bull channel support sits at 17718 for next week. 

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16957 -> 18569  
 Demand- 17460 -> 17718 -> 18054

I am actually a bit surprised by the VIX today. I am surprised to see the VIX so flat and mostly surprised to see the VIX backtested and hard bounced off the double supply of 15.54-15.85. The VIX almost to the penny bounced off the previous reconfirmed supply/ resistance of 15.54. This is why I TA the VIX… the levels do matter. 

Now the VIX didn’t even threaten a new supply (top) today either which is even more interesting. The VIX is not so subtly on a major breakout and once again is holding. Now we did see a big drop this morning which is what I was expecting as I thought we would see a VIX crush a major green breakout. 

This candle has a tendency to be a reversal and top candle so I could see a crush next week. We will have two trading days before CPI on Wednesday. Next major upside levels to watch is 20.637-21.73 on the VIX. 

IF we continue to see the VIX push up like it is we are likely to see downside in this market. However, if we get the classic VIX crush (which I am again a bit surprised to not see today) then we likely see a major breakout. 

One other thing to keep in mind going into CPI with the VIX this elevated is that we are likely to see a repeat of what happened last month on CPI where even though we got bad data the VIX and volatility was so darn high that it crushed and caused us to rally anyways. So keep that in the back of your mind going into Wednesday.

The 10YR yield continues to be in a major weekly up channel since December. This is really not surprising as the yields are going to stay higher until they know for sure the feds are going to finally cut. Just like I have been saying since December 2023 (which bond market is too) inflation is not under control and we likely are not going to see any rate cuts this year… 

The 10YR broke through its nearly two month long resistance/ supply of 4.305% this week. This puts it on a path to retest 4.628% which is previous support from October 2023.

The dollar is the weekly and daily chart I have been watching the closest. This is because I believe until we see the dollar crush we are not going to see tech regain its strength. There was a little period this week where we saw DXY start to crush which of course brought strength to NQ. 

We did get a new weekly supply and resistance at 104.548 on DXY. DXY also continues to be in an uptrend since December too. 

If we break through 104.548 supply next week our upside target will be 105.591 which likely brings further weakness to tech. 

If we reject and push to previous demand/ support of 102.74 we could be looking at a breakout to ATHs on tech. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.548 -> 105.591  
 Demand- 102.74

**US OIL/ CL FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

*Processing img 9aq0ol3hypsc1...*

The biggest thing hurting the fed right now and of course hurting CPI right now is the fact that oil is on a massive breakout. This is the highest weekly close on oil since middle of October. 

Now if we really zoom out here and look at the last two years of oil it actually had been in a major macro red bear channel. However, this week for the first time in two years OIL has officially broken that bear channel resistance. 

Oil is going to likely make a run at the double supply/ resistance level of 91.22-92.61 from the October 2022 and September 2023 highs. IF we break through and close over that levels then 98.35 and 120.9 are the next major upside levels to watch for. 

If oil can finally find some resistance major support to watch and target is near 80.57-81.02.

US Oil/ CL FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 81.02 -> 91.22 -> 92.61  
 Demand- 80.57

I ended up having a nice little day today. I came into today with a very bullish mindset and my plan was to find the morning dip to go long. I got in at a pretty good level and nabbed a quick 5pts on ES in one funded account, 3 pts in another and then about 50pts on Nq in another funded account. 

I really wanted to let my plays run for a bigger upside win but I was very happy with my wins and how green my accounts were. I didn’t see a reason to be greedy. After that it really was buy the red 15min candle until about 1pm when we started to retrace. I always struggle to trade days like these so I was content with my dad and week. 

This market has a way of punishing those who are greedy and I did not want to be punished today. 

Overall a great week of trading.  ",1712348249,823664,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,bfd0b1fde8a66cf0ab84df886f39e976a29f517ffa4d6bddb32eb27240afc4e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1bwrww1/this_time_indeed_is_not_different_4524_spy_es/

1038,Colorado Governor Says Marijuana Rescheduling And Banking Reform Are First ‘Dominoes’ On Path To Federal Legalization (NASDAQ: INCR),"Colorado’s governor says that while federal marijuana legalization is the ultimate goal, incremental rescheduling and cannabis banking reform are important “dominoes” that could help pave the way. And he said his state continues to have “very strong conversations with the White House” about the need for policy change.

During a keynote speech at a National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) event in Denver on Thursday, Gov. Jared Polis (D) touted Colorado’s leadership in the cannabis legalization movement, adding that “we’ve been making continual progress” in the decade since its market launched.

“Through all of that, of course, we put equity at the center of our work,” he said. “We want to make sure that people who have been at the short end of the drug war for decades are first in line for the kinds of opportunities that come out of a rational, regulated structure.”

In their preliminary 2023 results, InterCure CEO said:  
Facing an unprecedentedly challenging year, InterCure has showcased remarkable resilience and sustained growth, achieving our fifteenth consecutive quarter of profitability. Our continued profit from operations highlights the dedication of our team and the strength of our leading platform. As pharmaceutical cannabis becomes the new global standard, we are encouraged by the FDA’s recent recommendations and the potential rescheduling of Cannabis in the US. Our established leadership, and commitment to global expansion, product portfolio enhancement, and delivering value to our patients and shareholders sets us on a path of continued growth and success.""

This follows recent german reform which is likely to benefit intercure as well. Germany's Cannabis Act represents a tripartite reform that impacts homegrown cannabis, social clubs for recreational use, and, most crucially, medical cannabis. For the medical sector, the reform is groundbreaking. By removing medical cannabis from the narcotics act, Germany is significantly easing and cheapening the prescription process, a move that is expected to expand the market exponentially. in a recently article ""As such, medical cannabis players are positioned to significantly benefit from this shift, assuming they can capitalize on the opportunity. One example of such us, InterCure, the leading medical cannabis company outside North America which known for its operational excellence. The seems s uniquely positioned to capitalize on this legislative shift with its subsidiary, Canndoc, being Israel’s largest licensed cannabis producer and a pioneer in GMP-certified pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis products""

Public information reveals that WiMi  Hologram Cloud(NASDAQ: WIMI) is one of the few leading technology enterprises in the industry that possess full-stack self-developed artificial intelligence technology and adapt digital twin technology. The company has conducted in-depth research and development in big data, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and other fields. It has begun to extend its market applications into the digital information industry, smart industry, and digital twin industry.

Presently, leveraging its profound accumulation and technological precipitation in the field of technological construction over the years, WiMi is fully leveraging the product and technological advantages of leading companies in cloud computing, data centers, the Internet of Things, and ecological construction. It is gradually integrating new technologies with industries and continuously providing multi-scenario and digital solutions for industry customers, actively unleashing the potential of digital twin technology and making efforts in the intelligent digital transformation field.

It is worth noting that to further meet the development demands of socialization, personalization, service-oriented, and intelligence, WiMi will carry out virtual and real synergistic operations and efficient linkage in multiple domains and levels of scenarios. For example, with the increase in scenarios that combine VR, MR, and digital twins, WiMi can bring digital twin virtual offices to the scene, deepen the integration and evolution of digital technology and physical industries, and bring about a brand-new experience of reality and data integration, playing a significant role in the deepening stage of industrial transformation.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, as a key technology and important tool for improving efficiency, digital twins can effectively play their role in model design, data collection, simulation, and other aspects, promoting digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and facilitating the integration and development of digital economy and real economy. Faced with the new requirements of technological innovation and innovation in reality, with the continuous iteration and innovation of related technologies and the continuous improvement of industrial ecology, there is reason to expect that digital twins, as representatives of new productive forces, will become the key to tapping into the market of billions.",1712561959,823776,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,59381725b9724394c8c91415040749f897a2649f2cfdbaba6bdbf30a4fd8f01d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1byrzoi/digital_twin_technology_driving_the_fusion_of/

1049,"CPI Week Begins… 4-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Coming into today I had a pretty strong bull bias and was looking for the breakout off EMA support backtest overnight. However, we ended up just getting a very small and tight chop day. 

Generally speaking since sellers broke I am looking for a run up into CPI tomorrow. Tomorrow is Pre-CPI day and that can often times bring sizeable volatility. This will be a more interesting pre-CPI day to watch as the VIX is at 5 months highs and markets are just barely off ATHs while we are projected to get our third hotter CPI reading in a row.

Honestly not a whole lot to say here… we held daily 8ema support of 518.54. That is the bulls last stand… if we lose that support then we likely will head back to the daily 20ema support near 516.72.

The daily sellers once again weakened today so there really is not support or justification to go backtest 512.78-513.95 double demand support. 

Bulls need to bring daily buyers back in and then our breakout target will be the critical reconfirmed supply at 523.45.

Similarly on ES there really isn’t a ton of solid direction for tomorrow with this hanging man candle. The bullish side of things is that we held daily 20ema support and bounced directly off 5235 area. However, on a bearish side of things we did not retake or even break higher than Fridays HOD.

Bulls need to break through 5272 and target a bigger breakout to 5309 if daily sellers continue to weaken and daily buyers come back in. 

Bears will need to drop through 5235 daily 20ema support to then target a retest of double demand support at 5186-5197.

Similar play here on QQQ as SPY. The daily sellers weakened once again today but we could not break through Friday HOD/ resistance. 

The bulls also closed back under daily 8/20ema resistance too. 

Bulls need to break out over 443.17 to then target 443.94-446.44. 

Bears need to reject these daily 8/20ema resistances to then backtest double demand/ support at 433.84-435.33.

 Supply- 444.95 -> 446.44

Daily sellers once again weakened here on NQ too. We could not break through previous supply/ resistance at 18386 and also did not break through Fridays HOD. But we did manage to close on the daily 20ema support. 

Bulls need to breakout over 18386 to then target 18582 area. 

Bears need to continue to reject 18386 to then look for a retest of the 18053-18072 double demand/ support area.

To be honest I am a little surprised by the VIX and market movement today. We had a 5.24% drop on the VIX and more importantly a new supply/ rejection off the 16.45 level today. However, we barely closed green on SPY/ QQQ. 

Now I am very curious to see where the VIX will go tomorrow being pre-cpi day. I will be interested to see if we get a big run up into CPI or not on the VIX as people might start putting some longer dte put hedges on. 

14.75 is next key level to watch which is the daily 8ema support. 

One thing I am watching too is the fact that the VIX is sitting near 4 month high levels as we head into CPI… we could easily see a repeat of last CPI where we go “bad news” but because the VIX and volatility was so high we crushed and actually held steady/ rallied. As we saw on Friday due to massive IV crush options may be a losers game going into CPI Wednesday unless we truly get a major miss.

Today was one of my better days that I have had in quite a while. This morning I was looking for the overnight support to hold and lead to a breakout. I was able to get into a long in ES with two of my accounts and one NQ long in another MyFundedFutures account. Rode both for a nice win to hit well over my daily goal.

From there I was patient waiting for the mid day support to bounce and took a long in another APEX PA that I had sitting around. Overall a great day of trading here!

1063,"ALAB Astera Labs, one of the most obvious shorts in semiconductors"," 

$ALAB AKA Astera Labs is a recent IPO that markets itself as an AI play. The execs, numerous regarded financial analysts, IPO underwriters, WSB regards, and Twitter fake ass gurus believe it. But not me. And I'll break it down for you.

I have numerous friends working at the company. Prior to IPO, new employees that joined were given RSUs that were priced internally between $7-10 per share. They IPO'd at $36 per share but is currently $70 so to say its severely overbought is an understatement.

Up to November 2023, their website did not have a single usage of the word ""AI"". They revamped their marketing slides and web pages to include the word ""AI"" almost everywhere. In fact, in their S-1 IPO filing, they mentioned the word AI nearly 300 times: [Astera Labs, Inc. - S-1 - Registration Statement - February 21, 2024 (fintel.io)](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-astera-labs-inc-1736297-s1-2024-february-21-19774-3851)

Astera Labs main (and really, only) product is a PCI-Express retimer chip. The retimer market is expected to reach a global $296 million.... by 2028. Astera currently captures about 50% of the retimer market (in 2023). The current retimer market is about $150 million which means $75 million in REVENUE for Astera. It's market cap (using $70 per share) is $17 BILLION. Source: [The global retimer market is expected to reach an estimated (globenewswire.com)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/07/2719593/0/en/The-global-retimer-market-is-expected-to-reach-an-estimated-296-2-million-by-2028-with-a-CAGR-of-11-3-from-2023-to-2028.html)

Even using their IPO price of $36, this brings their market cap to $8 BILLION. Hell, even using their last internal RSU Grant to employees of $10 per share, its market cap is STILL a blistering $2.2 BILLION. And this is considering that their FUTURE revenue (assuming they only keep doing retimers) is capped at $296 MILLION by 2028 which is 4 YEARS AWAY. And there is no realistic way they would even capture 100% of that market. They have COMPETITION: [Broadcom Extends AI Workload Scale with Industry-First PCI Express Gen5/Gen6 Retimers | Markets Insider (businessinsider.com)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/broadcom-extends-ai-workload-scale-with-industry-first-pci-express-gen5-gen6-retimers-1033137625)

In fact, their competition offers retimers at a LOWER cost than Astera. The only advantage Astera has is first to market (with more than 50% of their revenue coming from ONLY 1 CUSTOMER, Intel!).

Now for the tech regards here who are soooo mad at me dunking on this company because they got $200 FD calls on this turd, let me shatter your dreams. Retimers are truly some of the LOWEST barrier to entry products that any semiconductor can have (about as easy to design and tape out than wireless transceiver chips). The reason why is because a retimer does not have all the nuts and bolts that a full PCIe Root Complex or PCIe Endpoint has. You can think of a retimer as a glorified signal booster (its not EXACTLY that, but for simplicity sake). ANY company that has a PCIe Endpoint or Root Complex product pretty much already have a retimer product that they can release into the market if they want (ie. literally every semiconductor company on the planet that has a PCIe product). To say that Astera is the only choice in their field with no competitive threat is a true WSB regard statement. Any company with a PCIe product, if they ever see Astera as a money maker, can EASILY swoop in and churn out their own retimer at a fraction of the cost as they ALREADY have it.

Disclosure, I used to work at Astera up to a few months ago where I switched to AMD (and this is after I vested some of my Astera shares). So technically, after my lockup is over, I'm still gonna make some bank but I truly believe this company is pumping the crap out of themselves.

1065,"Pre-CPI Day… 4-9-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

It is finally time for us to focus on the next CPI reading… this one in my opinion is a major deal. Why is it a major deal? Well this projected as of right now will be the third reading in a row that CPI has rebounded to the upside. JPOW very casually (and honestly I will again say mistakenly) waved off these hot CPI readings multiple times now saying that basically there was nothing to worry about. Initially markets really took that and ran with it. However, as we saw last week there was a fairly major adjustment to the expectations of when rate cuts are coming now because of these hotter CPI readings. 

Let get into the numbers… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gjw82xl9hitc1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c20d3828f649ce2df80e4e3a355ce6f79a7476

My Prediction-  
 CPI YoY- 3.5%  
 CPI MoM- 0.4%  
 CORE YoY- 3.8%  
 CORE MoM- 0.4%

Now this CPI we unfortunately don’t have a very narrow range due to the way numbers came in for Cleveland fed, Bloomberg and consensus so we can dig a little deeper here and see if we can narrow it down a little bit more. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yc5svty9hitc1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c340ac6cc63bda2dc97470447c9cc745e4f41512

Since Decembers CPI we have seen inflation come in at or higher than forecast (consensus) every single time. This is a big flip in trend as prior to December it actually liked to come in lower than consensus. Now this is likely due to oil and a few other factors driving things higher. Taking that into consideration we should see at least a 0.1-0.2% rise in CPI YoY and MoM compared to consensus… so that would give us CPI YoY 3.5-3.6% and MoM of 0.4-0.5%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8ord4cahitc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=94af85f18565af30e736dce219fd951e50df298d

Taking a look at some of the fed swaps and other forecasts out the most of them are coming in at 3.4-3.5% (rounded) for YoY and MoM at 0.3%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/csy7bfsahitc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0acfc80614d3c6b3d1ecaea41194adbb11eefa7

Now taking a look at the different market analyst and their predictions most of them are seeing CPI YoY at 3.4% and Core at 3.7%. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2q8wqs4bhitc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=40fab21a6d59e77c2a16bee0413304603d405b2e

The way I see it is this… the VIX is currently at the higher end of its 5 month resistance area. That makes it difficult because much like we saw last month on CPI day we had a big initial bearish reaction but it got bought up because volatility crushed like crazy. The numbers weren’t bad enough…. 

Now that’s where I do think this CPI is gonna be different… IF we get a CPI that comes in HIGHER than forecast I could truly see a -2% day on ES… there would be no way that JPOW or anyone can try to ignore the fact that CPI YoY bouncing back to 3.5% which as you can see by the chart above would be the highest reading since Octobers 3.7% reading. I have been saying it since before JPOW went all dove at the December 2023 FOMC meeting that there is a real base case where we do NOT get a single rate cut in 2024… if this current Oil trajectory continues and this trend on CPI bring YoY into the 4s… we are looking at a very real scenario of a rate HIKE at some point… of course the only way I honestly see us cutting before EOY is if a black swan happens. 

On the contrary IF we happen to get CPI to come in lower than forecast so that would be 3.3% or lower (especially if we get a rogue print at 3.2%) you can easily look at new ATHs in this market tomorrow. Bulls would absolutely run with that information. Truly of all the CPIs we have had lately I think both sides really do have an equal shot. 

The more bullish side of things and perhaps this is where the FED is getting their rate cut expectations from is the CORE YoY continues to tick lower. Since the peak March 2023 at 5.6% we have NOT seen a single CORE YoY print that has come in higher than previous. There has been a few unchanged though. The range of expectation for CORE YoY does give room for it to come in at 3.9% if we got the high side of deviation which would truly be a major bearish move. 3.9% CORE regardless of CPI YoY would also likely illicit a -2% day on ES/ SPY. However, again on the contrary… if we get 3.6% or lower CORE YoY which would show the 12th reading in a row to come in lower we might end up with another massive doji day. Market will need to decide whether a CPI or CORE reading is more important. 

Best bear reading= CORE YoY greater than or equal to 3.8% and CPI YoY greater than or equal to 3.4%

Best bull reading= CORE YoY less than or equal to 3.7% and CPI YoY less than or equal to 3.3%

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0zp4ozkbhitc1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f86be5453e9c591542e381ea28057dddb1defa

Right now the markets are giving about a 14% higher odds that June will be our first rate CUT. The market also has held steady that we will see 3 rate cuts by EOY by about a 4% margin for December 2024. 

If we get another hot CPI reading I expect markets to price in first rate CUT near September 2024 and very likely price in two cuts MAX. 

If we get a cold CPI reading then we could see the odds of a June cut increase. 

I am going to keep the TA brief tonight as we wait for CPI to move us… my thoughts are regardless of hot or cold CPI we will break this range… finally. 

Going into CPI tomorrow… I was VERY bearish last CPI and honestly in retrospect I was right to be bearish because it was hotter and markets are re-pricing in expectations. However, I have tried to be on team bull and I am doing my best here to support the bulls. Up until the final power hour run up we had probably one of the bearish technical setups for a CPI day we could have… however, bulls pushed it up just enough where it truly is a toss up tomorrow.

Taking a look at SPY we have stronger daily sellers once again. For the last month now all but 4 days we have seen sellers in the market. We are also nearing believe it or not extreme BEAR momentum… 

Breakout target for tomorrow is 523.45+ which would be a about a 1% move higher. 

Breakdown target is 512.78/ 512.95 and then 508.05-510.37. This would be a 2% drop on markets tomorrow. Full capitulation is 502 which is just under a -3.3% day. 

Realistically if we close under 508.05 demand then we are for sure going to see the bigger 10% correction. If we close over 523.45 we likely are gonna run until next FOMC in May. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 523.45  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37 -> 512.78 -> 512.95

Similar move here on Es in that we rejected Fridays hod area. Realistically they closes us nearly right in the middle of our range here… tomorrow is decision day. 

Breakout target is 5309+ which is about 1%+ breakout. 

Breakdown target is 5186-5197 and eventually 5126 (daily 50ema support) which would be about a -2% drop tomorrow. 

My thoughts would be a drop under and close under 5186 would start a more major correction in the market. A closure back over 5309 would start the next leg up. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5184 -> 5309  
 Demand- 5114 -> 5186 -> 5197

The bulls avoided by the absolute last sliver of possibility the bearish cross under of the daily 8 and 20emas. 

We have three major levels to watch on QQQ to the downside and three to the upside. 

Breakdown target are 433.84-435.33 (about -2%) and then full capitulation is 424.49 which is about -4%. 

Breakout targets are 443.94 and then a closure over 444.95-446.44 which is just under a 1% day up. 

Bulls need to CLOSE over 446.44 to start the next leg up and bears need to CLOSE under minimally 443.84-435.33 to start the major correction which would give me a target of the 100ema support near 416.96 area. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 444.95 -> 446.44  
 Demand- 416.96 -> 424.49 -> 433.84 -> 435.33 -> 443.94

NQ had another nice rejection off 18386 supply which makes that a very strong resistance to watch, however, we ended up closing just over it and barely defending the daily 20ema support. 

Breakout target is 18582 which is about a 2% green day and would likely bring the next leg up if we close over it. 

Breakdown targets are minimally 18053-18072 but ideally 17857-17980 which would be about a 1.5-2% drop. This would if we can close under 17857 give us a bigger target of 17579 minimally. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18386 -> 18582  
 Demand- 17579 -> 17857 -> 18053 -> 18072

The VIX is in a very sensitive spot right here… on one side of things here we were until the power hour pump on the markets and dump on the VIX set up to get a new demand which would have turned previous supply/ resistance into a new support/ demand. 

We are at an interesting spot here where the we are near 5 month highs on the VIX going into one of the most volatile inducing data points we get. If data comes in cool we could easily see VIX back into the low 13s. However, if CPI is hot then we likely will put a new demand in today and easily could see VIX breakout 20-30%... this would be confirmation of our next leg down. 

Bears want to see a VIX breakout tomorrow where it closes hear HOD with SPY and QQQ CLOSED under daily 20ema and well under Fridays support. 

Bulls want to see the VIX minimally back in the 13s and see SPY/ QQQ close over the range resistance and an ATHs if possible.

Ended up pulling a small red day overall today. I wasn’t able to get in on the major drop we had at opening unfortunately. From there though I was looking for the recovery. I attempted to go long around 1055 and of course didn’t get filled before it instantly popped. From there I was looking for the failed recovery and rejection lower. 

I got stopped out once and then re-entered short. I got stopped out at the high to the tick at 1230pm. Which of course was the high of move. I was able to get in another short shortly after that to that saw about 7-8pts before reversing higher. Overall a small red day. 

In one of my other MFFU 50ks I traded NQ and took a loss on one short and then ended up with a nice short win to recover my losses and then some. 

I didn’t trade my other MFFU today as I didn’t like anything enough and I didn’t touch my APEX either.

1066,Gold Reserve (GDRZF)'s $1.1 Billion Award is closer than ever (3X incoming),"In one of the largest legal victories against a sovereign nation in recent history, Gold Reserve Inc. (GDRZF)  is on the verge of receiving a monumental $1.1 billion payout from the Venezuelan government. The forthcoming award marks the culmination of a grueling 15-year international arbitration and domestic court battle waged by the junior mining company.  
  
Gold Reserve's legal saga began in 2009 when the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez's administration unceremoniously revoked the company's rights to the promising Brisas gold and copper mining project. In an aggressive move decried by critics as outright expropriation, Chavez's socialist government canceled Gold Reserve's mining concessions and seized the company's assets in the mineral-rich region without paying any compensation.  
  
The Canadian firm was initially awarded $713 million by an arbitration tribunal in 2014 to cover its lost investments in the Brisas project as well as other mining prospects taken over by Venezuela. However, the cash-strapped Venezuelan government at the time agreed to settle the dispute in 2016 for a higher $1.032 billion payment.  
  
But Venezuela quickly fell into default on the settlement, only paying around $250 million before halting further disbursements. As the outstanding balance continued accruing interest, the award owed to Gold Reserve has now grown to over $1.1 billion.  
  
The turning point for Gold Reserve came in a separate but parallel case launched by Crystallex, another mining firm whose Venezuelan assets were also expropriated by the Chavez regime. 

In 2018, Crystallex won a landmark ruling in U.S. federal court declaring that Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA was the ""alter ego"" of Venezuela.  
  
This controversial legal determination allowed Crystallex to move forward with seizing shares in PDVSA's American subsidiary firm Citgo as a means to satisfy its now $1.1 billion arbitration award against Venezuela. After numerous appeals, the ruling was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022.  
  
With the critical alter ego ruling in place, Crystallex and other mining and oil firms holding arbitration awards against Venezuela have been authorized by U.S. courts to force an outright sale of Citgo and its lucrative American oil refineries. The high-stakes auction of the multi-billion dollar company is now scheduled for July 2024, with preliminary stalking horse bids already being accepted.  
  
Experts estimate that if Citgo sells for its projected price of $7 billion or higher, the proceeds would be sufficient to pay out Gold Reserve's full $1.1 billion arbitration award after taxes and incentives. This would represent a remarkable over 300% recovery (based on current stock prices) for current Gold Reserve  shareholders after over a decade of vehement legal battles against the Venezuelan government.  
  
The first round of non bidding for Citgo came in at $7.3 billion, and it is expected the second round will be for a higher amount, thereby fully covering gold reserve’s claim.   
  
An opportunity like this rarely comes along. Have at it.

1073,High-reward Watchlist - Moonshot Potential,"Morning, folks! Your friendly neighborhood stock watcher here with some picks that might just make your week (hint: there are a couple of dark horses in the mix). We’re talking CISS, HIRU, SPQS, & TOON today. And remember, just sharing for fun, not telling you where to put your money!

**Let’s Break Down $SPQS - SportsQuest, Inc.** Recently hit $0.0016, up by +18.52%. Looks like SPQS is feeling pretty good, maybe because of its new ventures in China and dabbling in AI.

* **What’s Hot?** Its price has been all over the place, from $0.0006 to $0.0022 over the past year, suggesting there might be some growth potential left.
* **The Deets:** With its market cap at $3.911 million and trading volume on the rise, SPQS is getting some attention. If the technical signs are right, it could be signaling a green light.

**On to $HIRU - HIRU Corp** It’s a bit like betting on the underdog with HIRU, given its tiny trade values. But, who doesn’t love a good underdog story?

* **What’s New:** They’ve brought in a new mining COO with a diverse background. Could mean new energy and ideas for HIRU.

* **Big Picture:** For a company in the marine shipping world, strong financials plus any positive global shipping or oil news could buoy CISS further.
* **Predicting the Tide:** Keeping the sails up, CISS could potentially hit $0.0450 to $0.0500 by week’s end.

**Wrapping up with $TOON - Kartoon Studios** As folks lean more into digital and educational content, TOON’s latest success stories suggest it’s on the right track.

* **Why It’s Cool:** With digital entertainment demand up, TOON’s spot in the industry could help it capture more attention.
* **Looking Forward:** If the wind keeps blowing in the right direction, TOON could make its way to the $1.60 to $1.70 mark, riding the wave of current enthusiasm and industry trends.

1074,Sturdy Spotlight: $VTGN is on its way to no longer becoming a penny stock,"I can't lie, this stock has really caught my attention recently. Although there has really only been consolidation for all of 2024, in early April a notable amount of volume has come back. The price rose 30% in a day and is currently trying to make a local swing high at $5.78. This checks all the boxes on my technical analysis investment strategy, but I would still like to dive deep into the fundament side. Be on the lookout for more information and make sure you add this stock to your watchlist. If the price can break about $5.78, there might be a lot of gains to be made.

**Exit Point**: A potential exit strategy could be set by targeting the next major resistance, possibly the peak of the previous high around $6.50 or higher, assuming the pattern completion and breakout occur. Alternatively, if entering upon the breakout, a trailing stop could be placed just below the trendline or the 200-day moving average to lock in profits should the price reverse.

1077,"CPI and FOMC Minute Day Volatility… 4-10-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

I made a prediction of where CPI might come in at today… and completely nailed it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nsyxrwgdmptc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf9090c6406ca4da510f6ac2313aeeda41b73f7

However, despite the fact that we got truly some extremely hot CPI data all around the board and missed forecast on each and every one… the bears once again just could not do anything with it intraday. The whole move happened pre market and once again intraday we were left with no direction and chop. Honestly I knew this market was resilient and that we are in a clear bull market/ bull trend but truly today shows us just how regardedly strong and resilient this market is… which also is a bit comical when you consider that we dumped last week on Thursday because of something a fed member said but when we get hard core bearish and not good long term data the markets essentially shrugged it off… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hlsanuudmptc1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e566d34523b4f021392524e2ed2d9a1c4c7651b

For the first time in a very long time the markets are officially price in a more hawkish rate forecast than the fed has projected. Right now we are seeing the highest odds of our first rate cut in September 2024 and then one more rate cut in December 2024. Yes that means we went from December 2023 (5 months ago) of expecting SEVEN rate cuts to now expecting TWO rate cuts… and honestly I would be shocked (outside of a black swan event) if we get ANY rate cuts in 2024… unless some how inflation takes an unnatural nose dive or we get bank failures (something to push the feds hand) there realistically is zero data to support rate cuts… we are almost 2x higher than the feds goal of 2%... next FOMC is going to be very interesting to watch too. 

&#x200B;

Today actually was a pretty big data day with CPI and FOMC Minutes at 2pm… post-data days on CPI we have generally seen the last 9 out of 12 post-cpi days open green and 8 out of 12 close green… Marchs CPI was the first time since August 2023 that we had seen a red Post-CPI day… we likely can expect another since we got hotter data… 

Now on FOMC minutes (the dates are in reverse sorry just how I tracked them)… we are seeing that 6 out of the last 11 post- FOMC minute days opened green and 5 out of 11 closed green… most noteable is the last post-FOMC minutes day opened and closed very green (I believe this was our biggest green day of 2024). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ppcz9lpemptc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9ba91c5bf9cdff13c562adb90de2689df9e333d

Tomorrrow we will get PPI at 830am… currently we are projected to be much lower than previous… However, you can see that the last 5 months of PPI MoM has been in a steady uptrend and CORE PPI MoM has also been flat with a big spike last month. 

Much like CPI the last two readings on PPI has come in HIGHER than forecast… which if on the backs of this CPI day could bring a very large red day. 

Honestly… like I was saying in my post last night I was BEARISH on CPI data which was correct but I was bullish from a technical stand point which I guess with this intraday chop and ranging was also correct… I have never seen a market that refuses to go and hold red the way we have the last month or two. Its actually a bit mind blowing. The failure rate of short setups is pretty incredible. 

To be completely honest I don’t think in my wildest dreams I would have expected markets to range all day long (after the initial drop) with all four metrics coming in hotter than forecast. Nothing in my wildest dreams woulda lead me to believe that ES would hold a 17pt range and NQ would hold a 70pt range a majority of the trading day… of all the days we had the highest probability to get a trend day today was it and we still chopped.

I have shown you guys this chart 9 other times… every single time the following day on average has been a 1% green day… will we see that repeat tomorrow? Or is this time actually different? 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u9kcgbjfmptc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd83a5ad005bc06ae2283a9919ef1812e0d6b15e

We finally on SPY got the supply that we were threatening yesterday. We also closed our first full candle below the 8 and 20ema support since February 21st. We continues to see stronger daily sellers come into the market too. 

However, this inverted hammer candle here actually has a very high probability in being the bottom. We also have not in nearly 6 months been able to see continuation lower from here. Now is this time different? I am not so sure. I would have thought if the bears were going to finally correct us that it would have happened today with a bigger red candle and far more bearish close closer to the daily 50ema support. 

Honestly looking at this failure to break and close under 512.78-513.05 I have nothing but bullish feelings here. The bears with literally the perfect setup failed to close under critical demand and range support. 

Bulls will look to targeta nd retake the daily 8ema resistance at 517.77 tomorrow with a bigger target of 520.6.

Bears could take this lower tomorrow and if they can close under 512.78-513.05 double demand/ support we could look for a flush to daily 50ema support near 508.05.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 523.45 -> 520.6  
 Demand- 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37 -> 512.78 -> 513.95

Taking a look at ES here we also got a new supply at 5266 and closed back under the daily 8 and 20ema supports. We do not have a bearish cross under of EMAs yet but we do have stronger daily sellers and the strongest selling since 4/4/24 which was the last time we closed under 20ema. 

Much like SPY here we came down and despite making a new recent low we just could not get through that 5186-5197 daily double demand/ support. With this level holding I am looking a double bottom bounce higher tomorrow for markets. Truly with this massive failed breakdown we could see this whole drop recovered tomorrow and could see a new ATHs by EOW. 

Bulls will target a move back to daily 8ema resistnace of 5249 and eventually a move back to 5266 supply. 

Bears need to close under this daily double demand support of 5186-5197 in order to see a move down to daily 50ema support near 5130. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5158 -> 5266 -> 5309

Now taking a look at QQQ here we put in a new supply at 442.98. However, the bears were not able to break through the critical range support of 433.84-435.33. The bears really need to break this range support to confirm that a market correction is coming. 

What is truly incredible here is the fact that we actually have stronger daily BUYERS today… yes QQQ/ NQ closed down nearly 1% and yet we have daily buyers… that is different to say the least.

With this failure to break through range we very well could be looking at a major upside bounce tomorrow on markets. We do however have our first bearish cross under of the daily 8 and 20ema during this bull run. 

Bulls need to retake daily 8/20ema resistance at 440.63 to un-crossunder the EMAs. This will give them an upside target of the supplies from 442.98-446.44.

Bears need to reject the EMAs and look to close under double demand/ daily 50ema support of 433.84-435.33. IF they do then our bigger target is 424.49 demand. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 442.98 -> 444.95 -> 446.44  
 Demand- 424.49 -> 433.84 -> 435.33 -> 433.94

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

I think the most impressive thing about NQ today is that fact that from open until the final 15 minutes it never closed over or under its 15min ORB range. Meaning the high of the 15min candle and low of the first 15min candle never were closed over/ under… that is some of the most extreme consolidation I have ever seen on NQ intraday. 

We were able to double double top and reconfirm 18389 as supply and resistance. The bears were however, not able to get us through 18053-18072 double demand support. Right now NQ is sandwhiched between reconfirmed demand and support at 18072 and reconfirmed support and resistance at 18389. We realistically need to see one of these levels closed over/ under to get the next direction in this market. 

Bulls need to retake and close over 18389 supply in order to then target the upper range resistance of 18582.

Bears are not in control until we break through the daily 50ema support and double demand support of 18053-18072. This then gives us a bigger target of 17579.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18389 -> 18582  
 Demand- 17579 -> 17857 -> 17980 -> 18053 -> 18072

I am actually very surprised to see that the VIX was so tame today… we didn’t even make a new recent high on the VIX and once again rejected 16.45 supply. The biggest thing I am noticing is that we have moved our range from 12.44-15 up to now being demand/ support at 14.97 to 16.45. 

The VIX is riding the daily 8 and 20ema supports and continuiously bouncing off of those levels remaining in its uptrend. The VIX actually appears to have a massive daily bull flag here which if that plays out would lead to a huge breakout to the 17-18 area on the VIX and COULD lead the market lower. 

However, on the contrary if they decide to crush the VIX… with it being so elevated like this it could absolutely lead to some incredibly impressive bullish squeeze days. 

**US 10YR YIELD DAILY**

&#x200B;

I am not sure what is going on with TOS but my US10YR chart never updated for the day and just shows it being completely untraded. So I am showing you my TV chart here. Actually I just realized that TOS has stopped trading the TNX ticker since April 1st. That is odd. I have found a new ticker /10Y which appears to be the 10yr micro futures… however, I need to take the time to go and redo all my levels on that. Likely this weekend as it will take a lot of time. 

The 10YR put in an ew supply yesterday at 4.423% and a new demand today at 4.364%. This is a major breakout of 4.3% on the 10YR today on the backs of CPI, 10yr auction and FOMC minutes… this 10YR rate is pretty clear that yields do not think we are seeing rate cuts anytime soon. Next major upside target is 4.646% from the November 2023 highs. 

US 10YR YIELD DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4.423 -> 4.473 -> 4.646%  
 Demand- 4.199 -> 4.312 -> 4.364%

Taking a look at the dollar here we also had a major breakout of 1% on DXy. We put in a new demand here at 104.107 which also was a major support bounce off the daily 50ema support and bullish channel support. 

We also closed over 104.972 which gives us the highest DXY close since November 13th 2023. Right now next major upside resistance and targets are 105.927-106.135 from October 2023. 

VIX, DXY and US10YR have all have the correct trend bears need to take this market lower and give us our bull market 5-10% HEALTHY correction… the only thing missing is the actual price action to do it. 

DXY/ US DOLLAR DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 104.972 -> 105.927   
 Demand- 103.384 -> 104.107

I did a clarification explaination on my picture above which explains everything today better as I wanted to have transparency. 

Honestly I went into today bearish if we got hotter than forecast CPI… we got that data but we just werent bearish… I was trying to find the top on the opening hour run up and lost two accounts being way too early and aggressive. I truly thought that we would open see a small 15-30 minute relief bounce and then likely continue to bear trend lower and get a -2% day. We just didn’t get that and it cost me. I honestly don’t hate any of the three shorts I took because they all fit my strategy we just got reversal higher that I didn’t see coming. This actually reminded me a lot of yestersday recovery where I didn’t see justification or reasoning for why we kept going higher but yet we did.",1712780070,823889,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,a5f420c7e4ab6e5581f956a73166a5f50a4e3a6f62b15880f35604ed888187ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1c0vbwc/cpi_and_fomc_minute_day_volatility_41024_spy_es/

1079,Multi-Year Highs: Silver Sector Stability Amid Global Uncertainty + Summa Silver's (SSVR.v) Breakthrough at its Mogollon Project,"According to FXEmpire, silver prices have remained stable near multi-year highs amid global tensions and emerging inflation risks, driven by factors like central bank stockpiling and industrial demand. Additionally, there's anticipation of silver outperforming gold due to expected growth in investment demand. 

https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/silver-prices-forecast-xag-usd-set-to-outshine-gold-driven-by-investor-demand-1422521

Amidst the vibrant silver sector, Summa Silver Corp. (Ticker: SSVR.v or SSVRF for US investors) has unveiled significant findings from its exploration endeavors at the Mogollon Project in New Mexico.

During the initial drilling operation at the South Queen target within the project area, a substantial deposit of high-grade silver-gold mineralization was uncovered. 

https://preview.redd.it/ulpfuslzpqtc1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=13b44dc6f133cc40c567e3c9bc124207ca393770

The discovery showcases impressive statistics, with 393 grams per tonne (g/t) of silver equivalent, including 64 g/t of silver and 3.9 g/t of gold, spread over a span of 7.4 meters. 

Particularly noteworthy within this find was the uncovering of a striking result of 2,735 g/t silver equivalent, comprising 320 g/t of silver and 28.6 g/t of gold, over a distance of 1.5 meters.

This unveiling marks a significant milestone for Summa Silver, shedding light on the substantial potential concealed beneath the surface of the Mogollon Project.

The validation of these discoveries not only underscores the thoroughness of geological modeling endeavors but also points towards promising opportunities within the untapped territories of the Queen Vein. With mineralization extending along-strike and down-dip, there is a compelling rationale for further exploration and drilling initiatives.

Situated amidst the historical Deadwood and Eberle mines, previously exploited primarily at surface levels, the newly identified mineralized zone reveals previously untapped depths teeming with silver and gold mineralization.

With assay results exceeding initial expectations, Summa Silver is strategically positioning itself for significant expansion and growth prospects.

On the other hand, industry is an important carrier for the development of digital economy. Digital economy enables the development of industries and builds a modern industrial system with international competitiveness. Digital economy with digital platform strengthens the upstream and downstream cooperation of the traditional industrial chain, promotes the competitiveness of the industrial chain, and realizes the middle and high end of the value chain.

The digital economy is opening up entirely new possibilities, leading the public into an unprecedented new era.  
At the same time, at this critical stage, the proposal of new quality productivity will promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and cloud computing with all links of traditional industries, build a new ecology of intelligent manufacturing industry, and constantly provide momentum support for the development of digital economy.

**WiMi for high-quality development**

I believe that in the future, WiMi will further integrate the development of the digital economy and the real economy, which will surely promote the cultivation and development of new quality productive forces, so that more people can share the new fruits of digital development.

**To sum up**  
Digital economy has become an important starting point for the development of new quality productive forces. The country has issued a number of policies to support the cultivation of digital ecological environment, accelerate the integration of innovation chain and industrial chain, so as to promote high-quality economic and social development.

1085,Double Due Diligence for Some of My Top Picks,"Good morning, folks! Today, I'm diving into a detailed analysis of two exciting stocks from yesterday's picks: HIRU and TOON. Let’s unpack these stories. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

**First, let's talk about $TOON: Kartoon Studios**

**Overview:**  
Kartoon Studios has been on a tear with acquisitions like WOW Unlimited and Ameba TV, and major collaborations including TOHO Studios and Shaquille O’Neal. Watch out for Shaq's Garage premiering on June 5, 2024 - it’s going to be big!

**Financials:**  
From a cool $1.4 million in Q1 2022 to an eye-popping $14.2 million in Q1 2023, TOON's revenues are skyrocketing. With assets worth $114.3 million and a strong working capital of $23.5 million, they’re geared up for even more growth.

**Interesting Info:**  
TOON isn’t just about cartoons; it’s about heavy-hitters like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer Garner who add star power to shows that mix learning with fun. Their titles like ""Shaq’s Garage"" and ""Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten"" are just a taste of their innovative approach.

**Why Keep an Eye on TOON?**

* **Explosive Growth:** That revenue jump? It speaks volumes.
* **Smart Acquisitions:** WOW Unlimited and Ameba TV are just the start.
* **Star Power:** Big names bring big attention.
* **Rich Content Library:** From Stan Lee to modern celebs, they’ve got it all.
* **Financial Health:** Strong fundamentals to support ambitious projects.
* **Merch Potential:** Toys and shirts mean more cash.
* **Global Reach:** They're everywhere you want to be.

And the chart? It’s looking ready for some serious action, possibly matching analyst James McIlree’s ambitious $10.00 target - a whopping 415% potential gain!

**Next up, $HIRU: HIRU Corporation**

**Overview:**  
Diverse is the name of the game for HIRU Corp, spanning critical metal mining to bottled water production. This mixed bag helps them steady the ship through market ups and downs.

**Financials:**  
Innovative integration strategies across its business units amplify both resource efficiency and profitability, especially in high-stakes sectors like lithium and tungsten mining.

**Interesting Info:**  
As the world leans into electric vehicles and green energy, HIRU’s projects in lithium, tin, and tungsten are critical. They’re well-placed in mineral-rich regions, ready to meet growing market demands.

**Why HIRU?**

* **Diverse Operations:** Stability through variety.
* **Sector Growth:** Positioned to profit from tech advances.
* **Strategic Locations:** Right where the resources are.
* **Market Alignment:** On the right side of future trends.
* **Value Buy:** Priced at just $0.0005, the risk/reward ratio is intriguing.

Given its recent 20% gain, HIRU might just repeat that performance today. It’s a higher stakes game, so watch this one closely!

Drop your thoughts below and let’s chat about these picks! Cheers for making it through the analysis

1087,"$SPQS Long-Anticipated Merger With Huaying Online Film Co., Ltd. Has Entered Its Final Stages","$SPQS has been on my watchlist for a couple of weeks now. It first caught my eye with its extremely low price. At its current price of $10, I could get around 9,000 shares, which was outstanding to me.

News has been consistently coming out, but its most recent release of the merger in its final stages is up-and-coming. They also released their full China AI disclosure filing & updated business plan.

**Key Takeaways**

* The company has currently acquired 12 movie theaters and 3 more under acquisition, located in major cities in China.
* The company employs a total of 139 employees at the headquarters and various theaters.
* The company is planning to acquire 50 cinemas by the end of 2024; and expand to 150 in 2025; and reach 500 in 2028. At the same time, through independent research and development of AI technology.
* The company is expected to manage 1,000 franchised cinemas in 2025-2026, becoming China's leading cinema chain brand.
* The company's goal is to achieve 70% market share.

I am going to continue to monitor this one to see if I can snipe an entry with an excellent risk-to-reward ratio. I am also providing the full news report in the links below. Here is the chart I am looking at! Yesterday was extremely volatile so be careful out there!

1088,Capri (CPRI),"In August 2023, Tapestry (TPR / owner of Coach, Kate Spade / Stuart Weitzman) announced their proposed acquisition of Capri Holdings (CPRI / owner of Michael Kors, Versace, Jimmy Choo)

Why does this trade so poorly given $57 acquisition price by Tapestry? At $42, CPRI has 35% unlevered upside to acquisition price.

EU will likely decide by 4/15 which seems likely to go through given (1) Tapestry’s limited Europe presence (2) significantly lower combined market share in Europe to its large competitors (LVMH/Richemont/Kering/Hermes).. There is no indication that the EU would pursue a breakup of those luxury conglomerates so unlikely to rule adversely in this merger.

Why wouldn’t the US FTC approve the deal? FTC closed door meeting was removed from site and there are several articles/research with supportive opinions from antitrust attorneys. How does this harm consumers? There were additional reports that Bates White was hired to consult on blocking this deal, but there are no sign they are hired for this deal as they have no meaningful relevant experience on luxury goods / handbags…

Merger agreement allows for regulatory approval process to stretch into 2025. Even if they received adverse opposition from the FTC, why wouldn’t they win in court? Again, how does this merger harm US consumers?

Meanwhile Tapestry has completed issuance of the debt and received the cash required to complete the acquisition. All executive statements around earnings call infer no major road bumps and if there was new news on where the FTC was leaning, wouldn’t either company need to disclose in an 8K (if negative) or it’d leak?

1091,"Will Markets Close at ATHs Tomorrow? 4-11-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, and DXY/ US Dollar Daily Market Analysis","  

Yesterday the question was bull trap or bear trap… todays answer is just like always… bear trap. We indeed once again are not different and the markets 100% bought the dip. I have an explanation for those of you not understanding why. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uxogd276qwtc1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=07e3ed33e3faddc31a86b18376ec5abf8f8a631b

Right now markets are BARELY pricing in two rate cuts by EOY 24. However, as you can see there is already a 12.1% odds that we get no rate cuts by EOY (which is what I have been saying since December 2023). Now the thing is PPI did come in cooler today and now we will wait for PCE data. However, the thing is (and this is where you gotta think like the market… remember the market doesn’t like surprises), the market now 100% knows inflation is hot and that most likely the fed is screwed and will not be cutting rates in 2024. Despite the fact that JPOW spent the last 3 months telling us that the base case was 75bps of cuts we now see that the market completely disregarded the fed. Why does that matter? Well the things is that market reactions and doesn’t really anticipate…. So we had the reaction to the fact that the fed is not going to cut rates… we also already had the reaction to the fact that inflation is hot and not coming down. 

Now what happens? Well we likely will continue to see reactions negatively to initial hot data that continues to further claim that inflation is hot and no rate cuts. However, when we get good supportive data like PPI today we are likely going to see massive squeezes to the upside. The thing is realistically until FOMC in may there is nothing data wise (of course outside of a black swan) that can kill this market. I actually believe we are about to start our next major leg up here. 

&#x200B;

I have shown you guys this chart numerous times (10 times to be exact) and every time the bulls have bought the dip. However, this time it appears we are actually repeating the mid to late February double double bottom pattern. This daily support bounce and massive double bottom (like I said I was looking for today) realistically sets us up for a massive squeeze tomorrow and I could easily see us close our week out at ATHs tomorrow. 

Honestly todays recovery especially on NQ to completely recover all of yesterdays CPI drop and then some is wildly impressive. We used to get two day squeezes during the early days of this bull run and I do wonder if we are going to see that tomorrow… the classic VIX crush Friday and market squeeze to ATHs.

On SPY we have had a bearish down channel that realistically is a much longer term bull flag that we just broke out of to the upside today. We also put in a new demand on SPY today at 513.45. This gives us one massive demand/ support from 508.05-513.45. 

To the upside we continue to have our major resistance of 520.6 to 523.45 which is our range resistance since March. The only thing bulls are missing right now is daily buyers…

Bulls need to break through both of these resistance tomorrow and close over 523.45 minimally in order to see a major breakout next week. ATHs is roughly 1-1.25% from close today. This is pretty doable and for most of our squeeze days 1%+ is what we get. 

Bears could technically still reject this 520.6 supply and send this back under the daily 20ema support tomorrow. IF they did then our early next week target would be 512.78-513.45 which would likely be another long/ bounce opp.

SPY DAILY LEVELS

Taking a look at ES here we once again saw daily sellers weakened and more importantly the bulls avoided entering extreme bear momentum. With a new daily demand at 5202 we have built a massive triple demand/ support area from 5186-5202 which we failed 4 times to break through in the last week or so. 

Bulls were able to recover back over the EMAs today and avoided the bearish cross under for the EMAs that we were showing at LOD. Now we need to take out major resistance at 5266 which would lead to a breakout to even more major supply at 5309.

Bulls need to breakout and close minimally over 5309 tomorrow to set them up for a major breakout next week. 

If bears can hold either 5266 or 5309 as resistance we might see a retrace back down to daily 20ema support of 5236.

Now the one thing that makes me believe that this rally to the upside is not only real but is sustainable through new ATHs is the fact that big tech now is leading the rally. If you remember for basically the last month I talked about the fact that ES/Spy were so much more bullish and strong than QQQ/NQ. However, tech was strong enough on the bear side that it limited the upside potential on ES/SPY. Now that tech is leading this rally and leading the charge we are going to see the more sustainable rally to the upside. Big tech as a whole got a major boost today. 

On QQQ we now have back to back days of daily buyers and we put in a new demand at 436.95. This now establishes a major demand/ support area at 433.84-436.95. My upside target today was honestly only the daily 8/20ema but we completely over shot that and now we are looking at a major move into the triple supply/ resistance area from 442.98-446.44. 

I honestly would not be surprised to see a pretty strong gap up over night tomorrow and for bulls to open potentially even at ATHs. However, I would be very surprised to see QQQ/ NQ not hit new ATHs tomorrow. 

Bulls target is simply to close over ATHs tomorrow which is less than a 1% green day for the Qs. 

Bears need to find massive resistance and rejection here which it has for the last month. IF they can hold this final supply and resistance then we may see a flush back to support at the daily 8/20ema near 441.77.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 442.98 -> 444.95 -> 446.44  
 Demand- 433.84 -> 435.33 -> 436.95 

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

The one thing I was looking for on NQ and ES over night was the major double bottom. The one thing I feared and what kept me out of holding the longs I had over night (I had profitable TPs set before I fell asleep) was the fact that I was afraid we could backtest 5180 and 18072 area. We ended up getting the flush on PPI which ended up being the greatest long opportunity this market has seen in weeks. Nearly 425 points total from LOD to HOD. 

With a new demand at 18193 that now should be considered major resistance. As you can see the bulls broke out of our major bull flag resistance and not only that but broke through and closed over 18389 reconfirmed major supply. 

My upside target today for NQ was simply 18300 area and we completely pumped through that. With a closure over this supply our next major resistance and target is 18582. On the weekly timeframe 18569 is the major level to watch. If we close over that level then we likely are looking at a major breakout to 19000 in the near future. 

Bulls need to simply close over 18582 tomorrow. 

Bears must hard reject 18582 and look to close under 18389 tomorrow. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18389 -> 18582  
 Demand- 18072 -> 18193

The VIX was a bit interesting this morning as the VIX opened green and actually went on a pretty major pump for a while. We also had a very random and rogue 10% spike that caused the VIX to freeze and one point before it dropped back to flat. 

With this major rejection off 16.45 supply and now a new supply at 15.81. I am going to look for this major bull channel and bull flag to fail tomorrow with a downside target of 14.17-14.54 on the VIX. IF we go lower than that it will be the fuel the bulls need for the next major squeeze. 

Like I said before CPI there was a risk with VIX and volatility so high that despite strongly hot data we could still see a major squeeze to the upside.

The 10YR likely due to the bond auction actually maintained a green day today and continues its move towards 4.654%. I also think since the markets are continuing to push out their forecast for rate cuts and lowering their expectations for rate cuts that we will not see the 10YR sell off anytime soon.

The dollar appears to be putting a topping candle in here with this nice doji. We have been in such a long and strong bull trend on the DXY that we likely are going to see some pullback here. 

It actually is very encouraging seeing the DXY green today and NQ so green today. We have been seeing so much weakness from NQ/ QQQ likely due to the incredible strength in the dollar which hurts big tech in the long run. I am looking to see if DXY will pullback to 104.107 or push higher to 105.927 area.

Straight up killed it today but man did I leave so much profits on the table. 

I was eyeing all night a long and ended up taking a long and setting BE stops in my eval I had left and my on PA. I woke up late in the night and set at 5pt be on ES and 20pt BE on NQ which thankfully I did because then we got that major sell off that would have blew my account. 

I was looking all morning long for that 5180 support area to hold and in my APEX accounts I went long looking for the major breakout which we did get. I still had some trust issues and of course set some profitable stops which got me. I ended up stop trading the lower of my APEX PAs because I don’t want any consistency issues there as I aim for about $1k/ day. 

I had a great long off 5191.5 that I got stopped out at my 5pt BE before it pushed more. I also had a BE long stop set off 5202.25 that came down on a hard 5min retrace then completely bounced right off my stop and ripped. From there I had to wait for the bond auction and it just straight pumped so hard and fast I was left in the dust and never got an opportunity to go long again. By then it felt like straight FOMO so I just sat cash and watched it all day. 

Overall a great day of trading and I look to continue it tomorrow. Realistically I am only looking for longs in this market until we have a clear bear day. There is just such a high failure rate on all shorts that I have no desire to take them anymore. The best plays are also waiting for support to be built to then go long. I do still need to work on setting better stops and TPs to allow some of these plays to run for bigger upside. I had major upside targets that all got hit today but I was stopped out (profitable) before that move ever happened.

1096,American Aires Announces Record Q4 and Annual 2023 Order Volume and Significant Q4 EBITDA Profitability," 

**• Record quarterly order volume of $3.7 million and gross margin of 59%¹**  
**• Record annual order volume of $10.4 million (79% increase YoY) and gross margin of 61%¹**  
**• First significant adjusted quarterly EBITDA profitability¹** 

Toronto, Ontario (April 11, 2024) - American Aires Inc. (CSE:WIFI;  OTC Pink:AAIRF) (""Aires"" or the ""Company”),  a pioneer in cutting-edge  technology designed to protect against  electromagnetic radiation and  optimize human health, is pleased to  announce the filing the Company’s  Financial Statements and Management’s  Discussion & Analysis  (MD&A) for the year ended December 31,  2023 and disclose key  performance metrics (non-IFRS and unaudited  financial results). To keep  financial results comparable on a YoY basis  while making them  consistent with ongoing and future reporting, all  figures below combine  the results of Aires and those achieved by HUCK  Project LLC (“HUCK”)  pursuant to the Distributor-Royalty agreement  initially announced on  August 28, 2023 and which has been subsequently  terminated by mutual  agreement of the parties, as announced on February  16, 2024.   

The Aires  team is proud of its Q4 2023 performance, achieving  record order volume  of $3.7 million,1 largely due to enhancements made  to Aires’ marketing  and advertising strategy. The increased order  volume represents strong  growth YoY (up $1.3 million for 53% growth),  while advertising and  promotion expenses grew by only a modest $0.3  million YoY as we continue  to scale up our growth engine, and marketing  costs were slightly  reduced by 2% YoY.   

The  record level of quarterly order volume was achieved despite a  temporary  shortage of product that limited sales. The related supply  chain  constraint has now been resolved, and the Company has been fully  stocked  since that time thanks to the negotiation of new supply terms  and  increased working capital from our recently closed $4 million  financing,  as announced on February 16, 2024.   

The  Company’s most important quarterly achievement was reporting  its first  significant adjusted quarterly EBITDA profitability at  $77,750, which is  a milestone that underscores the Company’s ongoing  strategic delivery  of shareholder value. EBITDA adjustments are for  inclusion of HUCK  results and non-recurring expenses associated with  restructuring and  other one-time costs. Please see “Adjusted EBITDA  Reconciliation Table  for Q4/2023” below for more details.   

The  Aires team is equally proud of its annual performance in 2023  on  multiple fronts. The Company drove an impressive order volume  increase  of 79% YoY to $10.4 million (up from $5.8 million in 2022).  The strong  order volume financial results are a direct result of the  brand-building  vision of American Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, and his  ability to  consistently drive growth, such as 2022’s order volume  increase of 128%  YoY. As with previous years, the main catalyst for  revenue growth was  Bruni’s measured, data-driven and iterative growth  engine.   

**American  Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, commented:** ""This  success builds on the hard work  and sustainable growth we’ve  demonstrated over the past 2 years. These  financial results are just  the latest proof that we have what it takes  to reach and convert the  massive and growing consumer market focused on  wellbeing and EMF  protection. Now it’s time to focus on making 2024 our  best year ever  and continuing our trajectory of significant revenue  growth. That means  staying the course but with the welcomed advantage of  working with a  larger budget. That will involve ramping up our  predictable growth  engine to drive further revenue increases and  deepening and widening  our relationships with athletes, celebrities and  performers to elevate  Aires to the level of household brand.”   

Gross  margin as a percentage in 2023 was mostly in line at 61%  relative to  from 2022’s level (62%), exemplifying continued focus on  optimization of  manufacturing and fulfillment costs. Gross margin in  dollars increased  by 76% YoY to $6.4 million (up from $3.6 million in  2022) on the back of  stronger order volumes.   

The  financial results for 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness and  ROI of the  Company’s revamped advertising and promotions approach,  which includes  expanded spending on social media platforms and further  spending on  developing affiliate relationships to promote Aires’  products. During  the year, advertising and promotion spend increased by  only $1.3 million  YoY compared to an annual YoY increase in order  volume that was 3.4x  greater ($4.6 million).   

Marketing  expenses remained relatively stable with a modest 8% YoY  increase to  $2.1 million. The expenses are based on contracts with a  number of  marketing agencies that provide services based on a fee as  opposed to  commissions. As a result, marketing expenses are not  expected to  increase in the same proportion to sales.   

Overhead  costs for the year remained flat at $1.9 million. Largely  non-recurring  legal and professional fees increased mainly related to  an increased  use of legal firms during the year for capital raising  events and  restructuring activities. In contrast, the Company  diligently drove down  office and general costs by 5% and consulting and  payroll expenses by  7%, demonstrating our commitment to efficiency and  to creating value for  Aires shareholders.   

American  Aires Chief Financial Officer, Vitaliy Savitsky,  commented: ""American  Aires is a young high-growth company, so a lot of  my focus has been on  disciplining growth, measuring effectiveness of ad  spend, and reducing  costs. That strategy paid off tremendously in 2023  with its difficult  year in the capital markets. Instead of losing  ground, we focused on  hitting adjusted EBITDA profitability and on  growing sustainably. I’m  very excited about scaling up the business in  existing markets and  expanding internationally in 2024 and beyond with  this disciplined  approach. That’s our strategy and vision for further  strengthening our  industry leader status and delivering more  shareholder value.”

1102,Ok. So here is my take on inflation. ,"During covid and after Covid people have learnt to spend on necessities, because most people are “out of work” and living on stimulus or they didn’t have to pay rent which reduces their spending to necessities ONLY

Fed probably can’t see this. 

Now, everyone wants to work to improve their life therefore unemployment rate drastically decreased which is a good thing, but that didn’t change the fact people are still trying to spend on necessities only to regain their feet for better future. (At least that’s how majorities would think)

Fed probably failed to see this too.

Okay! Here comes the increase rate hike for 2 years to 5.25-5.5%. What happens is companies/corporations have to spend more to produce the same stuff and they ain’t absorbing the costs, who is? The freaking consumers. 

Fed sees this, they are so short sighted, this is all they saw.

Now consumers are forced to spend on necessities at higher price and reduced the amount consumed. Let say you have 2 toasts for breakfast now you can only afford 1. 
Yes this reduced inflation a bit but that’s at the cost of citizen’s health and well being. 


Now here comes the part:

Inflation can’t go down because of high interest rate. Sounds ridiculous? Hear me out. 
Let’s amplify the number so people can see this in a much clearer picture. 
If today increase rate goes up 100% which would make necessities go up 100% as well. This would inflate the price of good and services which cause cpi looks like an over-inflated even with 100% interest rate hike. Unless you tell me people just stop living then that would reduce inflation. 

Let’s get back to the numbers, 5.5% interest hike for past 2 years and expect to see 5.5% cpi is the most logical number, yet we are seeing 2.8%-3.5% that means there are people giving up a load of necessities spending already. 

The logical way would be increase supply. Yes gov has been locking production levels and hasn’t increase them and expect people to not spend more on necessities? Gtfo 

Instead of counting on people spend less, they are better off controlling inflation with production levels and interest rate should be used only as minor adjustments. 

Now fed is just going to keep interest rate the way it is for longer and expect people to spend less. It’s like locking up 100 people and provide only 50 people worth of meal. Some are going to get hurt or worse. Fed is waiting for that happen before rate cut.

1108,Technology OpEd Writings by Major Publications Regarding the Semiconductor Space are Fascinatingly Misleading and Profoundly Ignorant,"For over a year now, there have been technical opinion articles in the main-stream media that have been packed with false information that are so misunderstood by the writer the information comes off as misleading.

Brace for the upcoming Nvidia earnings season because I've noticed that this misinformation peak takes it's full form around this time.

On one hand I am thankful because everytime the misinformation and scare tactics succeed in taking the stock down I simple buy more.

Someone gave a great comment saying, ""Chips and dip taste mmmmmm"". Agreed. If I can find more money to put into Nvidia I love doing it. And when there is any over reaction that is unfounded with any real technical information I will continue to do so.

I'm not saying the stock can't go down but don't present the information like what we're witnessing isn't what our eyes are seeing.

Here are some examples just lately for this go-round.

**Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez** from Fortune magazine says these ridiculous things in his article that you can google because this post won't with too many links because they get auto rejected.

>**Google is building its own AI chips—and it’s a warning shot at Nvidia and Intel**  
Google announced a proprietary chip Tuesday t**hat could help the company cut back its reliance on heavyweight chipmakers and gain a foothold in the increasingly competitive AI race**.  
The new chip, dubbed **Axion**, **will help handle the massive amount of data used by AI applications**, Google said in a Tuesday statement. It’s designed to be grouped into clusters of thousands of chips to improve performance, the *Wall Street Journal* reported.

Here's the thing, that [Google article](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu) that Marco is referencing NEVER says such a thing. Google never makes that claim. In fact, what Google was actually saying is that they are competing with Intel's x86 (x86 is dead) chip architecture with building their own ARM based chips.

Here's the actual google article.

>Today, we are thrilled to announce the latest incarnation of this work: Google Axion Processors, our **first custom Arm®-based CPUs designed for the data center**. Axion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be available to Google Cloud customers later this year.  
...  
Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data analytics engines, media processing, **CPU-based AI training** and inferencing, and more. 

In the entire Google cloud article they only mention AI a single time. And it clear as day that this is not something \[taking on Nvidia\]. Lol who's using CPU based AI training?

In fact, an actual Google employee/interviewee to the Wall Street Journal goes out of their way to explain that we are not competing with Nvidia.

>Customers of the Alphabet subsidiary will be able to access Axion through Google’s cloud business later this year, but will not be able to buy them directly, according to the \*Journal\*. The company’s vice president overseeing proprietary chips, **Amin Vahdat**, **told the outlet that it wants to take a different approach.**  
“Becoming a great hardware company is very different from becoming a great cloud company or a great organizer of the world’s information,” Vahdat said.  
By not selling directly to customers, Google is avoiding direct competition with its longtime partners—and dominant chipmakers—Intel and Nvidia. Instead, Vahdat said, the company sees its entry into the chip market as a positive for everyone in the industry.

Here's another article, just a few hours later from the first, from Fortune that attempts to do the exact same thing. And this is worse than Marco's article.

>**Meta and Google announce new in-house AI chips, creating a “trillion-dollar question” for Nvidia**  
Meta just announced it’s pushing further into the AI chip race, coming right on the heels of Google’s own announcement of its Axion AI chip. **Both companies are touting their new semiconductor models as key for the development of their AI platforms, and as alternatives to the** **Nvidia** **chips they—and the rest of the tech industry—have been relying on to power AI data centers.**

After reading that tile and initial paragraph one would walk away with thinking there is some grand competition ready to wipe out Nvidia at any moment.

I already explained to you Google's new Axion chip.

Here's Meta's new accelerator chip.

I know writers and editors from Fortune aren't idiots. I know they saw Jensen's rock concert the other week. I know they saw SoraVideo generation form Open AI. Why are they writing these articles to just send misinformation into the ether and pollute, cloud, and mislead the general public. I expect this from lesser folk but I do not expect this from Fortune.

1111,Monday War Watchlist (Iran probably shorted the market lol): Looking at $VTGN + $KSUM if there is a fire sale,"Good morning everyone! With Iran launching more than 300 cruise and ballistic missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend, most people are expecting a sea of red tomorrow in the stock market. However, Israel stated minimal damage, and Iran said, ""The matter can be deemed concluded. ""However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!""

Looking at the bright side(very slim, but still there), this conflict could potentially be put to rest rather quickly. Israel has yet to announce any retaliation, so hopefully, after a quick scare in the market early next week, I can get these two stocks on sale.

The first stock is $VTGN. This company primarily focuses on transforming the treatment landscape for individuals living with anxiety, depression, and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Fundamentally, this company looks good. We have a smaller float, sitting at 24M. Also, the Stock price is currently sitting above the MA 20,50 & 200 day, showing signs of strength. Here is the chart I am looking at. The 200 SMA and the trendline are strong support levels, so if the price heads close to these levels, there might be a significant risk to reward setups for a solid trade. I will be monitoring this stock all week!

Next up is for my Canadian investors! $KSUM specializes in nurturing developing startups and seasoned ventures, offering vital financial and strategic counsel to enable their success within the ever-evolving AI landscape. AI is not going anywhere. People will always want to implement AI into their business, but the barrier to entry can be difficult for companies with little to no AI experience or knowledge. This is where $KSUM comes in, and they offer solutions that are sought after by thousands of startups. If you have access to buy this stock please do more research and look into their products some more! Here is some of their most recent news:

* Alset has forged partnerships with Nvidia Hardware suppliers, securing enticing pricing at a 30% discount and promising delivery in less than three months. This is a remarkable improvement compared to the industry average of 9 months.
* Acquired data center space and power capacity from a top-tier national provider, enabling seamless hosting upon machinery delivery. Their goal is to offer enterprise clients 700,000 hours of computing power for lease.

1121,"Welcome to The Correction… 4-15-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

It would appear that the “black swan” we have all been waiting for to kill this bull run is indeed the threat of WW3. While really no escalations further occurred this weekend to fuel this sell off we of course still have the tensions and the unknown.

Last night and really into this morning one would not have expected a 110+ pt drop on ES and nearly 500pt drop on Nq today (from high to low)… however, that is exactly what we got now. This is officially the correction of 5-10% we have all been waiting for. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/05jdg4zl9puc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e62d9217e47ad5670d44db054041d06f6668aac2

In general, a market CORRECTION (which remember is healthy in all bull markets) is generally 5-10%. To get to the 5% mark we are looking for about 498.36 (right above 100ema)… to get to the 7.5% drop that takes us to 485 and to see a full 10% that actually takes us likely just below our daily 200ema support near 472. 

&#x200B;

Similarly taking a look at QQQ here for 5% we will be just above 100ema support near 427. To see 7.5% that takes us to 415.7 area and a full 10% correction takes us right to the 200ema support of 404.5 area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4khga1rm9puc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1029f2add0681cc964fc073ab990d968c50c497f

We have JPOW scheduled to speak tomorrow at 115pm other than that we do not have anything major on the agenda. 

Friendly reminder- while this is likely our correction… like bull markets it is very rarely straight up and it is very rarely straight down… don’t get burnt full porting puts.

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xf5t1u2n9puc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4535dc7f592279b28a3a3103a905a0056ce92a8

Taking a look at SPY here we continue to see daily sellers flood into the market here. We officially not only broke through the major range support/ demand area of 508.05-513.45 but we also officially for the first time since November 2nd 2023 have closed a daily candle below the Daily 50ema. 

The daily 50ema is a major pivot point in markets… in general usually it will be backtest (much like the 20ema was today) before it officially is lost. This breaking of 50ema support most certainly should and will lead to a correction to the 100ema which sits near 492.44 right now. 

For SPY we technically are still in our major macro bull channel that we have been in for almost 6 months now. Bulls need to defend 501.25 tomorrow in order to hold that level. 

If the bears break through that support then again our next major target is demand near 495.38 and daily 100ema support. 

Bulls will now not be in control until we close OVER daily 8, 20 and 50ema resistance again. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 518.01  
 Demand- 495.38 -> 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4l81bfn9puc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a8a8d88a3b83a5f6a58a48a619b44d9ee8fd788

Much like SPY we have stronger daily sellers (though at open we actually were weakened sellers). We are now hard rejecting the daily 8/20ema resistance and closing well below the daily 50ema support. 

Here on ES our demand/ support area was 5186-5202 which we did close below on Friday. Our next major demand/ support area is 5072-5114. IF this area is broke we could see the more major sell off down to 4961-4989 triple demand and support near the daily 100ema. This support is from middle of February 2024. 

Bulls will need to retake the 8, 20 and 50ema near 5200-5217 in order to be in control. Bulls also need to defend channel support at 5055 tomorrow. 

Bears main target form here is 5051 supply and then the daily 100ema near 4961-4989. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5051 -> 5243  
 Demand- 5072 -> 5091 -> 5114 -> 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

Now taking a look at QQQ here we also went back to stronger daily sellers (the last two days has been buyers). We also are officially closing below the daily 50ema support today. Like I said I do expect a backtest of this now resistance before we head down to the daily 100ema support near 421.25 though. 

The range support of 433.84-436.95 that bulls have been defending officially broke today. Our next major demand/ support levels to watch are 424.49 and 416.96. 

Bulls will need to retake the daily 8, 20 and 50ema resistance near 438.7-440 to be back in control. 

Bears need to now seek out the daily 100ema support near that 424.49 demand area. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.36  
 Demand- 416.96 -> 424.49 -> 433.84 -> 435.33 -> 436.95

Looking at NQ here we also are of course breaking through our major range/ support area. However, we do have one last support here at 17857 which is holding us up before we see a more major sell off to the next supports at 17579 and 17264. 

Daily sellers have once again returned and we are now nearing daily extreme bear momentum on NQ and ES. The daily bull channel support line that dates back 6 months is officially broken now. 

Bulls need to retake 8, 20 and 50ema resistance near 18210-18266 in order to be back in control. 

Bears targets will now be to sell down to the daily 100ema support near 17448. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS   
 Supply- 18489  
 Demand- 17264 -> 17579 -> 17857 -> 17980 -> 18052

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hqtg14no9puc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6c77f39408aba155e02db606b2fe65d22474ff3

The VIX this morning started out very mild and tamed and actually was down about 5% at one point. However, we found a major bounce (there was some more media/ news about Israel/ Iran released that coordinated perfectly with it. 

The VIX is not only approaching its next major resistance area of 20.67-21.73 but it is also approaching a major resistance and bear trend line that is near 2 years long. This resistance line uses September 2022 and March 2023 peaks to form its resistance line. A break of this trend line could mean that more than just a correction is coming. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

After having a rough day Friday one thing I like to do is to size down. I wanted to get my confidence back today and take some solid plays. I sized back down to just one contract. 

I also decided I was doing too much too fast. Instead of trying to play numerous accounts at once (which again is good when its good and bad when its bad)… I decided to just trade each account one at a time… 

I ended up on the early morning drop finishing passing my EVAL from Friday and then passed another eval to replace my lost MFFU Accounts. I then took a really nice long around 1130am on the first support bounce. I closed this play super early as it was leading into the bond auction and I did not want to get wicked out (have gotten hit hard on auctions too many times). I ended up closing before we saw almost 10-15pts of upside. 

I perfectly timed a short play off the rejection at 1215pm today. I entered and took 4 pts. I again was happy to take a nice win and was not looking to be a hero today. This ended up dumping almost 20-25 pts instantly after I closed. 

Again there are days when you win and win big and there are days when you win small and could have been greedy. Friday one of the main things that wrecked me was that I was uber greedy. I was not going to make that mistake today again. 

In the end I thought about it and for my APEX PA I have I need 5 more trading days (green or red) and then I will stop trading that account until May 1st when I can request a payout. 

My MFFU accounts I just need small consistent wins too. I am very happy with today and if I can do this every day there is nothing wrong with that… I will likely trade this week sized down on 1 con each just to keep my confidence up and I also recognize (and thought about it this weekend) that when the VIX is nearing the 20s the volatility is going to be incredibly high. There will certainly be times when we see major wins point wise however, with the volatility brings the potential for major reversals too that can hit your stop loss quickly. I am happy to be sized down for now.

1122,TODAY: Abitibi Metals Corp. (AMQ.c) Expands Drill Program at B26 Polymetallic/Copper Deposit,"Today, Abitibi Metals Corp. (Ticker: AMQ.c or AMQFF for US investors) announced its expansion of its maiden drill program at its B26 Polymetallic Deposit to 13,500m. 

AMQ's decision to amplify the drill program stems from a series of positive developments, including the acquisition of visual evidence hinting at abundant mineralization. 

The B26 Polymetallic Deposit, nestled within the renowned Abitibi Greenstone Belt, spans 66 claims across 3,328 hectares, with high potential for copper, zinc, gold, and silver extraction and a strike length of 1 kilometer and a depth of 0.8 kilometers.

*Processing img ku9hu5u3jquc1...*

The project has an indicated resource of 6.97 million tonnes at 2.94% CuEq and inferred resources totaling 4.41 million tonnes at 2.97%.

Historical intercepts, including 2.32% CuEq over 89.5 metres, 3.05% CuEq over 48.1 metres, and 8.95% CuEq over 11.5 metres, provide a foundation of confidence in the deposit's potential. 

Moreover, recent findings by Abitibi further enrich this narrative, with highlights such as 6.3% CuEq over 10.6 metres and 11.4% CuEq over 10.6 metres. 

Moreover, B26 is only 7km away from the historical Selbaie Mine, a similar Polymetallic Copper Deposit which had a historical resource of 56.9 Mt @ 0.87% Cu, 1.85% Zn, 0.55 g/t Au and 39 g/t Ag.

As the drill program at B26 advances, industry anticipation heightens. Over 40 holes at B26 are currently awaiting assay results, giving the potential for substantial revelations about the deposit's composition and value. 

Considering that AMQ is also currently drilling at its high-grade Beschefer Gold Project, several potential catalysts for AMQ are expected in the coming weeks and months.

1124,"Spatial Computing become a hot topic, more enterprises start their they out in this field(NASDAQ: WIMI)"," 

Apple (AAPL) has been committed to providing innovative products and services to companies for decades. Now, with the launch of Apple Vision Pro, and the advent of this representative consumer space computing product, the concept of “Spatial computing” is really introduced to the public and rapidly popularized.

**Spatial computing will help thousands of industries**

At present, the application design in Vision Pro attaches great importance to user experience and immersion. For example, it supports the placement of virtual objects or information in the space, providing users with the function of interacting with the real world, such as measuring the distance and watching the scenery outside the window, and greatly enhancing the user’s spatial experience.

In addition, there are more tools and efficiency applications in Vision Pro, with game applications accounting for only about 12%, reflecting the product positioning of Vision Pro “Spatial computing devices”, which is significantly different from other XR devices that focus on entertainment games.

Spatial computing Increase the calculation dimension, the content becomes more three-dimensional, almost 100% of the information. Spatial computing Will become the next generation of computing methods, completely change the traditional information presentation and interaction paradigm, has become a general consensus in the industry.

At the same time, the explosion and rapid development of AIGC this year also began to solve the problem of rapid production and creation of digital content, realizing the closed loop in the Spatial computing field, and the full-stack link of XR was opened up. The shift in XR devices also to the definition of “Spatial computing platform” will further accelerate growth in areas such as XR, digital twin and meta-universe.

Spatial computing Integrating digital content with the physical world provides an infinite canvas that allows companies to reshape their workspace and improve their daily work efficiency. Developers have built applications for Vision Pro in a wide variety of enterprise categories, ranging from business productivity and product design to immersive training and mentoring wor.

As Nvidia (NVDA) says, ” Industries around the world are scrambling to build digital twins of products, facilities, and processes to better test and optimize design before building in the physical world. Companies can now combine the powerful capabilities and capabilities of Apple Vision Pro and the physical precision rendering of OpenUSD content with Nvidia-accelerated computing to power the next generation of immersive digital experiences.

**WiMi competes for the Spatial computing era**

After personal computing and mobile computing, the tech world seems to be accelerating into a new revolution in the computing paradigm. It is understood that as a professional provider of technology innovation solutions, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), has invested a lot of time and energy in artificial intelligence and meta-universe, committed to using scientific and technological innovation, transforming various cutting-edge technologies to provide users with better experience, and promoting the development of the whole industry.

It should be noted that the entry of WiMi Hologram Cloud is not only the maturity of the industrial chain, but also to seize the entrance of the Spatial computing era. Spatial computing Is “redefine” the core competitiveness of science and technology enterprises, WiMi Hologram Cloud will integrate generative AI + AR ability, build industrial innovation and economic growth engine, provide AR games, 3D movies and the space video, even support AI + AR office more screen display video conference, create new markets for industrial economy, new products and new services provides the imagination and possibility.

As the new wave surges, WiMi Hologram Cloud continues to challenge itself. Today, WiMi Hologram Cloud is based on cutting-edge Spatial computing technology to provide users with a more technological and immersive virtual exploration experience. In the future, WiMi Hologram Cloud will continue to invest in cutting-edge fields such as motion capture and Spatial computing, bring more intelligent and advanced “virtual” services to the majority of users, provide a more immersive interactive way, and contribute its own strength to the development of the Spatial computing era.

**To sum up**

Spatial computing Is a technology used to capture, process and interact with 3D data in real time. Through spatial digital twinning and real-time computing, people can produce an immersive interactive experience such as perception and feedback. Enterprises have a huge opportunity to reimagine the possibility of using Apple Vision Pro in their future work and life. Spatial computing As the definition of the new era, it must contain huge business opportunities, rapid layout, power application scenarios and ecology, in order to jump ahead of most people. In short, with Apple, a tech giant, there is reason to believe that Spatial computing will revolutionize all industries around the world.",1713249290,823974,Mediocre-Amphibiam,t2_nv370l3d6,37aad7eef76f894f3110299f46336aefb4a234b6d39fb465630e08ea5fc6735a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1c59bdq/spatial_computing_become_a_hot_topic_more/

My thoughts heading into today was that we would likely find support and attempt to get back to the daily 50ema resistance. We, however, found ourselves in a more tight range day and did not quite get to my ultimate target today. 

Overall tomorrow we should look for a to the daily 50ema resistance near 508.05 demand. This is going to become our major pivot point. If the bulls close back over 508.05 then we could look for a backtest of the daily 20ema resistance which now sits near 514.2. This would also be a backtest of the previous demand/ support which is now resistance. 

If bulls close over 514.2 (daily 20ema) then I would begin to target a move to 518.01-523.45 triple supply/ resistance. 

If we get the rejection off the daily 50ema like I am anticipating then our target will be a breakdown to 502 supply and eventually the daily 100ema near 495.38 demand. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 502 -> 518.01  
 Demand- 495.38 -> 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

Much like SPY here on ES we had stronger daily sellers and we did not get a new daily demand. 

The bulls came close to backtesting the daily 50ema resistance of 5133 but did not officially get there today. We continue to defend and hold onto this 5072-5091 support area. This is critical for the bulls to defend. 

Bulls will look to move back to the daily 20ema resistance near 5186-5202. A closure over that brings a bigger breakout to 5243-5309 triple supply. 

Bears need to reject here off the daily 50ema and look for a closure under 5072. That closure would likely bring a bigger breakdown to 4961-4989 triple demand/ support near the 100ema.

Now on QQQ we did not see sellers weaken either. We also attempted to get back to the daily 50ema and just could not quite get there. Previously demand/ support of 433.84-436.95 is now holding nicely as resistance. 

Bulls need to close minimally over 436.95 to then target a bigger breakout to the daily 20ema resistance of 439.19.

Ideally the bears need to continue to defend this triple demand which was support and is now resistance. IF they can do that and close below 430 we should be looking for a move back to 424.49 demand near the 100ema.

Here on NQ we did not get a new daily demand and daily sellers did not weaken. However, this doji double bottom here certainly could be a temporary bottom for a run up higher tomorrow. 

The support level of 17857 that I mentioned yesterday continues today to hold as critical support and continues to hold this up. If the bears close under that level then our bigger downside target and move likely will be to 17579 demand just over the daily 100ema. 

Bulls need to still breakout and close over the daily 50ema resistance of 18027 to then target a breakout over previous support/ demand which is now resistance from 17980-18072.

The VIX was all over the place today, however, despite the new recent high and major rejection we surprisingly did not get a new supply today. 

20.67-21.73 remains to be critical upside levels. 

To the downside we will look for support near 15.81-16.45.

I liked how yesterday went with just spreading the wealth around… essentially one trade per account a day is the goal… 

I ended up taking a nice long this morning for just under 5 pts. From there I was basically sitting cash all day… we were stuck in a such a clear range all day today that I didn’t find anything to trade. The only plays I found too I didn’t get filled before instant 5+ pt pumps. 

EOD when we finally broke our intraday range I attempted to go long twice only to get stopped out twice. We did not have the explosiveness I expected after breaking our range. 

Overall I prefer to trade like this where basically 1 small loss in three accounts and 1 small green win in the other accounts. Its nice to spread the PnL around. Even if that means on super green days each account only receives a small boost.

1132,URANIUM: Tisdale Clean Energy (TCEC.c) Strengthens Partnership with Skyharbour Resources by Appointing their CEO to the Board Today,"Today, Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. (Ticker: TCEC.c or TCEFF for US investors) announced that it has appointed Jordan Trimble to its Advisory Board. Trimble, the President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources, brings extensive experience in the uranium sector, particularly in the Athabasca Basin where TCEC operates.

Trimble's impressive track record includes growing Skyharbour from a $2 million to a $90 million market cap company.

His role will involve providing valuable insights as TCEC develops its South Falcon East project. This project, where Skyharbour is a partner, holds significant uranium resources with potential for further expansion. 

Full Press Release: https://www.tisdalecleanenergy.com/20240416--tisdale-clean-energy-appoints-jordan-trimble-to--advisory-board

TCEC recently announced the completion of the initial two drill holes at the South Falcon East Project. Positioned just outside the renowned uranium-rich Athabasca Basin and approximately 50 km east of the Key Lake uranium mill and former mine, the project holds significant strategic value.

https://preview.redd.it/m1c1jyldoxuc1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8b3ec09b72cd7aea6bdb32ebff12686d1b9045

With a historical mineral resource estimate of 6.9 Mlbs U3O8 inferred, indicating promising exploration opportunities, the 2024 program's primary objective is to validate existing mineralization through two phases of drilling totaling up to 1500m. Future drill programs will aim to expand the Fraser Lake B deposit and explore other high-priority targets within the South Falcon East domain.

The first phase concluded with 442m drilled across the initial two boreholes. The initial hole intersected multiple uranium mineralization zones over 13.5m, with notable findings including 0.03% eU3O8 over 4.1 m, suggesting continuity of mineralization. The second hole aimed to extend mineralization from a historical hole and discovered several mineralized zones below 132m, including 0.02% U3O8 over 1.3 m, with 0.05% eU3O8 over 0.1m.

Samples from the mineralized intervals within the drill core have been collected and sent for analysis. The successful drilling confirms the presence of mineralized pegmatites and pelitic paragneiss within the deposit and project area, setting the stage for further exploration. 

With drilling set to resume later this spring, Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. is positioned to uncover additional mineralization potential within the South Falcon East Project.

1137,Best Risk-to Reward Set Up This Week: $ONEI Testing its 2024 Trendline,"Good morning, everyone! I hope your trading has been going well so far this week! I was waiting for this correction at the beginning of this week, and I got exactly what I was looking for with $ONEI. With its current price just above the trendline and still strong fundamentals with its partnership with Microsoft, the likelihood of it breaking both support levels is pretty slim. Below is exactly what I am looking at. Let's make some bread!  
**Strategy**: Long Position

**Entry Target**: A buy entry would be as close to the trend line as possible, slightly above $0.70, which is reinforced by the 200-day moving average. This dual support region could act as a springboard for price appreciation.

**Stop-Loss**: A tight stop-loss could be placed just below the trend line and 200-day moving average, around $0.65, to minimize risk. This assumes the 200-day moving average is currently at $0.5024 and rising, and the trend line is also ascending, as indicated.

**Exit Target**: The profit target can be set by measuring the distance from the trend line near the recent peak around $1.10. This setup provides a more than 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio, with potential to adjust the targets if the price shows strong bullish momentum.

1153,Getting in on Gladiator Metals $GDTRF before a breakout,"Right now I am turning to the potential breakout of the symmetrical triangle $GDTRF has been in since its inception. There have been multiple fakeouts over the last few months, but the volume has been relatively high in 2024. With more and more attention on this stock and a move to be made within the next month, I want to get in before the big move to capitalize.

**Breakout Target: .40 for 40% gains**

The most likely scenario is getting in before the news and then selling once a positive catalyst hits. Since this stock has been consolidating for over a year, this stock could shoot up pretty high. .40 might even be pretty conservative. This is a pretty simple “buy the rumor and sell the news” strategy so be on the lookout for press releases or statements from the CEO

You can take profits before it is totally up to your discretion. A symmetrical triangle has the ability to break either way (like every pattern, really), so make sure to implement a stop loss as well. Risk management is the best way to maintain longevity in the stock market, so make sure to always have a stop loss. Mental stop losses are good, too, but it requires you to monitor this stock constantly.

1159,"SPY Closes its 5th Red Day in a Row… 4-18-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

For the last two days we have been looking for a bounce and the bears have done an impressive job of preventing that bounce. Today honestly was a close as we have been to a convincing recovery/ relief bounce over the last week. The morning squeeze was strong and impressive. However, bears ended up not only rejecting the squeeze but they managed to break us down from green to red and seek out a lower beneath yesterdays low. 

With SPY officially closing out its 5th red day in a row this is the first time that we are seeing a move like that in the markets since October 2023. IF we were to get an impressive 6th red day tomorrow that would mark the first time we have seen that since September 2022 when SPY fell 6 days and 7.16% over that time period. 

Event wise we have Netflix reporting after the bell which could certainly provide a boost one way or another tonight. We do not have any major data or events that I can see on the calendar for tomorrow right now. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8py3mtmepavc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a1531bb7f11332fa2d5d664078c81cd3e05cb7

This morning on SPY, and QQQ for that matter, we were set up to get a new daily demand and support. We for the second day in a row also saw sellers weaken overnight and through the morning only to lead to stronger sellers coming in by EOD to take the price lower. Right now bears remain in strong control and realistically they are in control until bulls retake the 50ema resistance near 506.89.

The daily 8ema is officially under the 50ema for the first time since November 2023. In general an 8/50ema cross under generally leads to a true correction of significant size. If we see the 20ema cross under the 50ema I would fully expect a daily 200ema test at some point before recovery. 

Next major demand and support to watch is 495.38. From there if bears break under that its daily 100ema support near 493.

Major resistance for bulls now sits from 507-512.45. This is 6 previous demands (supports) that are now resistance along with the daily 8, 20 and 50ema. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 518.01  
 Demand- 482.88 -> 495.38 -> 508.05

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x0ov353fpavc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ee864779744cbe70f7abf7ae7e2ebfba61ce49

Similarly here on ES we saw sellers weaken overnight and led to a decently strong overnight move. We, however, post squeeze saw daily sellers once again come in stronger to make a new recent low and impressively backtest and reject our white bear channel. 

This white bear channel is our more extreme sell off channel. The resistance sits at 5072 for tomorrow and gives us a support target of 4961-4989.

With this 5072-5114 previous demand/ support rejecting and holding as resistance today I do fully expect that we could see a major breakdown to the 100ema. 

Bulls will not be back in control until we retake the daily 8/ 50ema resistance near 5130. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5243  
 Demand- 4961 -> 4974 -> 4989 -> 5072

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x32wr7hfpavc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=10381e2e4474f6d70809092abf35364380938fc8

Tech is once again our weakest of them all and continues to lead us lower. The bears came very close with stronger sellers and extreme bear momentum to touching the daily 100ema support of 421.59 but fell just short today of accomplishing that. 

424.49 currently is our major support and pivot point. Underneath that support and we likely will see a break of the 100ema (which should allow ES/SPY to touch its 100ema) and would give 406.1-416.96 as our downside targets. Historically in drops/ corrections like this we will see big tech (QQQ/ NQ) be far more dramatic in the correction compared to Spy/ ES. 

Bulls will only be in control if they retake 433.84-436.95 triple demand which is now resistance. 

QQQ DAILY LEVLES  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 445.36  
 Demand- 406.1 -> 416.96 -> 424.49 -> 433.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ddk4cewfpavc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f958a9002278bf029b2218a0914e42a4dbc7aa2f

Similarly to QQQs 424.49 we have 17579 on NQ which is our pivot point. Below this level and we start to target the 100ema support and then ideally 17264 demand. However, if this is a true correction and ES/SPY touches it 100ema support we likely will see NQ flush lower to the daily demand of 16858. 

We continue to see stronger sellers and extreme bear momentum here on NQ. We never quite saw daily sellers weaken on NQ like we did on SPY which clearly shows the level of weakness here on tech compared to SPY/ ES. 

Bulls need to retake 17857 first before retaking critical 17980-18072 to be back in control. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY  
 Supply- 17133 -> 18489  
 Demand- 17264 -> 17579 -> 17857

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/35r0sq9gpavc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7699e59ff51372d02b6645458dcf7ca8e6a4a481

A bit of a surprising day here on the VIX once again. We once again have a red day in the markets while we are also seeing a red day on the VIX. 

My target for today on the VIX was to backtest daily 8ema support of 17.32 and that is exactly what we got. With this hard bounce off daily 8ema support on the VIX we very well could see a push over today supply of 18.25 and start a move upwards towards 20.67-21.73 which would certainly bring a 6th red day in the market. 

The VIX continues to also trend in an upward yellow bull channel. Realistically until that channel support breaks we are still in the correction and should not be long biased. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5qxn6sogpavc1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a6497bd82ea1220db5d2c0d4ae364b0edbcc0d

Truthfully today was a tough day to trade for me. I was bullish the last three days for a bounce and the overnight technicals on ES made me bullish too. However, of course we had that massive morning dump which set up a bit more choppy move. I recognized the morning squeeze based on the level and dramatics of the buying we had which made me sit side lines. 

I did patiently wait to take a short which I was just about 2 pts too early on as I got stopped out at HOD before the inevitable dump came. I ended up getting a quick short that I accidentally took in the wrong account so I set a very quick BE stop. I took another short in my other account (the correct one) to recover the morning loss and break that account even. 

I only traded two of my four accounts today as I honestly just could not find anything that I liked to trade today. These days where option squeezes cause such funky moves are very difficult for me to trade well so I try to recognize them early and sit cash if I can. 

Looking forward to tomorrow and hoping with the bit more choppy day today (much like Tuesday) that tomorrow gives us a nice tradable trend. Tomorrow, however, is OPEX day so I will tread lightly there.

I am not forcing anyone to use it!

I used a capital of 2400$ and in a day I earned about 300$ in 24h of work. I would not say that the work is the most fun, but with such a spread why not.

So, the method itself (I'll simplify it a bit)

In short, we will earn 0.5% for each transaction to the IOST network. For this we will use their coin IOST.

**Steps**:

1. Buy a IOST coin
2. Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased IOST
3. Select Deposit and copy MEMO (It's important to specify every time
4. Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: IOST
* Adress: iostcold
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

Choose a small amount of coins for the test!

And after 5-10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only **+0.5% (in coins)**

If anyone has been helped, you can throw me a couple $ for coffee)

1170,Discussing the Oil Industry and the Impact of $PDGO," Hey everyone,

I wanted to spark a discussion about the oil industry and how it intersects with the recent developments surrounding $PDGO. With the volatility in oil prices and the emergence of $PDGO as a significant player in the market, there's a lot to unpack here.

Firstly, let's talk about the oil industry. We all know it's a complex ecosystem influenced by various factors such as geopolitical tensions, supply and demand dynamics, and environmental concerns. The fluctuating oil prices have a ripple effect across global economies, impacting everything from consumer spending to corporate profits.

Now, enter $PDGO. This company has been making headlines with its innovative approaches to oil exploration and production. From leveraging advanced technologies to optimizing operational efficiency, $PDGO seems poised to disrupt traditional norms within the industry.

But what does this mean for the broader oil market? Some argue that $PDGO's entry could introduce much-needed competition, driving down prices and incentivizing other players to innovate. On the flip side, there are concerns about overreliance on new, unproven technologies and the potential environmental implications of aggressive oil extraction practices.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you see $PDGO as a positive force for innovation in the oil industry, or do you have reservations about its impact? How do you think its presence will shape the future of oil exploration and production?

1171,Exploring the Potential of Hydrogen Cars and the Role of $RONN,"Hey everyone,

I've been intrigued by the growing buzz around hydrogen cars and the recent developments surrounding $RONN. Let's dive into this fascinating topic and see what insights we can uncover.

Hydrogen cars have long been hailed as a promising alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, offering zero-emission transportation with the potential for greater efficiency and sustainability. Unlike electric vehicles that rely on batteries, hydrogen cars generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct.

Enter $RONN. This company has been making waves with its ambitious vision for the future of transportation, particularly in the realm of hydrogen-powered vehicles. With advancements in hydrogen fuel cell technology and infrastructure, $RONN aims to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen cars and pave the way for a greener, more sustainable automotive industry.

But what sets hydrogen cars apart, and how does $RONN fit into the equation? For starters, hydrogen cars offer several advantages over traditional gasoline and even electric vehicles. They boast longer driving ranges and shorter refueling times, addressing two major concerns often associated with electric cars: range anxiety and charging infrastructure.

Moreover, hydrogen cars produce no harmful emissions, making them an attractive option for eco-conscious consumers and policymakers alike. As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, hydrogen cars could play a pivotal role in transitioning towards a low-carbon transportation system.

Now, let's talk about $RONN's role in this landscape. As a company focused on advancing hydrogen fuel cell technology, $RONN is at the forefront of innovation in the automotive industry. Through strategic partnerships and groundbreaking research, $RONN is driving progress towards a future where hydrogen cars are not just a niche novelty but a mainstream reality.

But challenges remain. Despite the promise of hydrogen cars, widespread adoption faces hurdles such as high production costs, limited refueling infrastructure, and the need for sustainable hydrogen production methods. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from industry stakeholders, governments, and consumers alike.

So, what do you think about hydrogen cars and the role of $RONN in shaping their future? Are you excited about the potential of hydrogen-powered vehicles, or do you have reservations?

1177,"Bears Close a Historical 6th Red Day… 4-19-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures, 10YR Yield, DXY/ US Dollar and Cl/ Oil Futures Weekly Market Analysis","  

After an escalation in the Middle East last night we saw one of the bloodiest overnight moves in future in probably two years. However, we got the Russia/ Ukraine war treatment and were able to completely recover the whole lost before opening. However, this would not be it for the bears… the bears were once again able to drop us to a new even lower low on NQ. 

Tech continues to be the nail in the bulls coffins. 

&#x200B;

We have a pretty light data week ahead next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8c09jpjythvc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e38e40cbc092d331500194b09e0a5b4bb92ba4

We of course continue into earnings season with notable names like Tesla, Meta, MSFT, and Google reporting next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sn0cfqwythvc1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=b716c77afe3d99f42f57b76bffd25f4ec229d154

Not only are we making a historical gap up and then intraday sell off we are seeing a historical 6 red days in a row right now. The last time we saw a move like this was September 2022 during the bear market. 

**SPY WEEKLY**  
 

https://preview.redd.it/120yaf9zthvc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b549d3472ad410f0d6490054ac5bf3b5761f7e4

While this is one of the biggest weekly candles we have seen to the downside (or even upside) on SPY this year we have honestly held onto a very critical support. The weekly 20ema support at LOW at 494 was the line in the sand here. While I do think we could see some more downside here we have a very high probability of finding a weekly double bottom next week to minimally backtest the weekly 8ema near 508. 

There are officially weekly sellers on SPY for the first time since October 2023. 

The bulls next week minimally need to retake the weekly 8ema at 508. If they can close over the weekly 8ema there is a chance we may have found the bottom of the correction. 

If the bears can close under the weekly 20ema next week there is a very high probability that we are going to touch the weekly 50ema support near 467 area before we find the official bottom of this correction. A touch of the weekly 50ema support would be roughly a 10-11% sell off depending on how fast we get there. 

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply 475.46 -> 423.21  
 Demand- 467.96 -> 497.67 -> 509.48

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

Similarly here on ES we have officially found weekly sellers for the first time since October 2023 and barely (despite breaking it at one point overnight) held onto weekly 20ema support near 4995.

This is the most probable spot bulls will attempt to find support and bounce us higher. If the bulls are unable to bounce us here then we again should look for a move down to the supply/ demand levels of 4733-4771. This is also a perfectly correlation with the weekly 50ema support on ES. 

Bulls minimally need to retake weekly 8ema resistance at 5135 to be back in control. 

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4771 -> 5307  
 Demand- 4733 -> 5014 -> 51823

**QQQ WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jz2eq95uhvc1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c295dee9d62b29c794c30df5e56e667bb5a7069

Now as I had said tech as a whole is what is driving this sell off right now. We are seeing a pretty major rotation out of some of the bigger names like NVDA down 9% today. As I mentioned yesterday QQQ/ NQ like to over shoot targets in a more dramatic way than we see on ES/ SPY. Currently QQQ is closing under its weekly 20ema support for the first time since October 2023. 

With the weekly 20ema support breached and closed under our next most natural area of support to target is the weekly 50ema support near 396.72 demand. 

The bulls minimally need to be back over the weekly 20ema resistance of 423 next week. However, to be back in control the bulls must retake the weekly 8ema near 432.8.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 408.58 -> 446.38  
 Demand- 396.72 -> 423.1 -> 428.26 -> 433.85

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

Much like QQQ we have seen not only a breach of the weekly 20ema support but also the demand at 17460 which has been support and ultimate range bottom since January. With this breach of 3+ month long support we are looking at a major opportunity for the bears here to take this lower. 

The bears are going to again target a move to the weekly 50ema support near 16455 demand. 

Bulls need to minimally retake weekly 20ema resistance at 17460 next week. However, once we are back over the weekly 8ema resistance of 17938 we can consider the bulls back in control. 

NQ FUTURES WEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16957 -> 18569  
 Demand- 16455 -> 17460 -> 17718 -> 18054

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hb0tzy16uhvc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=082beff1c602a3805e3333c82c4dc970fe43f634

The VIX had a MAJOR gap up at open due the overnight volatility and fears related to the middle east. However, as you can see despite a major 19% gap up at open… the VIX sold off as things settled down. 

This actually leaves us at a very interesting level here on VIX. I was looking for the bounce off the daily 8ema support today and eventually target of 21.29-21.73. We got that today perfectly. However, because of the price action on the VIX despite a higher move we actually are not getting a new demand/ support today. 

We now have an imbalanced close here on VIX. 

The VIX also broke a major 4 year long resistance line today with this breakout. It also completes the major cup and handle I have been eyeing on the VIX since December 2023. 

**US 10YR YIELD WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpndqhj6uhvc1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=774b91d1a1f92d386e21a3647885ae7f41e5b017

The 10YR continues to be in a major upside trend also here which finally correlates with the downside move we are seeing in market the last week or so. 

The 10YR is looking to make a move back to 4.912% supply which dates back to middle of October 2023. 

**DXY/ US DOLLAR WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1kq28y6uhvc1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=a418ebc8b8df664f90679c7ebea298c9c23ec2d4

DXY also continues to trend in an upwards bull channel. However, we are seeing a more doji like rejection here on DXY. IF this rejection holds and we get a new supply next week we will look for DXY to move back down to 104.29-104.548 support area. 

If DXY continues to break out then our target is 108.938 from September 2023. 

**CL/ US OIL FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l8ncd328uhvc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e2bb31367514cab5f22b967d52fb41df370feb4

After nearly 4 months of upside movement on Oil we are finally seeing our bull channel support broken. This might officially be the top of oil. This might finally be the break that CPI data needs. 

We do need to see weekly 8ema support at 82 break in order to continue lower. A closure under demand of 80.57 next week likely would signal that this is an official top on oil. 

However, if we hard bounce off these weekly EMAs and demands then our upside target will once again be 86.75. 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**

Overall I had a great week this week. I was able to secure some green in all my accounts. 

This morning after the major overnight move I decided that I wanted to take a trade in 3 of my accounts and call it a day. I was able to secure a win in three of those accounts and that was exactly where I called it a day. I am honestly glad I stopped then as we entered some chop. 

Truthfully I feel like my ideal trading time is between 10am and about 1130am. 

I look forward to riding this green momentum into next week and continuing to see upside gains next week. 

I hope everyone has a great weekend and I will see you guys Monday! ",1713557509,824004,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,d58417543ce9251386e229786e95c2b3a258ca7ba8f0c72a5e44b7bb9602b84d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1c86mgt/bears_close_a_historical_6th_red_day_41924_spy_es/

1184,"Who's going first-class first, me or my dog?","*Okay, I saw this story online and had to share. I think this is insanity, but wanna hear others opinions lol*

The world's first jet service for dogs has been announced; however, the airline isn’t cheap.

A one-way ticket will cost you $6k.

**The Breakdown**

[BARK](https://air.bark.co/), the dog toy company that has a very popular treat subscription service called BarkBox, has certainly found its target demographic of very, very spoiled furry companions.

The company is partnering with a jet charter service to give dogs their own first-class flight experience.

Flying pets such as dogs or cats across long distances is often a very challenging and stressful endeavor. Each airline has different policies for pet travel. For example, American Airlines only allows small dogs onboard in small carriers that have to be placed underneath the seat in front of you. Large dogs must be stowed in the cargo space, which has been found to be a very stressful spot for pets due to the loud noise of the engine and separation from the owner.

For United Airlines, pets can fly in the cabin only if there is enough space on the aircraft, and they must be able to fit in a carrier underneath your seat. This means that not all pets are able to fly.

**The Service**

Bark Air attempts to solve this problem with an expensive white glove solution resembling a human’s first-class experience.

The first BARK Air flight will take off on May 23. So far, just two flight routes are available, both from New York’s Westchester County Airport, flying to either London Stansted Airport or Los Angeles’s Van Nuys Airport.

The pets are pampered and treated as first-class VIP passengers. These furry passengers can skip the TSA checkpoints and screenings, instead experiencing a simple check-in process where they are able to meet the other dogs on the flight, and the human passengers are served a meal cooked on board by on-site checks.

While boarding, the BARK Air concierge is on hand to ensure the dogs are socializing and adjusting well to the onboard environment. Each flight undergoes “Dogs Fly First” flight preparations, which include “calming pheromones, music, and researched colors that dogs prefer.” To make the flying experience as enjoyable and easy as possible for the dogs, they are given access to various aid items such as calming treats, noise-canceling ear muffs, and calming jackets. During takeoff and landing, dogs are given a beverage of their choice to help their ears adjust to the cabin pressure and as many treats as they like.

If only regular airlines treated us humans this well!

""...and looking at the end of this period, in your projection, what is the total amount of cash the debtors are projecting to have at the end of March 2025?""  

Witness (Financial Advisor / Restructuring Professional):  
""One billion, two-hundred and fifty-one million dollars.""


🚨 Using this 'under oath' stated amount of cash ($1,251,000,000) and dividing it by the outstanding/set amount of Yellow's common shares (52,128,887)...this implies a future YELLQ stock price of $23.998, suggesting an upside move of 208% from Friday's closing price of $7.80 (which stands as a multi-year high)!  🚀 The all-time low was .43 cents, last July.  Since that point, the company's share price has steadily moved up a whopping 1,714% - surpassing NEARLY ALL publicly traded American stocks over the previous 9 months...let alone on a multi-year basis! 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Advisor's cash flow forecast ""does"" include projected administrative/property/professional/legal/sales/employee costs & fees.  For additional clarity, this projected amount of cash also ""does"" include estimated proceeds from sales of Yellow Corporation's:  (owned) rolling stock, remaining (owned) real estate, remaining (leased) real estate, and forecasted accounts receivable.  Prior to the bankruptcy petition filing in 2023, Yellow was the 5th largest transportation company in North America!

I am not forcing anyone to use it!

I used a capital of 2400$ and in a day I earned about 300$ in 24h of work. I would not say that the work is the most fun, but with such a spread why not.

So, the method itself (I'll simplify it a bit)

In short, we will earn 0.5% for each transaction to the IOST network. For this we will use their coin IOST.

**Steps**:

1. Buy a IOST coin
2. Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased IOST
3. Select Deposit and copy MEMO (It's important to specify every time
4. Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: IOST
* Adress: iostcold
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

Choose a small amount of coins for the test!

And after 5-10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only **+0.5% (in coins)**

If anyone has been helped, you can throw me a couple $ for coffee)

1191,$KSUM at a critical point + $AGBA absolutely flying,"Good morning everyone! I wanted to highlight these two companies price action right now. $AGBA is going nuts right now, up 70% at the time i am writing this, with news of a powerhouse merger. I am also watching $KSUM at it's current level hoping for it to bounce and to continue the uptrend it has been on since. I go into more detail on the price action below!

Since 2024, $KUSM's volume and price has increased significantly. The company has picked up a lot of momentum recently and I do believe that they are going to continue this trend. Right now the price action is lingering right next to its trendline. If the price breaks the trendline AND the 50 SMA, I would believe the trend has reversed. Keep an eye on this!

Next is $AGBA. I am going to link the recent catalyst, but before this pump the stock had been pretty much dead for the past year. If you haven't already been bag holding this stock it might be best to wait for a consolidation to really understand where this stock could be headed. Don't buy into green candles!!

1200,"Relief Bounce or Reversal? 4-22-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Happy Monday guys! Today the bulls finally after almost two weeks of showing zero momentum and back bone were able to rally the markets nicely. After 6 red days in a row a green day today was fairly certain and expected by most. However, now that we are in a downtrend and correction territory the question remains… is today a one day bounce before we start another leg down or has this correction reaching the daily 100ema gone far enough?

Objectively looking at today… despite the bulls best efforts we have a major rejection off the daily 8ema on ES and a major rejection off the daily 100ema on NQ… 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ohgng9q73wc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1ed9e8f315513e153d0850edb158c6b78a882a

We finally after 6 days of stronger selling on SPY have seen sellers weaken. With this weakness we are now getting a new demand (which reconfirms previous demand) at 495.06. On Friday the bears briefly touched and bounced off the daily 100ema support. Honestly with this support bounce we should likely be looking at a rally back to the daily 50ema resistance before we figure out what way we are going next. SPY does remain in extreme bear momentum. 

Bulls need to retake the daily 8, 20 and 50ema resistance to be in control. This means bulls need to close minimally over 509.2 to be back in control. There will be a wall of resistance from 508.05-513.45 for bulls to fight through. Channel resistance sits at 505.12 tomorrow. 

Bears will attempt to reject and double top off the daily 8ema resistance of 503.85. Daily 50ema resistance at 506.35 is another major level bears will attempt to defend. IF they do we could see a drop back to 100ema support/ demand near 495.06.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 518.01  
 Demand- 495.06 -> 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqkbdynq73wc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4257ec6bee451b3252a4a8de9bdb9cf18cf0edd

Looking at ES we are also seeing daily sellers weaken today and we also remain in extreme bear momentum on the daily. Now on ES Friday we actually got a new demand/ support at 5048. This gave us an imbalanced close which with todays pop and closure over that level rebalances our market. We remain in our white bear channel with resistance sitting at 5097 tomorrow. I start to turn bullish once bulls retake 5091. 

Bulls need to breakout over the daily 8, 20 and 50ema resistances at 5153 to be back in control. 5091-5114 will be a major rejection area with demands (previous supports) and daily 8/50ema resistance right there. 

Bears need double top off the daily 8 or 50ema resistance at 5120 to then target a move back down to 100ema support. This would give us a target of that triple demand near 4961-4989.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5243  
 Demand- 4961 -> 4974 -> 4989 -> 5048 -> 5091 -> 5114

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yla5ir2r73wc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad39ca02ccae7240af8b51c92d9e5d20d5c8129d

Much like SPY we finally are seeing daily sellers weaken after 5 days of stronger sellers… However, on QQQ we are actually about to fall back out of extreme daily bear momentum. With tech being far more bearish (over shooting like I said/ being more dramatic last week) we are actually still under the daily 100ema resistance on QQQ. We put in a new daily demand at 414.53 and we did break through our red bear channel resistance today. 

Bulls need to CLOSE and hold over the daily 100ema resistance of 421.58 to then target a move back to daily 8ema resistance of 426.6.Tech is in a far bigger correction that ES/ SPY is so I would likely need to see QQQ closed over 433.1 to see bulls fully back in control. 

Bears have an opportunity to fall back and close under daily 100ema support tomorrow. IF they can do that then our target will be a drop back to 414.53 demand/ support. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 445.36  
 Demand- 414.53 -> 424.49 -> 433.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5c4f11ir73wc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3c47389ac646d36cb89af382329556c3cab85c2

NQ also got a new demand/support today at 17180 and saw daily sellers weaken. However, NQ remains firmly in extreme bear momentum right now. 

We also remain in our white bear channel on NQ with resistance sitting at 17441 for tomorrow. 17579 being closed over on the daily is where I start to turn into a bull again. Until then I am neutral to bearish. 

Bulls need to retake and HOLD a close on the daily tomorrow over the 100ema resistance of 17458 to then target a bigger breakout to daily 8ema resistance near 17689. 

If the bears can reject daily 8ema resistance and target a closure under daily 100ema tomorrow we will look for a drop back to 17180 demand.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16981 -> 18489  
 Demand- 17180 -> 17579 -> 17857

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpbrc0wr73wc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ccf5b22259cc833d3c7c8c9dfad241a34b7424

The VIX is on an incredible drop right now. Since Fridays opening the VIX has fallen over 22% all while SPY rallied less than 1.5%.... For reference 4/12 to 4/15 the VIX rallied about 23% and SPY fell almost 3%... The VIX is firmly below the daily 8ema support now and is targeting daily 20ema support near 16.3.

If we see the VIX break this bull channel it has been in since the middle of March that might be our early warning sign that this support bounce off the daily 100emas is indeed our bottom. All eyes remain on the VIX. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Overall today was a good day of trading. I took a morning short that hit my 5pt bracket which sets a 0.5 PT breakeven… we ended up getting a big 5min double bottom to take my stop out before we of course did the major morning sell off… 

Took a nice long in my other account for 5 pts and then I was looking for an EOD reversal and we just continued to push without any support and stopped me out. I was just a few points too early on my short before the major drop we had into 245pm. 

Overall a green day for 3 accounts and red for 1. 

My APEX account is over profit goal and at 10days of trading so I will be leaving that account dormant until May 1st when I can request a payout. I will only be trading my MFFU accounts until then.

1225,"Bulls Continue Their Rally… 4-23-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

After yesterday bounce we were questioning whether this rally had legs or not. Todays pop to the upside continues to be driven primarily by options but it now takes us into even more critical resistance. 

On ES/SPY we are now coming into bears last stand at the daily 50 and 20ema resistance. On NQ we are now fighting at the daily 8ema and this leaves a good amount of upside before we get to the 20/50ema resistances. 

With Tesla earnings tonight it will be interesting to see how big tech reacts as we have more earnings later this week. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wygvm9adawc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f2217ba7a1cad1b6403f18fee9b9be7d8adf45

On SPY daily we continue to see sellers weaken today and now we are seeing bulls with an opportunity to break out of extreme daily bear momentum. We cleanly broke through the daily 8eam resistance without much effort and that took us right to the daily 50ema resistance. 

This is the major pivot level I talked about yesterday. If the bears are going to reject us and hold us in correction territory then we will need to maintain closes beneath the daily 50ema resistance of 505.37. To the upside if we breakout the daily 20ema resistance at 508.61 is the final nail in the bears coffin. 

Going into tomorrow… a closure over 508.61 (daily 20ema) and we likely are on our V bottom recovery back to ATHs into FOMC next week. If we close under 503.72 (daily 8ema) then we likely are seeing a relief bounce before we retest daily 100ema support. 

SPY DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 518.01  
 Demand- 495.06 -> 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pml3obnadawc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c452ea2614670da558f6a409c338223522480160

On Es we also are seeing daily sellers weaken here and also hard rejected right off the daily 50ema resistance. With our current white bear channel resistance also breaking today this gives quite a bit of upside potential for bulls tomorrow. IF we see a follow on green day tomorrow then our target will be the daily 20ema resistance at 5146.

If the bulls close over 5146 (daily 20ema) then likely we minimally will head back to 5200. IF the bears close under daily 8ema support of 5090 tomorrow we will be looking at a move back to 4961-4989.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5243  
 Demand- 4989 -> 5048 -> 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2atofr2bdawc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc39422681179e00409743a331fde171b1151958

Much like SPY we are seeing daily sellers weaken and we are attempting to break out of extreme daily bear momentum. On QQQ today we are facing a major rejection here at the daily 8ema resistance of 426.28. The bears have a major opportunity tomorrow to double top off the daily 8ema resistance and take us back down to the daily 200ema support near 421.47.

If the bulls close over daily 8ema resistance tomorrow then our target will be 432.2 which is the level the daily 20 and 50ema are sitting at together. IF the bears reject daily 8ema resistance then our target remains a move back to the daily 100ema at 421.47 and eventually 414.53 demand. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 445.36  
 Demand- 414.53 -> 433.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f4twyhbdawc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c6f5c0b8cd710b981f48892febdadcfc1131a4

Now on NQ despite the fact that daily sellers did weaken again we are actually seeing some of the strongest extreme bear momentum on NQ daily. We cleanly broke through the daily 100ema resistance and now we are facing daily 8ema resistance at 17657.

If the bulls can get a follow on green day and break through daily 8ema resistance our target is daily 20/50ema resistance at 17930. If the bears reject and hold resistance of the 8ema our target is a move back below the 100ema support of 17459 which then opens up a bigger drop back to 17180. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18489  
 Demand- 17180 -> 17857

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/75o6pvwbdawc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f26bae3400cb4c607862e4fbc2f54e04a2a782

The VIX continues to unwind which has brought a ton of upside relief and squeeze on this market. We have officially broken back under the daily 8 and 20ema supports which only leaves the daily 50ema support at 15.15 for a potential bounce. We also have previous demand before this upside VIX move sitting at 14.92. IF we see VIX closed under 14.92 tomorrow likely this is not just a relief bounce but an actual full recovery. 

For reference here though… SPY is about $13 lower right now than it was the last time the VIX was at these levels… 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6714iwacdawc1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ba1fffe277c1a853708c1fce1dd46c6d043c12

Like I mentioned yesterday I will not be trading my APEX account until May 1st as I hit my profit goal and my 10days of trading needed for a payout. 

I ended up getting stopped in one account on a short this morning when I thought we were going to find a rejection lower. I was however about one fifteen minute candle too early. 

I got BE stopped attempting to short in my other two accounts and then finally timed a decent short flash down. 

Overall 2 of my accounts green and 1 red. The account that’s red today was green yesterday and the $385 account was the only red one yesterday. Overall not a bad start to this week still. I do hope we get some better price action the next three days though as this was not very fun to trade today. 

For me today was a big win as I recognized after my first short this was a momentum based squeeze and instead of chasing shorts I just sat patiently and waited and waited till the perfect opportunity came. I let the short come to me instead of trying to force plays like I have done on momentum fueled days before.

1234,Unveiling the Future of Oil and Gas with $PDGO," Hey everyone,

Let's dive into a fascinating conversation about the future of the oil and gas industry, with a focus on the role of $PDGO in shaping this dynamic landscape. As the world transitions towards cleaner energy sources, $PDGO stands at the forefront of innovation, driving forward-thinking strategies and technologies to meet the evolving demands of the sector.

$PDGO isn't your traditional oil and gas company. Instead of adhering to conventional practices, they're embracing innovation and sustainability, redefining the norms of exploration, production, and distribution. From leveraging advanced technologies to adopting eco-friendly practices, $PDGO is paving the way for a more efficient, resilient, and environmentally responsible industry.

But what does this mean for the future of oil and gas? Well, for starters, $PDGO's forward-thinking approach positions them as a key player in the transition towards cleaner energy sources. By investing in renewable energy projects, carbon capture technologies, and sustainable practices, they're mitigating the environmental impact of traditional fossil fuel operations while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in the green energy sector.

Moreover, $PDGO's commitment to innovation and adaptability ensures their resilience in the face of evolving market dynamics and regulatory changes. As the global energy landscape continues to evolve, $PDGO remains agile and responsive, positioning themselves to thrive in a rapidly changing environment.

1237,Delving into Silynxcom ($SYNX): Potential Gem or Overhyped Risk?,"I've been closely observing the chatter surrounding Silynxcom ($SYNX) lately, and it seems opinions are divided. Is there more room for growth given the recent price targets hovering around $7-8? Or are we potentially looking at an overvalued stock struggling with execution issues?

While I'm intrigued by the possibilities, I can't help but consider both sides of the coin. Here's what's on my mind:

**The Upside:**

* Strong Partnership with 3M Peltor

**The Concerns:**

* Wide Bid-Ask Spread
* Limited Liquidity
* Few Execution Options

Silynxcom undoubtedly offers compelling advantages over traditional over-ear alternatives. However, the lingering questions revolve around market penetration and future guidance. Can they justify a surge past the $4.00 resistance level that's been stubborn since IPO?

1238,The GameStop Saga: Exploring the Phenomenon of $GME,"Hey everyone,

Let's delve into one of the most talked-about topics in the financial world: GameStop ($GME). The recent events surrounding $GME have captivated the attention of investors, traders, and the general public alike, sparking debates about market dynamics, short-selling, and the power of retail investors.

For those unfamiliar, GameStop is a brick-and-mortar video game retailer that has been struggling in recent years due to the rise of digital downloads and online competition. However, in January 2021, $GME became the center of a speculative frenzy driven by individual investors congregating on online forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets.

What unfolded was unprecedented: a massive surge in $GME's stock price, driven by a wave of retail investors banding together to ""squeeze"" institutional short-sellers who had bet against the company's success. The result was a meteoric rise in $GME's stock price, reaching unprecedented levels and causing significant financial losses for hedge funds and institutional investors.

The $GME saga has sparked intense debate about the democratization of investing, market manipulation, and the role of social media in financial markets. Supporters argue that retail investors have leveled the playing field, while critics warn of the risks associated with speculative trading and market volatility.

Regardless of where you stand on the $GME phenomenon, one thing is clear: it has brought to light the power of collective action and the potential for individual investors to disrupt traditional market dynamics. Whether this trend will continue or if it's merely a temporary anomaly remains to be seen, but one thing's for sure: $GME has left an indelible mark on the world of finance.

So, what are your thoughts on the $GME saga? Do you see it as a triumph of individual investors or a cautionary tale of market speculation?

1246,"Is This Our Failed Recovery? 4-24-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

Note- Tomorrow there will be no Daily TA as I will be out of town tomorrow afternoon and wont be back till late. I should be leaving no later than 1pm… over the next 2 weeks I do have quite a bit of stuff going on so I will have some days I miss.

Coming into this week I fully expected that we would bounce and likely head back to the 50ema resistance. We have officially made it back to the pivot point. The way I am seeing this market right now (specifically focusing on SPY/ ES) is that we have come up to the final resistance point of the daily 50 and 20ema resistance. IF the bulls can not only break through but close and hold over this resistance point we are looking at a true v-bottom recovery. However, if this rejection holds into tomorrow (I would not be surprised to see 50ema retested one more time) we are looking at our temporary top and most likely will be re-testing the daily 100ema supports. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yuqdusl5ihwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c6a15ef103550c2225fc4ba636e694ce758b09

We continued to see daily sellers weaken today and we also did not get a new daily supply today. One thing that makes me think we are not seeing a full top here yet and a true hard rejection is the fact that we have not seen daily sellers attempt to come back in and we have not threatened a new daily supply (resistance) yet. 

Today we came up and fell just short of our 508.05 resistance/ demand which is actually previous support. With a hard rejection off both the daily 50 and 20ema resistance this is a major resistance point that bulls did not have the strength to break through. 

If the bears can close us under todays low tomorrow likely we will be targeting 495.06 into EOW. 

If the bulls can close us over 508.3 tomorrow then we likely target a move to 515 into EOW.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 518.01  
 Demand- 495.06 -> 508.05 -> 509.77 -> 510.37

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6oa5p06ihwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7addc5ed4bc014a78cce1eed6a2b7ec4edcf0b

We are seeing a really nice daily double top on the daily ES chart here. With continued weakening in daily sellers and also a hard rejection off daily 50ema (and failure back to back days to close over it) we should look at 5117-5143 as major resistance here. 

However, despite this hard rejection the bears were not able to get us closed back under the daily 8ema support which would have likely signaled and confirmed this is a failed recovery. 

Bulls need to close minimally over 5117 but ideally over 5143 tomorrow to then target a move towards 5200.

Bears have to close us back under daily 8ema support which then signals a retest of daily 100ema support near 4986 is coming. 

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5243  
 Demand- 5048 -> 5186

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7skmyrn6ihwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50455e2c73959ca8808aa1c4c7791e29ace9b0b

I think QQQ and NQ show it way better than it does on ES/ SPY but this is shows a textbook daily bear flag here… we have our macro bear channel that we have held resistance of since 4/11/24. We are now in a 3 day recovery that has reached just under daily 20/50ema resistance and failed to push any higher. 

With this lower close than open on this candle and rejection here I am looking for a sizeable retrace tomorrow. Unless we open over 430.37 tomorrow we will break support of this 3 day uptrend and likely start a retrace lower. 

Bulls will need to gap up and breakout through resistance to close minimally over 431.6 to be back in control.

Bears need to close and hold under minimally daily 8ema support to then target a closure under 100ema support near 421.48.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 445.36  
 Demand- 414.53 -> 433.84

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eddowp27ihwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=74cb2ad66aa1313adfbdf64700667b08ef3007cf

Much like QQQ we have a textbook bear flag here… with this doji rejection and consolidation at the daily 8ema resistance we are seeing a very high probable rejection point here. 

For the daily green bear channel we have to break through resistance of 17754 minimally tomorrow to see this macro bear channel broken. If we do that then our target is 17908 which is the daily 20/50 ema resistance. 

To the downside if bears can close back under daily 8ema our target will be 100ema support near 17463.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 18489  
 Demand- 17180 -> 17857

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tuk34os7ihwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7159266c8ed9b77945c92247bbbb49ab167c778

The VIX has finally slowed its descent. We are also seeing the classic doji candle here on VIX that starts the reversal to the upside. Other times we have seen closures like this is 3/1 an 2/8 and 1/11. 

The bears did defend the daily 50ema support here on VIX also which gives our last stand. IF we see 14.92 demand break like I mentioned yesterday then likely that does signal that the recovery is not over and we should see further upside. 

If this is bottom and we close back over 16.78 the daily 8ema resistance then I would expect the flush to daily 100ema support to happen.

1262,$RILY Rising from the Ashes,"Alright, my fellow regards. It’s time to have a frank discussion about a sensitive subject. With the recent release of their 10-K, B. Riley Financial ($RILY) has reentered compliance with the SEC and is moving forward with operations, full steam ahead. Since November of 2023, $RILY has been plagued by assertions that they had knowledge of, and colluded in, the alleged fraud of Brian Kahn leading up to the collapse of Prophecy, a hedge fund. With both an internal audit that yielded no evidence of this fraud as well as an external audit that produced the same conclusion, a clean 10-K was produced yesterday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iglwefcaiowc1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5feb4beb1b5bb2e2f5e6247623dc23e4cd6347d

So, what does this mean for us regards?  With the 10-K being produced and many other positive catalysts coming up in short order, I’m looking at $RILY as a real investment option. With quarterly results coming on May 2nd (expected), preferred stock dividends, and the upcoming sale of the Great American Group, I believe momentum is shifting in favor of $RILY. 

# Financial Analysis

The 10-K post-audit closely resembles pre-audit numbers, a good sign. $RILY reported total revenues of $1,643.6 million, a 52.1% increase from $1,080.7 million in 2022, which was driven by improvements in a few key revenue streams:

•	Services and fees increased by 11.9% to $1,002.4 million.

•	Trading income and fair value adjustments on loans reversed from a loss of $202.6 million in 2022 to a gain of $41.8 million in 2023.

•	Interest income from loans and securities lending grew by 16.1% to $284.9 million.

•	Sales of goods rose by 121.1% to $314.5 million.

These figures suggest a strong recovery and upward momentum at $RILY. I believe that there is significant unrecognized value in $RILY, particularly in its trading and lending segments, which has been overshadowed by the recent allegations which are now cleared.

I can hear you regards screaming at me already, “But what about their expenses!”, and you’re right. A potential red flag is that operating expenses also rose to $1,498.9 million in 2023, up 48.2% from $1,011.2 million in 2022. This rise was primarily due to higher costs of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The increase in operational expenses correlates with the company's expansion and could be a positive indicator, but the Q1 results will be key to understanding the trajectory $RILY is on.  

# Valuation

B. Riley's total assets slightly decreased from $6.1 billion in 2022 to $6.07 billion in 2023 (not great) and total liabilities increased from $5.43 billion in 2022 to $5.71 billion in 2023 (also not great). 

As of December 31, 2023, B. Riley had approximately $2.34 billion in outstanding debt, which could impact its operational flexibility and financial sustainability in the long term. However, this is down from $2.42 billion in 2022, a 3.3% decrease (good).

There was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $37.1 million in 2023, compared to a decrease of $8.9 million in 2022 . This might indicate some constraints for $RILY in the near term, but it also makes them an attractive buy if they show improvement in this area. Q1 results on May 2nd will greatly inform how I move forward with my position on $RILY. Also, the sale of GAG would add a sizable chunk of liquidity (\~$300 million estimated), improving the light they’re in. 

$RILY is currently sitting on a P/E ratio (TTM) at 18.14 compared to the sector median of 11.32. There’s a bright outlook for the future of the group, and people are willing to pay for it. Their P/B ratio (TTM) of 2.88 compared to the sector median of 1.11 also indicates this positive sentiment for the future, and the P/S ratio (TTM) of 0.66 compared to the sector median of 2.62, a large reason why I think $RILY is undervalued right now. 

# Catalysts

So, with that behind us, let’s talk about what happens next. The release of the 10-K was a major catalyst for $RILY, as seen in the 37% jump we saw on Wednesday. Shorting of the stock muted the catalyst, with FINRA reporting that 53% of total volume on Wednesday was short volume, and updated bi-weekly numbers have it sitting at a 65.65% float. This pessimism is waning now that the 10-K has been produced, which short-sellers claimed would never occur. 

On May 2nd, Q1 results will be released, given more insight into how $RILY is moving forward now that their record has been proven clean. Furthermore, $RILY expects to report sale of GAG sometime in Q2, another major catalyst that is being closely watched. 

All in all, the next couple of weeks will likely see positive movement due to short term catalysts around $RILY, but Q1 results will really tell the story of whether or not this is a strong long-term investment.

# As a farewell, I remind you that this is not financial advice and recommend that you do your own DD. I bid you regards a good day.

1263,"BlackRock Says $12,000/t Copper Is Needed to Incentivize New Mines + How Junior Copper Explorer Prismo Metals' (PRIZ.c) (Returning 5.69% Copper from Samples) Is Positioning Themselves for the Demand","BlackRock's Olivia Markham suggests that copper needs to hit $12,000 per ton, a 20% increase from its current high, to motivate investments in new mines, due to disruptions at major mines and the necessity for more copper during the energy transition.

https://www.mining.com/web/blackrock-says-12000-copper-is-needed-to-incentivize-new-mines/

As the copper industry faces a shortage of mined ore, copper exploration companies stand to benefit from a potential bull run in copper prices. 

Prismo Metals Inc. (Ticker: PRIZ.c or PMOMF for US investors) boasts a diverse portfolio with three standout projects, including a copper exploration project.

PRIZ's Hot Breccia project in Arizona's copper belt holds significant potential for copper mineralization. Meanwhile, in Mexico, its Palos Verdes and Los Pavitos projects offer promising prospects for gold and silver exploration. 

https://preview.redd.it/bpehw2maopwc1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbbbcd48fa49dc6b9cdf950fb0c983dade2f1448

Recent exploration at Hot Breccia revealed samples with copper concentrations of up to 5.69%, alongside 0.24 g/t gold and 32.8 g/t silver, indicating substantial porphyry-related mineralization at depth. Diverse lithologies in the breccia pipes suggest a complex geological environment conducive to further exploration.

Full news here:

https://prismometals.com/prismo-metals-assays-up-to-5-69-copper-at-the-hot-breccia-project-in-the-arizona-copper-belt

Located strategically in Mexico's Panuco District, the Palos Verdes project has facilitated key partnerships, such as with Vizsla Silver (VZLA.v), providing financial support and technical expertise, bolstering exploration efforts.

In 2023, Palos Verdes yielded intercepts of 102 g/t gold and 3,100 g/t silver over 0.5 meters, translating to an impressive 11,520 g/t silver equivalent.

PRIZ's third project, Los Pavitos in Mexico's mineral-rich Alamos region, has identified crucial structural trends, including Las Auras, Santa Cruz, and Oromuri trends, alongside newly discovered parallel structures like La Española and San Jorge faults.

Assay results from 169 samples at Los Pavitos reveal significant gold concentrations, notably from the Santa Cruz and Las Auras trends, with values reaching up to 28 g/t gold and notable silver content.

1267,Bulls Defend Weekly 20EMA Support… 4-26-24 SPY/ ES Futures and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis,"  

As we finish up another week here it would once again appear that buy the dip is back. Bears had pretty much every single possibility to take this market lower this week and failed to do so. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivlpeohmrvwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ac0ba71cf03d2667a323e2ba392acc34fb4ec2

As we look forward to next weeks data and events the biggest thing we have to watch for is FOMC on Wednesday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfnwouvmrvwc1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=a146e591ef9e3b4e1b898a54ca51c2b0bb15776f

As we head into next week we continue earnings with the big names being Amazon, AMD and Apple. We have a bit of a mixed bag as we had solid beats by MSFT, GOOG and Tesla but Meta fell short. 

With earnings and FOMC next week along with critical jobs data we are set up for one crazy volatile week. 

**SPY WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pfi68obnrvwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29abee049f29cfefb9dc9a66751ca65a349541b8

Taking a look at the weekly chart here on SPY we finally after 3 weeks of red were able to put in a green weekly candle. This weekly candle is actually considered and inside candle which is not always a reversal candle… inside candles are actually often seen as continuation of previous direction candles.

The weekly sellers continue to come in stronger here and we continue to be in bearish momentum (not extreme). 

With a new weekly demand/ support at 494.86 this is now ultimate support. Until bears CLOSE under this level (which is also weekly 20ema) we are neutral to bullish. Now to the upside we are sitting at this weekly 8ema pivot point here near 509. Bulls need to defend that level and hold over it next week to be in control. 

To the upside our target is 523.21 and to the downside our target is 494.86.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 475.46 -> 523.21  
 Demand- 467.96 -> 494.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

*Processing img 5ljbdornrvwc1...*

Now as we move over to ES here we also got a new weekly demand/ support at 5000. Unlike SPY the weekly sellers on ES actually did weak here which actually provides a bit stronger of an upside case for next week. 

Right now we have 5000 as our critical support. If bears can close under that demand/ support then our target is a bigger drop down to 4733-4771. Realistically until bears close under that level which is also daily 20ema support they are not fully in control. 

The bulls ideally need to retake 5183 next week which is previous support that is not resistance. IF they do that and hold weekly 8ema support we could look for a bigger breakout back to 5307.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4771 -> 5307  
 Demand- 5000 -> 5183

**QQQ WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xkht8kaorvwc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a946f861e6597d26a7403967be48ca5d591da7ab

Now looking here at QQQ we have a similar set up to ES. We have weaker sellers here and got a new weekly demand/ support at 414.4. However, we did not breakout and close over weekly 8ema like SPY/ ES. 

If you look at ES/ SPY and QQQ/ NQ with this weekly 20ema support bounce and recovery we actually have formed a possible almost 9 month long bull flag here. If that bull flag resistance breaks out to the upside we really could see our next major leg up. After all these pullbacks are healthy for bull trends and we should really outside of a macro black swan event expect a bear market. 

Bulls need to breakout and close over 433.85 next week to then target 446.38. If the bears can close us back under weekly 20ema support of 423.28 and especially under 414.4 demand/ support we will target a bigger drop down to weekly 50ema support near 396.72 demand.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 408.58 -> 446.38  
 Demand- 414.4 -> 433.85

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fpzfwporvwc1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=15463c0dc7630d9d9a95734488d3edc44b89c73a

Looking at NQ here now we have weaker sellers here and we got a new weekly demand/ support at 17176. Much like QQQ we broke back over weekly 20ema resistance but we continue to reject weekly 8ema. Until bulls can retake that weekly 8ema resistance we are stuck here. 

Bears need to close us under weekly 20ema support and 17176 demand/ support. If they do our target is weekly 50ema support near 16455 demand. 

If bulls can finally take back weekly 8ema resistance next week then our targets will be a breakout over 18054 weekly demand which was previously support and is now resistance. 

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
 Supply- 16957 -> 18569  
 Demand- 17176 -> 18054

**VIX DAILY**

The VIX continues to unwind here and now is back to that critical pivot point of 14.92 demand. With the VIX now being closed under all the EMAs and hard rejecting daily 8 and 20ema resistance today the favortism certainly goes to a bull flag breakout versus a retrace. 

Next key level of support on the VIX is 12.78-13.24. However, there is still a change that this 14.92 demand can hold and bounce us into next week especially with FOMC on the horizon.

I didn’t post a TA last night as I was outta town and didn’t get back to late… people like to say only time I don’t post TA is when I have a red day so I went ahead and posted yesterdays Trade Log too. 

Overall today was a good day of trading. I honestly have found that Fridays have been especially painful to trade and we honestly say the same thing today. Most of the morning we were pushing up without any sort of proper support. I had to just be patient to finally find my perfect shorts. I was able to in two accounts grab two nice shorts on Nq and then in my other account I was able to grab a few points on ES. 

My APEX account only got traded once this week as I only needed one day of trading before I request a payout on May 1st. I again will leave that account inactive till May 1st and start trading after my payouts accepted. 

Otherwise all three of my MFFU accounts are in the green and looking strong. Overall a great week of trading with no complaints.

1268,Microsoft vs Google | Who's Winning?,"Alphabet and Microsoft are sending a clear message to investors: AI and Cloud Computing are two industries that are paying off.  
  
Both companies released their earnings, and let us tell you, they did GREAT. Alphabet surged as much as 12%, the largest gain for them since July 2025, pushing their valuation past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose by as much as 3.5%, which is an impressive gain for them.   
  
**The Main Details:**  
**Alphabet:**

* New cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, the first in the company's history. 
* The board of directors also approved stock buybacks of around $70 billion. 
* Total revenue rose 16% from the same period last year.
* Earnings per share beat estimates: $1.89 vs $1.53 expected.
* Cloud revenue rose 30%, and Ad revenue rose 13%.

**Microsoft:**

* Total revenue rose 17%, and Profits rose 20%.
* Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected.
* Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud Segment rose 21%.
* Azure and other cloud services rose 31%.
* LinkedIn revenue rose 12%, Xbox revenue rose 62%, and PC revenue rose 18%.

Both tech titans are locked in a battle over the dominance of the AI field, but it seems as yesterday's results show that the market thinks these two companies have room to grow together.

**Generative AI**  
2024 is the year of generative AI, and it looks as though technology that can create text, images, and videos with prompts is here to stay. Microsoft joined forces with OpenAi to challenge Google’s two-decade dominance of the internet, but Alphabet's own generative AI, Gemini, isn’t too far back. 

The space is becoming competitive, with both Alphabet and Microsoft executives saying their generative AI programs are driving more business for their cloud computing services. Corporate customers are also more open to making long-term investments in cloud infrastructure, increasing their trust in both companies.

Generative AI is giving a reason for corporations to come back and continue to use the cloud services of their company of choice. This gives the volatile tech industry some stability, with new demand and revenue coming in for both companies. 

**Google’s Trailing Cloud Services** 

This new intake in demand for cloud computing is a welcome turn for Google, which has long lagged behind industry veterans Amazon and Microsoft. After breaking even for the first time last year, the unit is now viewed as one of Google’s fastest-growing businesses and best bet for growth as its core search advertising unit matures. Google’s cloud operations pulled off a first-quarter profit of $900 million, well above analyst predictions of $672.4 million. 

**Gemini Comeback**

Google’s success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks it had in the generative AI consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model, formally known as Bard but now rebranded to Gemini, was criticized for answering prompts with historically inaccurate images, promoting the company to stop generating pictures and depictions of people with its software.  
  
However, since that obstacle, Google has been able to turn things around with Gemini. The enterprise product has told a very different story as the professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help ensure that the content released by the model stays consistent with their brand messaging to avoid mistakes like in Q1. Enterprise Gemini can be used to produce ads, videos, and podcasts.  
  
**Microsoft's Domination**

The narrative has been completely different for Google, with domination from the get-go. Generative AI has been an avenue for enterprise clients to spend more with Microsoft. The tech company has been infusing AI into the entire core product line with its technology partner OpenAI.   
  
The bet is starting to pay off as customers are adding Microsoft’s AI tools to help summarize documents and generate content. Alongside the addition of Copilat, Microsoft reported a 31% climb in revenue for its Azure cloud computing program, beating analysts expectations. 7% of this increase was attributed to AI which is a big deal. Microsoft’s GitHub coding platform is also gaining more traction, recording 1.8 million new customers during this period an increase from 1.3 million of last quarter. This is largely due to their AI-coding assistant powered by OpenAI’s largue language model, helping programmers streamline their code, answer any questions, and even convert code from one programming language to another.   
  
The company is also seeing a large intake in their AI assistance tool meant to work synonymously with their Office suite software. The new tool costs companies an extra $30 a month on top of their existing subscriptions. Corporate customers are many in number including Goldman Sachs, Ford Motors, and Ernst & Young. Microsoft estimates that roughly 60% of the Fortune 500 uses Copilat.

1270,Heavy News Week: OCG.v Announces Breakthrough Gravimetric Concentration Results for its Flagship Silver Project & Participation in 2 Conferences,"Outcrop Silver & Gold (Ticker: OCG.v or OCGSF for US investors) has unveiled groundbreaking findings from gravimetric concentration tests conducted at its Santa Ana project.

Spanning 27,000 hectares in the Mariquita District, the Santa Ana project boasts a legacy of recording some of Latin America's highest historical silver grades, and contains an estimated indicated resource of 24.2Moz AgEq at grade of 614 g/t AgEq and an inferred mineral resource of 13.5Moz AgEq at 435 g/t AgEq. 

https://preview.redd.it/5670qp87vwwc1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=723636acdddb25eb5e9cba7511117f3f89c4e435

The gravimetric concentration tests, designed to build upon already impressive extraction rates, have shown success in retrieving silver and gold via mechanical methods prior to standard flotation processes.

OCG achieved a 7% recovery of silver through gravimetric methods alone, complementing their 93% recovery rate via flotation, while the gold recovery rate via gravimetric methods was 30.52%.The resulting gravimetric concentrate yielded 2,883 g/t silver and 164.12 g/t gold.

On these results, OCG President and CEO, Ian Harris, stated ""This positions the Santa Ana project as one of the world's highest-grade primary silver endeavors, promising exceptional recoveries and highly marketable concentrates."" 

He added that the company has already started the next phase of test work to integrate gravimetric and flotation methods. 

In addition to its technical achievements, Outcrop Silver is actively engaging with investors and stakeholders. 

Ian Harris, President and CEO, is set to participate in the Uranium, Battery, and Precious Metals Investor Conference on May 1st at 10:30am ET and the company will also be participating in the Deutsche Goldmesse Spring Conferences on May 3rd and 4th at The Westin Grand Frankfurt, with online registration available.

1276,U.S. Lawmakers Call for Marijuana Rescheduling - I'm watching InterCure (NASDAQ),"U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, are [intensifying](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/u-s-lawmakers-call-for-marijuana-rescheduling/) their efforts this week by urging the DEA to reschedule marijuana. This move aligns with the growing recognition of its medical benefits and shifting public sentiment. Their unified stance challenges existing bureaucratic hurdles, suggesting that inter-agency disagreements should not impede crucial policy adaptations aimed at reforming national drug regulations.

The call for cannabis rescheduling is becoming louder and more coordinated, resonating through the halls of Congress as representatives from various states join forces. Led by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, the movement seeks to dismantle outdated perceptions of marijuana that have long influenced American legal and healthcare systems. Their efforts are not only a push against the DEA’s hesitancy but also an attempt to harmonize federal laws with the evolving societal and medical perspectives that recognize marijuana’s therapeutic potential.

Recent developments have highlighted a significant shift in how governmental bodies perceive and manage marijuana. By focusing on the potential health benefits that marijuana rescheduling could bring, lawmakers are emphasizing the need for a regulatory environment that supports medical research and therapeutic use. The narrative is shifting from viewing marijuana as a strictly controlled substance to a valuable resource in the medical community, potentially leading to breakthroughs in patient care and pain management.

Public opinion on marijuana has undergone a substantial transformation over the past decade, with a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana rescheduling for medicinal purposes. This shift is critical as it reflects not only changing societal values but also an increased understanding of marijuana’s benefits and relatively low risks compared to other controlled substances.

According to Stone Fox Capital - ""**InterCure Ltd.** (NASDAQ:INCR) has surprisingly rallied sharply off the post October 7 lows despite not having access to a prime facility in Israel. The cannabis business likely deserves a better stock valuation, but the dust needs to settle in both the Israel cannabis market and the conflict with Hamas. Stone Fox's investment thesis remains Bullish on the cannabis stock, even after the double off the lows already....InterCure only has a market cap in the $115 million range now, despite the business already being on a path for annual revenues topping C$150 million, or $110 million. The medical cannabis regulations expansion in Israel with forecasts for 70% growth due to the expansion of PTSD patients from the Israel-Hamas war along with the entry into Germany should only fuel growth in 2024, when the business returns to a normalized level as the dust settles in Israel.""  


Now, looking to the US - According to a recent piece on [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/content/38184335/pharmaceutical-cannabis-leaders-such-as-intercure-are-at-the-forefront-as-us-contemplates-cannabis-r), Pharmaceutical-Cannabis Leaders such as InterCure are at the Forefront as US Contemplates Cannabis Rescheduling: ""InterCure distinguishes itself, ready to leverage these changes owing to its strategic emphasis on pharmaceutical-grade cannabis. Unlike competitors such as Aurora Cannabis and Tilray, which have ventured into both recreational and medical markets, InterCure has unwaveringly concentrated on high quality pharmaceutical-grade cannabis. This focus is increasingly crucial in a sector where navigating the intricate web of regulatory, medical, and logistical challenges is key to success."" Moreover ""InterCure’s approach is in lockstep with the anticipated changes in US federal policy. The company’s steadfast commitment to regulatory compliance, effective distribution and M&A strategies, and the development of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis brands, positions it not just as a leader in the pharmaceutical cannabis space but also as a frontrunner poised to thrive in a market expected to become more regulated and medically focused following the potential federal rescheduling.""

From a daily perspective as we went into today the bulls were facing major daily resistance at the 20ema on ES and the 20/50ema on NQ. Though the bulls held us for most of the day and consolidated us we ended up not seeing the bulls push through these resistance. 

Tomorrow is pre-FOMC day and more often than not like today we are left with chop.

Despite the bears best effort and despite the rejections here we still did not manage to get a new daily supply yet. On SPY specifically we also do not have stronger daily sellers. We continue to just see sellers weaken but have not see official buyers return yet. Once buyers return I do imagine that starts our breakout. 

We had another touch and rejection off our white recovery channels resistance today at 510.75. That channels resistance sits at 511.36 tomorrow. 

Major support will come at the daily 8/50ema near 505.5. 

Bulls need to breakout to 512.78-513.45 and bears need to break down under 505.5.

Similarly here on ES we are seeing no new supply but a failure of bulls to breakout. 

The bulls need to defend 8/50ema support and breakout over 5150 tomorrow to target 5186-5202.

Much like on SPY we saw QQQ come up and touch the white recovery line resistance at 433.76 and hard reject it. That resistance for tomorrow sits are 434.86.

We do not have stronger daily sellers here on QQQ and we do not have a new daily supply either. 

The daily 20 and 50ema is a magnet right now. The bulls need to breakout over 435 tomorrow and the bears need to break down under 8ema support at 427.75.

Looking at NQ we also did not get a new daily supply and we have found strong resistance here at the daily 20/50ema. Though at the last minutes of the day we did push through it we still have heavy resistance from 17800-18000. 

The bulls need to breakout over this resistance and ideally close over 18000 minimally. The bears need to take this back under 8ema support of 17735.

I expected going into today that it was going to be a choppy mean reversion day and until PH that is pretty much what we got. Overall both ES and NQ had very small ranges today. 

I was able to take some nice plays in all three of my accounts to hit a nice green day. Overall no complaints here. I expect that we will see a similar day tomorrow. I had to leave at 1130 today so I didn’t get to trade after that and it will be the same for me tomorrow too.

1297,Hot Copper Market: $39 Billion Takeover Bid from BHP Rebuffed by Anglo American + Info on BIG.v's and ZEUS.c's Exploration in Idaho,"Copper is currently in high demand due to its use in various industries, including renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and solar panels. This surge in demand has led to a near two-year high in copper prices. Hammering home how hot the sector is, Anglo American recently rejected a $39 billion acquisition bid from BHP Billiton because they anticipate even higher prices in the future. 

Source: https://www.marketplace.org/2024/04/29/copper-prices-demand-green-energy-transition/

Reflecting this fervor, the copper exploration sector in the US may also be experiencing an upswing. Hercules Silver (BIG.v) recently discovered the Leviathan Copper Porphyry in Idaho, prompting significant investor interest, notably from Barrick Gold (GOLD), who made a $23 million strategic investment.

Situated just 1km from BIG's Project lies Zeus North America Mining's (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for US investors) Cuddy Mountain Project. Being in close proximity and on trend with BIG's find, Cuddy Mountain stands poised to reap the rewards of the heightened activity and staking interest in the area.

Historic data shows that Cuddy Mountain's historic Lead Zone Mine, Edna May Mine, and Rockslide area have promising mineralization. 

In May, ZEUS is planning to do a 3D induced polarization survey at Cuddy Mountain. Then over the summer, the company will do mapping, ground magnetics and rock grab & soil sampling.

BIG is also set to conduct an extensive drilling campaign at its project, positive results from which could reflect positively on the Cuddy Mountain Project and ZEUS.

1303,VTGN Shows Strong Pre-Market Performance,"Good morning everyone! After diving into some compelling bullish reasons for VTGN yesterday, it’s great to see that VTGN hit our 24-hour target. Today, we’re seeing positive movement in pre-market trading, suggesting another strong day ahead. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.

**Recap of Yesterday’s Projections:**

* **Short-term Prediction (4/29):** We anticipated VTGN would reach about $4.85, backed by recent performance and positive market sentiment.
* **Medium-term Prediction (Next 7 days):** We expect VTGN to continue its climb, aiming for $5.10, fueled by recent advances in clinical trials that are boosting investor confidence.
* **Long-term Prediction (Next 30 days):** Looking further ahead, VTGN is projected to approach $5.75. The company’s extensive pipeline for treating CNS disorders such as anxiety and depression positions it well in a growing healthcare segment.

Adding to our analysis, here's a snapshot of the latest ratings and sentiment: 

Notably, the ""Rating: Outperform"" further underscores our optimism regarding VTGN’s prospects.

1306,Bluebird (BLUE): coming back from the dead?,"OK here's the deal. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) topped out at $139/share in March of 2018 and has been on steady decline ever since. The company split into 2 entities in 2021 with ones goal to treat some forms of cancer, and BLUE continuing to focus on gene therapy using Crispr technology.

On Bluebird's [recent investor conference call](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-reports-fourth-quarter-and-2023-annual-results-and), they state that just secured a $175million loan from Hercules that will keep them afloat until 2026. They have very newly FDA approved drugs that cost millions of dollars per dose, and [have secured reimbursement agreements with medicaid](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/bluebird-inks-first-medicaid-coverage-agreement-sickle-cell-gene-therapy-signing-michigan) to cover the costs of administration. Their drugs - Lyfgenia ([sickle cell](https://www.bluebirdbio.com/our-focus/sickle-cell-disease)), [Skysona](https://www.skysona.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwrcKxBhBMEiwAIVF8rJup1wLdqBf-fduqEenWOPahAw69-spgCkpeqYjeHk08QeVLaV6FjBoClC0QAvD_BwE) ([cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy](https://www.bluebirdbio.com/our-focus/cerebral-adrenoleukodystrophy)), [Zynteglo](https://www.zynteglo.com/) ([beta thalassemia](https://www.bluebirdbio.com/our-focus/beta-thalassemia)) - rely on Crispr.

In **sickle cell disease**, patient's red blood cells are abnormally shaped causing repeated vast-occlusive events that are not only very very painful often requiring IV narcotics, but can cause kidney problems, lung infections, and even death. After one dose of Lyfgenia, severe events were resolved in 94% of patients, and completely gone in 88% of patients who received the drug. Life expectancy in Sickle Cell is only about 50 years and could be greatly extended if vast-occlusive events were reduced.

Patients with **beta thalassemia** are chronically anemic and are transfusion dependent their entire life-- after one does of Zynteglo, 9 out of 10 patients were TRANSFUSION FREE with normal blood counts.

**Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy** is a devastating neurodegenerative disease of children with no treatment outside of an incredibly risky stem cell transplant from a matched donor, and over half of children diagnosed will die within 5yrs of diagnosis. With Skysona, it cuts in half the chances of having major functional disability at 2 years.

Yes, Lyfgenia is more expensive than it's FDA approved rival ([Vertex’s Casgevy](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-crispr-therapeutics-announce-authorization-first)) which did NOT come with a black box warning, but, this was an earlier formulation of the drug, **only TWO patients in the study developed blood cancer** and **patient's with Sickle Cell are already at higher risk of blood cancers** than the general population, meaning this could just be coincidence. Additionally, Both Lyfgenia and Casgevy are similar in that you take the patients own stem cells, alter them with Crispr and give the altered cells back to the patient as a one time infusion. In order to tolerate the infusion, patients receiving either drug need **high dose chemotherapy** to calm down the immune system. The cancers mentioned on the black box warning for Lyfgenia are AML (acute myeloid leukemia), and MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome)-- **BOTH of these types of cancers happen more frequently in ANY patient who received chemotherapy**. It is very possible that the black box warning is just bad luck for Bluebird and it has nothing to do with the drug, it is a function of just the patient having sickle cell and getting chemo.

Cost wise, Bluebird's Lyfgenia is listed for $3.1 million for a dose and Casgevy for $2.2 million -- the most expensive medications of all time. Pricing is complicated, but Bluebird hopes to enroll about 100 patients this year and earnings will reflect that later in the year.

About 17% of the float is shorted, at about a 4.3:1 ratio of shorted shares to daily volume, so not a slam dunk short squeeze but if shorted shares are under-reported (LOL), and reddit jumps on the bandwagon it could at least get interesting.

I'm bullish. THESE DRUGS WORK. The cancer risk is overblown. A stock that once traded for $139/share WITHOUT a viable/sellable product now trading in penny stock territory at the same time they are FINALLY rolling out a product into patients veins, securing $175 million of funding to keep afloat until 2026, and getting medicare to agree to pay for the drug? Count me in. I know a lot of people got burned riding this down from 2018, but don't let that scare you away right before we go parabolic. Let's group together to keep this stock over $1 to prevent delisting. I predict a sharp rise to the upside after Fall earnings are reported, and continued growth from then on.

1308,Buying Pre-Ipo Stocks - Linqto Review,"I’ve been investing in pre-ipo companies for a few years now and really enjoy getting exposure to high-risk, high-reward stocks at cheap prices before they IPO. At the beginning I just used Equity Zen, but a platform I’ve been using a lot recently is [Linqto](https://app.linqto.com/signup?r=oc2hktsffi). Here’s my experience based on the past few months of using them.

Pros:

- Linqto has a LOT of companies available to invest in. They’re big names, too. Companies like SpaceX, Anthropic, Liquid Death, Epic Games, Ripple, etc. So it’s good for getting exposure to later stage startups that are likely to have an IPO in the next few years.

- Low minimums. For me this is the biggest thing. Most platforms have a $20k or even $200k minimum per investment. That’s a lot of risk in one stock. Linqto’s minimum is $5k which is much more manageable and allows me to build a more diverse portfolio of private stocks.

- They have a special offer for new sign ups. If you sign up [through this](https://app.linqto.com/signup?r=oc2hktsffi), you receive a $500 credit to put towards your first investment.

Cons:

- You still need to be an accredited investor to use Linqto. So for US residents that’s $1 million net worth or $200k+ annual income. As far as I’m aware, though, the requirements for some other countries like the UK are lower.

- Pricing. Linqto doesn’t charge fees or carried interest but they do sell shares at a premium. In my experience it’s generally 20% to 30% above the current sales price on platforms like Hiive. Hiive works on an auction model though, and you need to buy the entire batch of shares which can sometimes be in the $100s of thousands or even $millions. The premium shares on Linqto’s platform seems fair given the very low minimum investment, and the potential upside in the pre-ipo market.

Overall, I like their broad range of investment offerings and the ability to put just $5k into each. I still use Equityzen for some deals where I want to take a larger position, but I find myself using Linqto more and more to get some diversification.",1714500110,824636,teflchinajobs,t2_1khqxsyl,c820c79e4a813d8acb33306f47228ee1a5a8323ed97e5fe4e219279f1a11683d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1cgzb6o/buying_preipo_stocks_linqto_review/
1309,IDKFF Quick briefing *MUST READ* One crazy OTC stock here ,"IDKFF is crazy for an OTC. They’re basically a VC firm with over 70 investments in the hottest sectors including AI, blockchain, biotech, mining, cannabis

The CEO, Sheldon actually has a insane track record and had multiple unicorn exits in the past. Going to post a lot of DD on this company and their holdings

Being a VC firm, $IDKFF has exposure into equity in early seed financing rounds with companies that ordinary investors can’t even touch, especially with the accredited investor rule for private companies. This gives IDKFF shareholders a low entry points and a highly favourable risk/reward on their investments. Basically being able to invest in potential unicorns prior to going public or being bought out. With active investments in currently over 70 companies this is one to watch out for. 

$IDKFF CEO Sheldon Inwentash had success in the past with leading a holdings company, Pinetree Capital with some unicorn investments including Queenston Mining (acquired by Osisko Mining Corp. for $550-million), Aurelian Resources (acquired by Kinross for $1.2-billion) and Gold Eagle Mines (acquired by Goldcorp for $1.5-billion) just to name some.

I looked through some of IDKFF investments and already seen a few potential unicorns. Going to post about them next

1310,"Bear Flagging Into FOMC… 4-30-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

The long awaited FOMC day has arrived and markets have officially gone risk off into FOMC… This FOMC is going to be very interesting to see how JPOW not only handles questions but how he (the fed) position themselves with inflation back on the rise… last two FOMCs the fed brushed off how much inflation has rose and that it was basically a one off event and related to seasonality and we should not be concerned… it is very hard for JPOW to deny that inflation is out of control again and that the feds projected 75bps of cuts by EOY is likely not going to happen. 

I have a weird feeling though that JPOW may brush CPI off one more time… realistically we aren’t getting a rate hike nor a rate cut at this meeting regardless… we may see JPOW say that yes inflation has rose but we aren’t concerned about it yet. Realistically if he does that since we do not get a new DOT PLOT till June I could actually see the markets like last FOMC pump like crazy. However, any sort of pullback from JPOW about 75bps of cuts and this market is going to nose dive tomorrow. I expect a ton of volatility. I think the risk to reward of shorts/ puts is pretty good…

Looking at the last few FOMCs you can see for the most part we have been fairly bullish on FOMC days. There is a decent trend that if we open green we are more likely to close green that day. However the day we do open red and close red they are usually pretty significantly red. We have actually only closed red 5 times in the last 11 FOMCs.

Taking a look at SPY here we have a huge pop in the daily sellers once again here. We also finally got a new daily supply at 510.07. this rejection here also closes us back below the daily 8, 20 and 50ema support. This gives us next support at 495.06 demand which is also the 100ema support. 

Tomorrow being FOMC day I expect us to either close over 510.07 and breakout to 515-520 or I expect us to close under 500 and breakdown to 495.

ES also had stronger daily sellers come back in and got a new supply at 5148. With a rejection here and double top on the daily we are also closed below all the EMAs. 

FOMC likely either breaks us out and we close back over 5148 supply or we break through this potential daily bear flag support and close under 5048 support to then target 4961-4989.

 Supply- 5148

Similarly here on QQQ we got strong daily sellers and we put in a new supply at 433.08. However here on QQQ we had a really hard rejection off the daily 20/50ema resistance. And now are fighting around the daily 8ema support. 

I expect bulls to bounce here and close over 433.08 supply to then target 437-440 or bears to break this bear flag down and take us back to the 100ema support at 422. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 411.52 -> 433.08  
 Demand- 414.53 -> 435.33

Taking a look at NQ here we also have a strong rejection and double top here to form a new daily supply at 17917 and we saw a return of stronger daily sellers. 

We have a very similar daily bear flag here on NQ also. 

I expect with a hard rejection off the 20/50 ema and closure under 8ema to see bears target 100ema support near 17488. However, bulls may attempt to close back over 17917 supply to then target a breakout over 18000-18200 next week. 

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17917  
 Demand- 17180 -> 17980

As expected today markets went risk off and with going risk off we bounced and found a new demand/ support at 14.67. Now the daily 8/20ema resistance did hold fairly well on the VIX today. 

With a new supply on es/nq and a new demand on VIX we are likely setting up for a flush tomorrow (unless JPOW goes full dove). Bears would like to see VIX minimally close over 16 tomorrow.

Another pretty solid day of trading closing green in 2 of my 3 accounts. My last two NQ shorts I accidentally took the first one in the wrong account. I don’t generally trade NQ in all my funded accounts. I have one specific account I trade NQ in and I out of muscle memory clicked the wrong account initially. So not to risk profits in the other account quickly closed it out and then entered in my correct account. Had I entered the right account I would be green in all my accounts. 

I also passed a new EVAL (this gives me a back up funded to my 3 current funded) so that if I want to risk it on FOMC tomorrow in one of my accounts I can do that and not feel bad if it goes wrong… 

Overall a good day and week of trading so far. ",1714507664,824638,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,95990de1dd73d93b0078e3125bd56836e385284383e6fe5851a7aeda71b6fadc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ch2dmb/bear_flagging_into_fomc_43024_spy_es_futures_and/

1313,West Red Lake Gold Mines Unveils Robust 2024 Exploration Strategy for Madsen and Rowan Gold Projects + Analyst Coverage from Red Cloud,"Yesterday, West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) revealed its comprehensive 2024 exploration plan for its primary Madsen Gold Project and satellite Rowan Gold Project. The company outlined its strategic goals for regional exploration activities, emphasizing the considerable potential of both the Madsen and Rowan Properties within the Red Lake Gold District.

https://preview.redd.it/fqdsdlizjpxc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11e03243700e9da9f6288c9cc61d6b1df2d2f59

At the Madsen Property, West Red Lake Gold plans to conduct regional mapping and geochemical sampling, focusing on the Confederation Assemblage of rocks, an area largely mostly unexplored since 2014, covering roughly half of the land package. This initiative, starting in May, aims to fully uncover the property's exploration potential by identifying new targets through detailed geological mapping and sampling.

Similarly, at the Rowan Property, the company is preparing for extensive exploration efforts. With minimal regional exploration since the 1980s, the property is believed to hold significant untapped potential. 

Building on promising results from a preliminary orientation till sampling survey in 2023, West Red Lake Gold intends to expand its grid to cover more promising areas across the Rowan property in 2024. The exploration strategy at Rowan includes meticulous soil sampling and reconnaissance grids, using past survey results to identify and prioritize exploration targets.

Full 2024 plans: https://westredlakegold.com/west-red-lake-gold-outlines-2024-regional-exploration-strategy-for-madsen-and-rowan/

Regarding resource updates, West Red Lake Gold recently reported an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for the Rowan Mine Deposit, indicating total Indicated and Inferred resources of approximately 312,000 ounces of gold, reflecting a 62% decrease from the previous inferred resource estimate of around 828,000 ounces of gold. 

However, the updated MRE shows an improved gold grade of approximately 11 grams per ton (g/t) and adds approximately 196,000 ounces of gold to the higher confidence indicated category.

Red Cloud's recent report on West Red Lake Gold acknowledges the decrease in total gold resources at the Rowan Project compared to the 2022 estimate from the project's previous owners. However, the report suggests that the updated MRE is more realistic and geologically sound given the complex vein system. 

Although there may be short-term impacts on the stock, Red Cloud argues that the updated MRE provides a solid foundation for future gold resource additions through drilling and supports future economic studies. 

Additionally, it is important that Rowan is Westsecondary project to the company's flagship Madsen Gold Project.

1323,"FOMC Day… 5-1-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

In what I would call an impressive surprise here… despite what I would not call a very dovish FOMC meeting we saw a very large pump from the markets today. Lets take a look at what JPOW said and the fed had to say today (note all info taken from various social media sites). 

· The Fed will slow the decline of balance sheet by cutting treasury redemption cap to $25 bln per month from $60 bln starting June the 1st. 

· The Fed does not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until it has gained greater confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. 

· Restrictive stance has put downward pressure in inflation and economy. 

· Inflation eased substantially over the past year but is still too high. 

· Inflation is still too high and further progress is not assured. 

· Nominal wage growth has eased over past year, but the labor demand still exceeds supply.

· Inflation data received this year have been higher than expected. 

· It is likely that gaining greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. 

· We do not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until we have greater confidence inflation is going back to 2%. 

· Longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored though. 

· We will make decisions meeting by meeting. 

· So far this year inflation readings have not given us that greater confidence. 

· Reducing policy too soon or too much or too late or too little both have risks.

· Slowing the pace of QT does not mean our balance sheet will shrink less than it would otherwise. 

· I do think policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand. 

· Policy rate is restrictive. 

· We believe over time policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to 2%. 

· To hike rates, we'd have to see evidence that policy isn't sufficient to bring inflation back down to our goal. 

· We are focused on how long to keep policy restrictive. 

· It is unlikely next policy move will be a hike. 

· If inflation proves more persistent and labor market remains strong, then it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.

· But there are other paths which would point to rate cuts, but that would be if we gain greater confidence and unexpected weakening in labor market.

· We do need to take a signal from three worse-than-expected inflation readings. 

· Fed's Powell: (When asked about 3 rate cuts this year), only that the Fed needs more confidence on inflation and didn't see progress in Q1. 

· When we get confidence on inflation, rate cuts will be in scope. 

· My confidence in inflation moving back down is lower than before. 

· I am less confident than before that 2024 inflation will ease.

To be completely honest I am very surprised by the reaction by the markets today. While JPOW did a very good job of dodging every question he got that could even remotely hint at the fact we wont actually be getting 75bps of rate cuts this year and did a very good job of redirecting the question about rate hikes being a possibility… I am shocked that the markets pumped on what was said today. 

If you think about what the last 6 months in the market pumped on it was the fact that the markets believed we were going to get nearly 150bps of cuts before EOY 24… The market over the last month to two months pulled back on the fact that we were now likely to see 75bps max. Our current downtrend is directly related to that change of expectations. Today JPOW in not so many words said that there is no case for the fed to cut right now. He was once again very clear that we need to see GREATER CONFIDENCE (which they DO NOT have) to cut and that they want to see a closer move to 2% inflation first. We at 3.5% are no where near 2% and I just don’t see a world where inflation is going to basically drop by 1.5% in the next 4 months to give the fed confidence to cut rates. IF you think about it we have a June, July, September, November and December meets left for 2024. That is 5 meetings. If we assume the first rate cut comes in September… I would say minimally inflation has to continue on a downward trend and likely be under 2.5% minimally. That would mean from now until July (3 months) we need to see a near 1% drop or about 0.33% per month. There is very little odds that will happen. 

Now the one thing I can take as bullish here or good for the markets here is the fact that JPOW basically said we will do what is best for the economy. And he also completely doing a run around on any questions that relate to higher rates.

I wish I had checked this yesterday but forgot to… but as of right now the markets are only pricing in one cut for 2024… this is once again a market that does not believe the fed.

The next two days are jam packed full of data that will be interesting to see the markets reaction. 

Honestly going into Power Hour today I was ready to declare a bull victory… however, this impressive final hour reversal and dump completely changed the technicals. 

**SPY DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ocr5yqqehvxc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=367ec1d62b863063f418021a1c05a6e31f01fd0c

My targets for today were either 510.07 or 495.06. We were set to get a new demand and see sellers weaken until that final hour dump. We now have stronger daily sellers and a MASSIVE rejection off the 8, 20 and 50ema resistance. This keeps our bear trend in tact.  

We honestly still have a bear flag in play here until we break through the yellow channel resistance of 508.46 tomorrow. Being that the following day of FOMC usually continues the closing direction we should expect this white channel support to break down and let the bear flag drop begin. 

If we can break through 510.07 supply our target is 512.78-513.45 triple demand (previous support). 

Bears need to break through 500.5 support and target a closure under 495.06 which is the 100ema support tomorrow. 

SPY DAILY LEVEL  
 Supply- 510.07 -> 518.01  
 Demand- 495.06 -> 512.78 -> 513.08 -> 513.45

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

Our ES targets today were 4989 or 5148. We came very close to 5148 but did not quite get there. We attempted to put in a new demand just above previous demand/ support of 5048. However, we ended up holding that support but we have stronger daily sellers. With a hard rejection off the 8, 20 and 50ema here we should be looking for a backtest of the daily 100ema support.  

Bulls need to breakout over 5148 and target a breakout of this bear flag channel resistance at 5166 tomorrow. This would then give us a target of 5186-5202. 

Bears need to continue to reject daily 8ema resistance at 5090 and target a closure under 5048 to then look for 4961-4989 to be tested.  

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 5148 -> 5243  
 Demand- 5048 -> 5186 -> 5197 -> 5202

**QQQ DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8c6waxfhvxc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=987daae98cdd560c11d25c183821fb8394cb716d

On QQQ our target was 414.53 or 433. We got close to 433 but did not quite get there today. Similarly to SPY here we were set for a new demand and weaker sellers, however, we ended up with stronger daily sellers in the end. 

We continue to be in a potential bigger long term bear flag here and also continue to reject 8/ 20/ 50em resistance. 

Bulls need to push through this 433.08 resistance and break the channel resistance at 430 to then target 435.33- 436.95. 

Bears need to hold under daily 100ema resistance and target a move down to 414.53 demand tomorrow. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 433.08 -> 445.36  
 Demand- 414.53 -> 435.33 -> 436.95

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l3c24n9ghvxc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ac2d51c867602f204849cf40d103729eb73ff3

On NQ my target was 17980 or 17180. Impressively we hit neither despite a 400pt range today. We once again are seeing stronger daily sellers with this closure back under daily 100ema support. With this rejection off 8, 20 and 50ema resistance here I am fully expecting a retest of previous demand at 17180. 

Bulls need to breakout through 17800 tomorrow which is channel resistance and also breakout over the daily 50ema near 17917 supply. A closure over 18000 would be a solid upside signal. 

Bears must hold us under 100ema resistance and target a closure under 17180.  

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 17917 -> 18489  
 Demand- 17180 -> 17980 -> 18053 -> 18072 -> 18193 

**VIX DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/842s28nghvxc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=105f7aee40f992f542afaddd4132f81ba96e51f7

Much like ES/ NQ we had a fake out here on the VIX until the final hour of the day. Going into PH we were set up for a new supply and a closure below previous demand/ support which would have gave me heavy favoritism to upside tomorrow and for 12-13 to be retest on the VIX. 

Right now we are seeing a major bounce off 14.67 demand and a closure over daily 50ema support again. If we see the VIX breakout and close over 15.84 tomorrow which is 8/ 20ema resistance we could target an even bigger breakout to 18.25 supply again and that would certainly start a major leg down in this market.

I passed a backup MFFU eval yesterday as I wanted to play a short today into FOMC. I had quick 10pt scalp on the account I shorted in this morning and then my apex/ other MFFU I took a trade I stopped out at BE. I honestly just didn’t see anything I liked to trade this morning. 

I ended up shorting what I thought was a good spot and saw 10-20pts of profit a few different times only to have markets rip my face off. Honestly its not a big deal as this was my lowest profits account and I have a backup eval ready to go already to keep my 3 funded accounts. 

I was able to request my payout from APEX today too which is great and now ill go back to my 10 trading days on APEX and continue to trade my other accounts like I have. 

I am not too sad about losing a funded today as it’s a cheap prop to replenish. My third MFFU account as you can see I didn’t touch today.

1326,How TMAS.c is Working to Meet Titanium & Vanadium Demand For National and Global Security,"Despite sanctions intended to weaken Russia's ability to wage war, Bombardier, a Canadian jet manufacturer, is partnering with a Russian titanium supplier. This supplier has been found to provide parts for Russian missiles and drones, which are used to destroy Ukrainian cities and harm civilians.

https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/bombardiers-import-of-russian-titanium-enables-russia-s-destruction-of-ukraine/article\_0552058c-0657-11ef-a053-57ffcc2232a9.amp.html 

This shows how securing a domestic supply of Titanium is critical for upholding Canada's geopolitical interests and supporting international efforts for peace and stability. Similarly, the U.S. Department of the Interior has deemed titanium and vanadium as essential to both national security and economic stability.

Temas Resources Corp. (Ticker: TMAS.c or TMASF for US investors) is on a mission to help meet domestic and global demand for titanium and vanadium.

Strategically positioned in the Grenville Geological Province of Quebec, TMAS operates within the vicinity of the renowned Lac Tio, known for housing the world's largest solid ilmenite deposit. This area is recognized for its favorable mining conditions and stability, where TMAS conducts its operations at the La Blache and Lac Brule Projects.

The La Blache Property encompasses 127 mineral claims, primarily centered around the Farrell-Taylor deposit, where more than 15,000 meters of drilling have already been completed.

Recently, TMAS unveiled a preliminary economic assessment for La Blache, forecasting a net present value of $6.6 billion over a 14-year mine life. This projection is based on an annual production of 660,000 tonnes of titanium dioxide, with a payback period of 25 months and an internal rate of return of 60.8%.

Covering 36 claims across 2,016 hectares, the Lac Brule Project is situated within the Labrieville Anorthosite Complex. Previous drilling and metallurgical tests have shown promising results, indicating high concentrations of TiO2, V2O5, and iron oxides.

The company also boasts a robust portfolio of intellectual property and patents, particularly focusing on sustainable extraction and processing technologies, often in collaboration with esteemed institutions such as the University of Minnesota.

TMAS has made significant strides in using their unique metallurgical processes, as demonstrated by successful pilot plant testing resulting in a 97.8% titanium dioxide (TiO₂) product. This underscores their commitment to employing top-tier, environmentally conscious extraction methods.

With approximately 16.4 million shares issued and outstanding, the management maintains a direct ownership stake of around 13%, reflecting their strong dedication. Additionally, 40% of shares are held by trusted associates, friends, and family.

NOTE- I will be out of town tomorrow through Monday. I will NOT have a weekly TA tomorrow. I will not be trading and will NOT have a pre-market up either. I will return from out of town on Monday. If we get home early enough I will attempt to push a TA out for you guys. 

When we look at the last 11 FOMC meetings there has only been 3 times (4 now including today) where the markets have opened the opposite direction that it closed on FOMC day. Meaning that if we closed green on FOMC day then pre-market is generally green too. Yesterday we saw some extreme volatility in the markets with the major pump during JPOW presser only to sell off during the final hour. Today it would appear that sell off was not bears taking control. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6xr1u4zcm2yc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=748f09b867dbd59e2fbf10e5680fa80391a6542b

Tomorrow we get the critical Unemployment Rate… as of right now markets are expecting 3.8% which is unchanged from previous. Remember from the presser yesterday the theory is that the economy is going to naturally weak to take inflation down and prove that the current fed funds rate is enough. 

IF you look at the last 2+ years of UE rates we have not seen a rate higher than 3.9%. The median we have seen has always been 3.5-3.7%. Our extreme levels have been 3.4% and 3.9% and everytime we touch those extremes we have reverted back to our 3.5-3.7% mean. This would mean that we should expect a drop to 3.7% minimally tomorrow. 

UE rate is actually one of the more volatile data points we get and usually can illicit a 1% +/- move. My thoughts are that if UE comes in 3.7% or lower we could see a major drop in the market… if we come in 3.9% or higher then likely we will see a major Friday breakout.

Objectively for the last 14 trading days we have ranged at close from 495.06-510.2. As much as I would like to see some direction in this market there is a very high probability that we are going to be range bound trading here for a while. 

Daily sellers did weaken today but we once again continue to see no daily buyers which limits upside potential.

The bulls need to close minimally over the daily 20ema resistance of 506.68 to then target 510.2 support. 

If bears can close us under 500.22 then we could target a breakdown back to 100ema support at 495.06 demand.

Similarly here on ES we have daily sellers that weakened but have yet to see daily buyers return. We once again came within seconds of getting a new daily demand but fell just short.  

Much like SPY we have realistically been ranging from 4989-5148. 

Bulls need to close over 5121 (daily 20ema) resistance minimally to then target 5148. 

Bears need to close us under this demand of 5048 (previous demand) to then target a bigger drop back to 100ema support of 4989.

QQQ also saw daily sellers weaken but barely fell short of putting in a new demand/ support.  

QQQ objectively has been in a range of 414.53-433.08 since 4/15/24. 

The bulls defended the daily 100ema support today and now need to minimally close over 430.95 the daily 20ema resistance. 

The bears have constantly rejected the daily 20/50ema resistance for the last week. They need to close under daily 100ema support.

With the bounce off daily 100ema support and weaker daily sellers NQ also was close to a new daily demand but fell just short of putting one in. 

Bulls need to use this 100ema support bounce to target 17864 the daily 20ema to close over minimally. 

Bears need to reject the 20/50ema resistance and close under the daily 100ema support of 17487.

Today honestly was one of those days I despise trading. I am not quite sure how to describe why in words but just the way the morning price action and technicals present themselves I struggle to find my A+ setup. 

I was able to find a nice short this morning that I took with ES in two accounts ( I should have taken it in all 3) and then took an NQ short in my 3rd account. Ended up getting out way too early but perfectly took a short there for some nice profits. 

I attemptd to short what I thought was a rejection prior to the market squeezing higher. I really did like the short and would fort sure take it again if it presented itself the same way. 

Overall green in three of four accounts so I have nothing to complain about. 

Closing the week out (since im not trading tomorrow) green for the week in three of my accounts and red (down $6) in one of my accounts. Another good week of trading. 

I have been reflecting back and I was talking in my server to a few people about since I have REALLY slowed down and only taken A+ setups (Even if it means waiting till noon to trade) I have had far better success and I have not had a true red day in a very long time. IT requires far more patients but it is completely worth it. Slow and steady wins this race….

1338,Sam Altman‘s stock ALCC to acquire Oklo | CLEAN ENERGY fission company going public,"Just posting here in addition to my other posts in case anyone finds this info beneficial and hasn’t heard of this upcoming merge/ acquisition - while it is still almost in the voting phase, it’s 99% guaranteed as they would be shooting themselves in the foot it they don’t acquire Oklo.

Btw merges tend to happen 2-7 days after the vote.

**TLDR**
Acquisition vote is *May 7th* for Oklo to go public via SPAC vessel *ALCC*

Ticker *ALCC* (Sam Altman is CEO) is expected to behave similarly to boom upon Oklo acquisition due to these factors: Sam Altman, Sam Altman, and Clean Energy.

**Highlight Points**
• Sam Altman has the golden thumb
• Sam Altman founded ChatGPT
• Sam Altman has “worshippers” just like Donald Trump has his “cult” (which made DJT rocket in a single week despite not being a profitable business nor having a bright future)
• his name on this coupled with clean energy is rocket fuel

1344,"ALCC, Why I believe this stock could explode","ALCC is a company exactly like DWAC was to DJT. It is set to merge with another company next week after it passes the vote on May 7th. Donald Trump’s name was the driving factor to why DWAC went from $10 all the way to $70 during the weeks of the merger. The name that is linked to ALCC, the founder of this stock, is none other than Sam Altman: The man behind ChatGPT, the man behind the recent AI boom and the CEO of OpenAI.

ALCC is taking Oklo public, a nuclear fission company that can provide the cheapest and cleanest energy to run any AI data center in the world, according to Altman, who is also chairman of the board of Oklo. But, the company ALCC is taking public, you could say that it almost doesn't matter, Why? Because that’s what we learned from Dwac. Dwac mergered with a company that has under 10 million in revenue and yet still reached 10 billion in market cap.

ALCC also has a low market cap which means the stock price can be influenced with less investors and less money than even DWAC/DJT right now.

Tldr: Sam Altman the man responsible for the recent AI boom(Chat GPT, OpenAI) is the man behind ALCC, which is set to merge with another company next week. Low market cap, AI hype, huge name behind the stock. This stock has a great chance to explode in my opinion. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity since DWAC. Your thoughts?

1352,AMQ.c Drill Results from its B26 Polymetallic Deposit Including 44.5m At 2.82% CuEq,"Yesterday, Abitibi Metals Corp. (Ticker: AMQ.c or AMQFF for US investors), a Quebec-focused mineral acquisition and exploration company, announced the latest breakthroughs stemming from its ongoing exploration endeavors at its B26 Polymetallic Deposit.

https://preview.redd.it/7ue3qu2vwayc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=b82a37b4502da9713b841e7db993812f1e57dfa3

The standout results from the program come from Drillhole 1274-24-339, which intercepted a staggering 2.82% CuEq over 44.5 meters, underscoring the deposit's high copper mineralization potential.

Jonathan Deluce, CEO of Abitibi Metals, expressed his enthusiasm, stating, ""The drilling at B26 continues to deliver exceptional results…. \[Hole #399\] continues to add to the goal of better defining the high-grade lens while also outlining the lower-grade near-surface halo, supporting our bulk-tonnage open pit target.""

The B26 Main Deposit, boasting a continuous strike length of 1.0 kilometer, represents a cornerstone in Abitibi Metals' strategic portfolio. 

Driven by a vision of sustainable resource extraction, the company remains steadfast in its pursuit of unlocking the deposit's full potential. 

Deluce added, ""With the copper price breaking out, projects like B26, located in the world-class jurisdiction of Quebec, stand out globally for their potential to deliver critical metals at a time when there is a clear rising need for copper.""

Abitibi Metals' resounding success is further underscored by its robust financial position, with $18 million earmarked to fuel future exploration initiatives.

1360,"$RILY fundamentals getting better , short funds get dirtier","$RILY the better fundamentals are making the short funds nervous and desperate

I’ve been invested in $RILY for half a year and been watching it for the past year I’ve watched how the short funds started their attacks on $RILY and with every accusation that was proven to be false the shorts would just come up with another accusation and false narrative ,all for one purpose to manipulate the stock lower. as the efforts kept being debunked the dirtier more experienced shorts were recruited , enter cohodes&co. Cohodes& his accomplices had the money and connections and utilized their relationships with hedge eye,SA , Bloomberg and wsj to disseminate their false narratives and also recruited ambulance chasing attorneys to echo all their accusations as they looked for victims of what cohodes& co concocted. Through their various networks and ability to short large volume of shares they were able to manipulate the share price from the 50s into the teens, hyping their followers to join the fun in the 20s. All this destruction of share price occurred due to the short funds scheme which has now been shown to be outright lies , fraud and manipulation. Short funds double down on lies during blackout periods as they know the company can’t reply. I have witnessed this so many times already I can predict the next one. As an example on Friday investor place for some strange reason posted last year’s earnings as this years and it was then reposted by msn, many brokerages and other platforms , mistake? Or part of the short fund efforts? Then another recycled accusation to panic longs and new investors about the 10q knowing the company can’t reply and has been in business for 30 years repeatedly filing all necessary filings. As shown by the 10k filing that the same short funds said would never be filed , that’s after they claimed they had inside information that company was being raided and will closed down prior to Easter , or that division were being shut down or that auditors quit, all were lies and there so many more and I believe there will be more to come no matter how outlandish as they need to exit. They have spoke about all the worthless companies $RILY has invested in and they are not worth anything close to what’s on the balance sheet but $RIlY announced that Great American which was on the books for 35 million is being shopped around at a valuation of over 300 million. Short funds claimed dividend wouldn’t be paid , but yet quarter after a high dividend is paid. $RILY has bought back shares and is still buying back more shares and is buying back its bonds both at a discount. This is just quick summary as to why short funds are nervous and will do anything as it’s quite obvious based on recent 10k the company is improving fundamentally. The above is the reasons I invested in $RILY and continue to invest in $RILY

1376,SHL Telemedicine's SmartHeart could change the face of Cardiac Care Amid Rising Healthcare Costs (NASDAQ: SHLT),"The prevalence of cardiac diseases worldwide presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems and patients alike. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually. Beyond the human toll, the economic burden of CVDs is staggering, with healthcare expenditures related to cardiac care reaching hundreds of billions of dollars each year.

In response to this growing crisis, healthcare providers and innovators are increasingly turning to telemedicine as a means of improving access to cardiac care and reducing healthcare costs. Among them is SHL Telemedicine, a pioneer in the field of telehealth, whose innovative approach to remote cardiac monitoring is reshaping the landscape of cardiovascular care.

SHL Telemedicine has emerged as a beacon of hope for cardiac patients seeking innovative solutions to their healthcare needs. With over 30 years of experience in the field, SHL has established itself as a global leader in telehealth, specializing in the development and provision of advanced cardiac monitoring technologies and services.

Central to SHL's approach is its SmartHeart® platform, a state-of-the-art portable 12-lead ECG technology that enables remote cardiac monitoring and data transfer. Unlike traditional cardiac monitoring devices, which are often bulky and tethered to healthcare facilities, the SmartHeart® platform empowers patients to monitor their cardiac health from the comfort of their homes, providing real-time insights and actionable data to both patients and healthcare providers.

Moreover, what sets SHL's SmartHeart® apart is its unique ability to detect potential heart attacks at home, offering patients unprecedented peace of mind and timely intervention. By leveraging the power of mobile and remote 12-lead ECG technology, SmartHeart® enables users to not only monitor for arrhythmias but also to detect changes indicative of myocardial infarction, allowing for swift action and potentially life-saving interventions without the need for immediate hospitalization.

I wasn’t here Friday or Monday to trade but I was able to watch a little bit of the market. Friday morning I did snag a few trades before I left but Monday I did not get any trades in. Overall the bulls have put in a pretty impressive four days of trading.

The next three days we have bond auctions and then the consumer sentiment report on Friday. The big thing I am watching though will be CPI next week. 

Since I didn’t get a TA out on Friday and Monday I will attempt to give a bit more details of where we came from and where we are going here.

Spy is the only one that has not seen daily buyers return. We put in a new demand at 504.16 last week and now we are back over the EMAs here. Right now we have our triple supply resistance here from 518.01-523.45. This level was touched and hard rejected today. We are going to need to see daily buyers return here likely in order to push us higher. Right now our macro range is 495.06-523.45.

Bulls need to see buyers return to the market and ultimately their target is to close over 523.45 double confirmed supply/ resistance. 

Bears need to reject this triple supply and we will look for a drop back to EMA support of 510.23 which is also previous supply. This is generally the move I am looking for over the next few days.

We have seen Es have stronger daily buyers for the last three days in row now. This is the first time we have had daily buyers like this in over a month. We also have not quite got back to our 5243-5309 triple supply range resistance. 

The macro range here is 5049-5309.

Bulls need to continue to see buyers come in and will look for a closure over 5309 supply to signal the next major breakout. 

Bears are looking for a rejection here and target of 5148 supply which is also the daily 8/20ema support area too. I will be looking for this support backtest over the next few days before we make another run at range resistance.

Taking a look at QQQ here we have stronger buyers for the last two days in a row now. This doji daily candle here does setup a nice retracement back to EMA support tomorrow. 

We are coming into the resistance of 442.14 from 4/15/24. Our macro range here is 414.53-446.44. Bulls will face major resistance and rejection potential at double supply of 445.36-446.44.

Bulls need to continue to see daily buyers here and target a closure over 446.44.

Bears are going to look to backtest the daily 8/ 20/ 50ema support near 433.08 supply over the next few days. This is what I am looking for and this would provide a nice dip buying opportunity.

Despite having stronger daily buyers here on NQ we closed out a nice little rejection here. We did not get new supplies on any of the four today though. 

18489-18582 is going to be a major double supply/ resistance area to watch. Our macro range here is 17180-18582.

Bulls need to continue to breakout with stronger daily buyers and target a closure over 18582.

Bears are going to look to backtest 17917 supply which is also the 8, 20 and 50ema support. This would likely provide the major support bounce to target a breakout to macro range resistance.

The VIX put its new supply and resistance in at 15.15 with the major rejection of daily 8/20ema resistance. Since our closure under 14.67 demand the VIX has just continues to unwind. 

Truthfully it makes sense that the VIX is unwinding post-fomc… while I still strongly defend that JPOW was anything but dovish… he danced around the words well enough that he did not put the fear into the markets… the VIX is now coming back into MAJOR demand/ support from 12.07-12.78… I would as I said last week not be surprised to see the vix back in the 12s by EOW. 

One thing to keep in mind as we go forward and now that the VIX is back near 12-13 is that volatility measured and realized (IV included) is MUCH lower than last week or the last month of trading… we cant expect 80pt ES and 400pt NQ days anymore… this means we may see much longer holds and buying at critical resistance and holding is the play… if you are scalping then expect much less reward.

Today was a good day of trading.. I had the short on NQ this morning correctly this morning I was just a smidgen too early and got stopped out. I was able to re-enter for a nice win. Overalll I am happy to get a green day today. 

Much like yesterday markets found itself in a very choppy and tight range with technicals that constantly contradicted itself it seemed like. Today was not (for me) a day to hold for targets but a scalping day.

1388,"SPY Closes 5th Green Day in a Row… 5-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","  

After 4 green days in a row we finally saw a little fight from the bears today. Arguably though the fight the bears had was quickly weakened with options squeezing and the VIX crushing. Thanks to the VIX that refused to stay elevated bulls squeaked out the tiniest of green days today. Markets survived the first of two major bond auctions which the second one will take place tomorrow. 

**SPY DAILY**

After almost two months straight of daily sellers we finally are seeing SPY transition back to daily buyers. Despite the rejection today and continued fight at 518.01 we continue to see no new supply. This is now the 2nd day in a row I suspected a rejection that just never came. 

Realistically not much has changed from yesterday… 

Bears need to close under 511.8 which is daily 8ema support to targets 510.2 supply and bulls need to break through 518.01 supply to target 520.6 and 523.45.

Very similarly here on ES we continue to reject the upside here with very small amount of stronger daily buyers. IF we were to get a big push up tomorrow to push the daily 8ema higher we could actually see this be the daily 8ema support test. We continue to see no new supplies here either. 

However, we are pretty much left in the exact same spot as yesterday… 

Bulls need to continue to see buyers come in and will look for a closure over 5309 supply to signal the next major breakout. 

Bears are looking for a rejection here and target of 5148 supply which is also the daily 8/20ema support area too. I will be looking for this support backtest over the next few days before we make another run at range resistance.

The Qs and NQ look very similar to SPY and Es and to yesterday… truly not much has changed as daily buyers continue to be stronger and we continue to see no new supplies while we reject upside. 

Bulls need to continue to see daily buyers here and target a closure over 446.44.

Bears are going to look to backtest the daily 8/ 20/ 50ema support near 433.08 supply over the next few days. This is what I am looking for and this would provide a nice dip buying opportunity.

NQ is actually the only one that did not see stronger daily buyers today. However, we did not get a new supply and continue to be setup like today didn’t even happen from a technical stand point. 

Bulls need to continue to breakout with stronger daily buyers and target a closure over 18582.

Bears are going to look to backtest 17917 supply which is also the 8, 20 and 50ema support. This would likely provide the major support bounce to target a breakout to macro range resistance.

Today was a great day of trading for me yet again. I was able to use the tighter and smaller intraday ranges to trade NQ once again for some bigger wins. NQ obviously brings a bigger loss if you hit the -20pt stop loss but there are a lot stronger of gains and dollar to be had if you find the right play. 

Overall today I expected stronger downside than we had one again. We continue to be in a mean reversion type of market. 

Finding critical resistance and support points to go long/ short and taking some smaller gains is still the move here… we are not in a continuation market and I do not suspect to be in one for a while.

1390,Looking for $EVKRF to have a similar bounce + breakout from the ascending triangle sometime this week!,"$EVKRF recently pulled back from .059 all the way to .30 and back into the ascending triangle. Within this pattern back in April, there was an attempt to break upward recently, as indicated by the temporary spike above the upper trendline. However, the price quickly fell back inside, indicating a false breakout. 

With the price right on the trendline, I am looking for another bounce and a continued rally for another breakout similar to the last one. This is a swing trade, but I don't plan on holding this one into next week. Make sure to watch the volume to confirm the breakout so you dont get faked out again Take profits when you see them! I hope this was informative and helpful!

**Price Targets:**  
.045 - 18.5% gain

.5 - 30 % gain

.055 - 45% gain

https://ivanhoeelectric.com/news/ivanhoe-electric-announces-exploration-alliance-with-bhp-to-accelerate-the-search-for-copper-and-other-critical-minerals-in-the/

This news of BHP's substantial investment in copper exploration as well as copper prices touching $10k today shows the escalating interest in the Western US' copper exploration sector. 

This fervor finds resonance in Idaho, where Hercules Silver's Leviathan Copper Porphyry discovery triggered a flurry of land staking activity and significant investments including from industry giants like Barrick Gold (GOLD Mcap = $28.9B) who invested $23 million in BIG to advance their project.

Benefiting from its strategic location amidst rising activity and increasing stakeholder interest, Zeus North America Mining's (ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for US investors) Cuddy Mountain Project sits a mere kilometer from BIG's Project.

The Cuddy Mountain Project features promising historical mines like Lead Zone and Edna May which have exhibited rich mineralization.

Currently, ZEUS is planning a 3D survey followed by mapping and sampling at the project. 

This aligns with BIG.v's upcoming drilling campaign, the results of which could reflect positively on ZUES' Cuddy Mountain Project if positive.

**First up: CDZI (Cadiz Inc.)**I mentioned this one yesterday, so here's a quick price prediction summary:Cadiz Inc. (CDZI) is currently trading at $2.32. Based on technical analysis and machine learning predictions, the ultimate price target is **$2.45 (5%) on 5/9/24** and **$2.62 by the end of next week (5/17/24)**.

* Despite a long-term bearish trend, recent consolidation and low trading volume suggest potential upward movement, supported by an oversold RSI and a bullish MACD crossover.
* If positive sentiment continues, breaking above $2.40 could accelerate gains. The linear regression model aligns with this bullish outlook, projecting further gains due to improved market sentiment.

**Second on the list: EVKRF**We’ve played this one a bunch of times and done well. I got this idea from a trusted user, so we're hitting it again!

* EVKRF is currently trading at $0.0383. According to technical analysis and machine learning predictions, the closing price is expected to be **$0.042 on 5/9/24** and **$0.048 by the end of next week (5/17/24)**.
* The 50-Day MA is slightly below the current price, and a bullish MACD crossover signals potential upward momentum.
* Recent consolidation and increased trading volume suggest renewed interest, with support at $0.035 and resistance at $0.045. Breaking this resistance could lead to more gains, backed by the linear regression model's growth prediction.

**Last on the list: SAVE (Spirit Airlines Inc.)**I'm not gonna lie to you guys—this company is trash. But we can still make money on trash. Sometimes, treasure is found in trash. For Spirit Airlines, it will likely remain trash fundamentally, but from a TA perspective, we could see some gains soon.

* I'm aiming for an ultimate target of **$3.55 by the end of next week**.
* The 50-Day MA is just above the current price, while a bullish MACD crossover and an approaching oversold RSI hint at potential upward movement.
* Recent consolidation between $3.20 and $3.60, along with rising trading volume, suggests growing investor interest.
* SAVE is the riskiest option IMO, as we could keep heading south, but we could also see some awesome gains. At the very least, add this one, and the others, to your watchlist!

**In conclusion,**I hope you find this watchlist valuable! Consider keeping an eye on these!

1403,Royal Helium (RHC.v RHCCF): Canada's 1st Publicly Traded Helium Production/Exploration Company Takes Action with Funding Secured and Permitting Initiated for Near-Term Project,"With an extensive portfolio encompassing over 1 million acres of helium prospective lands across southern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, Royal Helium Ltd. (RHC.v or RHCCF for US investors) has solidified its position as a frontrunner in the exploration, production, and infrastructure realms of this critical and non-renewable resource.

**Canada's Trailblazer in Helium Production on the Public Market**

As the first publicly traded helium producer in Canada, RHC has made significant strides in bringing the wealth-creation potential of helium to the public. The Steveville project, nestled in Southeast Alberta and wholly owned by RHC's subsidiary, Imperial Helium Ltd, marks the genesis of commercial production for the company.

The state-of-the-art Steveville Purification Facility, commissioned in 2023 and operational since November of the same year, epitomizes RHC's commitment to excellence. With a focus on recovering 99.999% helium and adhering to stringent environmental standards, this facility underscores RHC's dedication to sustainability and efficiency in helium extraction.

**Near-term Projects and Development Schedule**

With projects such as Climax, Val Marie, Ogema, and 40 Mile on the horizon, RHC's development schedule paints a picture of steady progress and expansion. By bringing on a total of 39 wells through 2030, RHC aims to solidify its position as a key player in North America's helium landscape while continually advancing reserves and exploring new geographic domains.

**News for the 40 Mile Project**

Historical flow and composition tests at the 7,000-acre 40 mile project showed excellent flow and grade, notably, more than 2X that of Steveville. The original show-well's outcomes rival some of the most significant Cambrian helium discoveries in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana. Despite this, the company operating 40 Mile at the time was focused on natural gas, so the well was shut in. RHC wants to retest it and is optimistic about its helium potential. 

Today, RHC confirmed that it has begun licensing and permitting process for Forty Mile's 'Forty Mile #1' exploratory helium well. Following comprehensive seismic assessments, Royal has identified multiple drill targets spanning Devonian and Cambrian horizons, with plans to delve into the Precambrian crystalline basement. With a strategic focus on targeting multiple zones, Royal aims to unlock the full potential of the Forty Mile project, setting the stage for further development and growth. 

Moreover, yesterday RHC disclosed the successful closing of its $6 million bought-deal public offering. The net proceeds from this offering will be allocated towards the planned high-impact drilling initiatives at Forty Mile, signaling the company's commitment to leveraging its resources for continued exploration and advancement in the helium sector.

2. https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-helium-announces-closing-6-141300253.html

**Transitioning to an Industrial Gas Powerhouse**

Beyond helium exploration, RHC is on the cusp of transitioning into a junior industrial gas player, which would allow for multiple cash flow streams with minimal additional capital expenditure requirements. The company's commitment to emissions efficiency is exemplified by the Steveville Helium Plant, which is projected to earn $3-6M per year in carbon credits.

**A Strategic Approach to Asset Advancement**

With a market capitalization of $57.4M and an enterprise value of $84.9M, RHC stands as a beacon of opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the helium market. Boasting 1,000,000 acres of helium rights, 30+ seismic drill targets, and 16 distinct project areas, RHC is poised for exponential growth in the coming years.

RHC's approach to advancing helium assets is both methodical and pragmatic. From subsurface analysis to the initiation of off-take agreements and the construction of purification facilities, the company's roadmap for success is straightforward, effective, and repeatable.

Royal Helium Ltd.'s journey from exploration to production represents a triumph of innovation, perseverance, and forward-thinking. As the company continues to chart new territories and redefine industry standards, it stands poised to leave an indelible mark on Canada's helium sector while shaping the future of global energy production.

1414,"CPI Week Approaches… 5-10-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures Futures Weekly Market Analysis","The bulls completely ran away with this week with a very impressive 7 day long squeeze. We now head into the all so important CPI week. I will have a very detailed CPI analysis up Tuesday night for you guys about where I expect numbers to be… As of right now I am anticipating a COLD CPI which will likely bring ATHs to this market next week.

https://preview.redd.it/88mrg38zqnzc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab9162f55b1dd49320b2060ff8c265efd8b8ae9

We actually have a pretty solid week of data… we have JPOW scheduled to speak at a banking conference on Tuesday at 10am which will be very interesting being the fay before CPI… We also will get PPI before CPI this time. Generally PPI is the day after CPI… This will give us a nice heads up of what CPI likely comes in at.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/6hbvaykzqnzc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca7454c96239bc8c2c3bb961cfbecc4b8442e196

On the weekly timeframe here we are actually forming a pretty impressive bull flag. If I am correct and CPI comes in COLD next week we will likely see a breakout of this bull flag to the upside which will start the next major leg up on this market.

Right now on SPY we have critical resistance at weekly supply (from ATHs) of 523.21. WE have weekly buyers now for the first time in a month.

Bulls need to break through 523.21 and CLOSE over it next week to then target a bigger breakout to 530+.

The bears will attempt to reject this 523.21 supply and close back under weekly 8ema support of 511.42 to then target a bigger drop to 494.86 demand.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.21  
Demand- 494.86

Similar here on ES we have stronger weekly buyers finally. I still see the same major weekly bull flag here with a strong support bounce off the weekly 8ema support at 5163 this week.

Bulls need to break through and close over ATHs supply of 5307 to then target a bigger breakout to 5400 and signal the next major leg up in this bull market.

Bears will look to double top next week to put in a new supply and target a closure under 5163.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307  
Demand- 5000

Now I have been saying that tech continues to be the laggard this week and throughout this 7 day bull run. Not surprisingly here we do NOT have stronger weekly buyers on QQQ. I, however, do see the same weekly bull flag that appears to be breaking out to the upside as you can see.

Bulls need to breakout here and target a bigger move to close over ATHs supply of 446.38 which then opens a bigger breakout to 460.

Bears need to close out a weekly double top to put in a lower high supply and then close under weekly 8ema support of 435.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 446.38  
Demand- 414.4

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

Much like the others NQ is holding and bouncing off weekly 8ema support of 18006. However, like QQQ we do NOT have stronger weekly buyers yet. NQ continues to be (and tech) the reason this market hasn’t pushed back to ATHs already. Right now there appears to be a sector rotation outta big tech.

Bulls need to break out and close over ATHs supply of 18569 to then target a bigger move to 19000.

Bears have an opportunity to close out a double top on the weekly to then close back under weekly 8ema support of 18006.

NQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 18569

This was a really great week of trading for me.

I made a mistake today that almost cost me but in the end was a happy accident for me. I got a notification that one of my old failed MFFU accounts renewed (forgot to cancel since I already have 3). Well I said okay ill just short the new account with two NQ cons and try to pass it today if we dump (again been bearish waiting for the bigger sell off). Well to my surprise im looking at my accounts about 30 minutes later after my eval was up 50 pts and I noticed my eval was sitting at $0 and my funded account was up… I realized my major mistake and sold on the retrace for about 25 pts. Was a major win but man that could have been bad if I was wrong. Even without that major win though this has been a great week of trading for me and really a great month of trading.

Slow and steady continues to win the race. I am really enjoying also taking one trade in one account at a time. One of the reason I am doing so well trading the last month is that we are really in a nice mean reversion trading cycle right now. I do not enjoy trading major breakout and squeezes. Extreme momentum days are my kryptonite but trading smaller and tighter ranges like this is exactly what I love to do.

1417,Biden to raise EV and Solar tariffs -> $FSLR!,"I don't understand why everyone is looking at the headline ""U.S. to Announce New Tariffs on Chinese Electric Vehicles"" and the takeaway is that you should be buying TSLA? No. Who has actually seen a Chinese EV in the United States? Exactly. They do not exist. So the headline of 100% tariffs on EVs from China is absolutely meaningless. The real substance to these tariffs are the things the United States actually imports. So if domestic EV makers really aren't being hurt by Chinese imports then who are?

So let's look and see who actually stands to benefit from this? Looking back, Biden in 2022 introduced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and one key part of that was tax credits for domestically manufactured solar panels. These credits which are called 45X tax credits \[1\] provide credits for clean energy components domestically produced. So this on paper seems like a boom for domestic solar manufactures.

Now, let's talk tariffs. As we all know Trump loved his Chinese tariffs which included solar panels in 2018, and Biden after taking office decided to extend them in 2022. However, as part of that extension Biden also provided an exemption for Bifacial Solar Panels, which at that time only accounted for a small percentage of the imported solar panels to the United States. Fast forward two years and bifacial solar panels account for 97% of imported solar panels. So today we have 14.25% tariffs on solar panels and 0% on bifacial solar panels due to the exemption. Well again 97% of the imports are bifacial (see Reuters link dated Apr 25 below). So if solar companies can get additional tariffs and new tariffs for bifacial panels they stand to print money hand over fist, they become a monopoly effectively. In 2024 First Solar will receive over a billion dollars in cash from the US government for simply running their business \[4\].

So what was the catalyst for this change? Well the First Solar (FSLR) CEO Mark Widmar. Mark has been lobbying congress and the Biden administration for nearly two years for these tariffs. And I can assure you Tuesday is going to be a celebratory day for Mr. Widmar. As recently as Mar 12th 2024, Mark Widmar CEO of First Solar gave testimony before congress \[2\]. As a result of this there was a bipartisan push for additional solar tarrifs, on January 30th senators Ossof, Brown, Rubio, and Warnock urged the Biden administration to increase solar tarrifs \[3\]. Again this was drafted by both democrat and republican senators, so the likelihood of losing these tariffs if Trump came back is slim to none, especially when Trump has talked of even more aggressive tariffs.

Not to beat a dead horse but a simple google search will reveal how long First Solar (FSLR) has been pushing for this. So I think it's pretty obvious that they are the ones who stand to benefit from this and not EV makers. So for every idiot you see mention TSLA or RIVN, ask them: How many Chinese EVs have you actually seen? And then maybe you will all see how congress makes money trading, they distract you with bullshit headlines meanwhile they trade the footnotes and make a killing.

Read these references and if you disagree...well then you my friend are a true regard.

1434,Europlasma - Some facts,"# Europlasma (#1EZ0)– yet remains largely unknown to the masses, but is already the new big stock for the german Wallstretbets.

# The Basics

1. **Industrial Recycling:**
   * Their core business revolves around recycling and sustainability. They’re not just another “green” company; they’re the rocket fuel of recycling.
   * Their expertise lies in innovative nano-coating solutions, which they develop using proprietary processes. These solutions are based on low-pressure plasma technology, making them cutting-edge and environmentally friendly.

# The Strategic Move: Forge de Tabes

Now, let’s zoom in on Forge de Tabes, the French company that they acquired. This move is like finding a rare Pokémon card in your childhood collection – it’s a game-changer.

1. Forge de Tabes specializes in the production of **155mm artillery shells**. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill shells; they’re the munition for French Caesar artillery guns used by various armed forces, including the Ukrainian military.
2. These 155mm shells pack a punch. They’re NATO-standard caliber and find their place in field guns, howitzers, and gun-howitzers.
3. **Strategic Significance:**
   * By acquiring Forge de Tabes, they gains a foothold in the defense industry. These artillery shells are essential for national security and military operations.

# The Alpha Blue Ocean Connection

1. **Alpha Blue Ocean:**
   * Alpha Blue Ocean recently invested 30 million € in this Company, sparking excitement among investors. Their intentions remain shrouded in mystery, but one thing’s clear: They see potential.

# The Risks and Rewards

1. **Risks:**
   * They operates in a niche market. While this can be advantageous, it also means limited liquidity and potential volatility.
   * The defense industry isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Contracts can be complex, and geopolitical factors play a significant role.
2. **Rewards:**
   * If they successfully leverages Forge de Tabes and its plasma expertise, it could become a powerhouse.
   * The joint purchasing agreement with the EU to supply ammunition to Ukraine adds another layer of potential growth.

# Conclusion

Whether it becomes a star or fades into obscurity remains uncertain.

*Disclaimer: This analysis is not financial advice. Always consult a professional financial advisor before making investment decisions.*

summerize: Chinese Gov will be pumping Chinese stock with their policy

----End of Facts, here is my opinion----

If you read the facts, and try to connect the dots. What do you see? Here is my thoughts.

Ken knows Yellen is going to China in person so he raises concern about National debt. Once Yellen gets to China and wants China to buy US bond (debt) or at least, stop selling US bonds.

IF Chinese gov agrees, Yellen offers foreign investments to assist China's recovery. Of course, Yellen would pick HongKong stock market as it has been the worst performance in the past year.

Stock 101 tell me, buy low sell high, and HongKongis well positioned.

If you remember, literally all US stocks were tanking during that period from April.11~19th, but recovers as assuming other HF brought it back up. And the funds sold are used to invest in HongKong stocks. I am not saying Yellen did it, but i do not rule out related HFs. (check youtube, there are some weird looking HF reps promoting HongKong market)

IF you look at FXI (US ETF tracking HongKong 50 largest cap), it has been trying to break out in the first Q and finally after Yellen's visit to China, HongKong stock index ticker ^hsi has been breaking out into a bull-run.

Now, it may be a bit early to call it a bull run, but identifying it early on gets the most out of it. If my theories landed on the right track, Chinese and US governments are pumping HongKong stock market. At least someone is(are). After all, most of the HongKong large cap companies are below 50% of its former glory some even at 30% which sets up the perfect position as US market is over-brought and HongKong market is over-sold.

--crazy idea---

Correct me if I am wrong, YINN is an ETF like SPY, its value goes up when people buy its share and goes down when people sell.

Since this ETF tracks HongKong stocks, it will reset everyday and increase/decrease base on the % in HongKong market close. Let say HongKong stocks goes up 1%, which FXI will increase 1% AND YINN will increase 3%. *note: its gain/loss is compounded*

Here is the big question. IF people start buying YINN and pump it up to $100 per share and assuming the HongKong bull run is real, wouldn't everyday be like earning call for YINN? Since if its really a bull run, wouldn't the up sides out-weight the down sides which in short, everyone makes money during the bull run, except the bears.

How do I know if I am early or late? I check the yahoo chat room on YINN/FXI, its dead empty. and I think I might be the only regard to come up with this stupid idea and something feels wrong.

Now i finished writing my thoughts, I assume Monday open, YINN and FXI will start green like how bull run should be. There will be down days, that's how they attract foreigner investors to invest.

1456,"SPY Closes a Historical 8 Red Days in a Row… 5-13-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","6 months ago we put in our first 7 green trading days in a row since October 2022 and Friday marked 7 green trading days in a row. I continue to be impressed by this low volume and bullish trend. It would appear that most of the market is just holding and sitting cash until CPI this Wednesday. I am incredibly impressed that by a extremely small 7 cents and waiting until literally the last second that we are seeing our first 8 green days in a row on SPY Since late fall 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/7j6ze8jz390d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03dcfc3339ace91168a002d96672b44299c91e5

Tomorrow we are about to get PPI which will give us a nice preview of the expected COLD CPI.

https://preview.redd.it/24n99eyz390d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ef26c91e9c9046d5fedc6fdfab90e220b62c68

I am actually expecting a cold PPI tomorrow too. Based off the last two years of data MoM CPI has found resistance at 0.6-0.7 and support at -0.5. Since we just hard rejected 0.7 two month ago I am expecting a drop down to 0-0.1%. However, forecast currently is calling for a bounce higher. IF we get LOWER MoM PPI then I expect a big green reaction.

CORE PPI MoM is also hard rejecting its 0.5% resistance of range since 2022 and support is near 0%. Forecast currently sits at 0.2% which is unchanged… 0.2% or lower we are looking at a big green push in market.

Whats truly crazy is that if PPI comes in cold and we close green and then CPI comes in cold and we close green we could see 10 green days in a row…

On Friday we actually put in an imbalanced close on SPY putting in a new supply at 520.25 but closing over it. Remember when we put in a new supply that is resistance and in general we should close below that level. The only way for markets to rebalance is to either close below that supply or close high enough to then turn supply into demand (support).

Currently we put in a new supply and have seen daily buyers weaken. Today also daily buyers weakened again despite making a new high by 3 cents.

I am continually impressed that we have not had a more major sell off yet. I am still looking for the daily 8ema support test near 516.46. My general thought is that we will see a red day tomorrow to find support off the 8ema support. This then sets us up for a bigger push up off cold CPI to ATHs.

Much like SPY we had an imbalanced close at 5241. With the daily doji I would have expect us to retrace but instead we actually touched Fridays HOD and perfectly rejected. We also have weaker daily buyers here on ES.

I am still expecting a flush here back to daily 8ema support near 5205.

On Qs we also had an imbalanced closed on Friday with a new supply being put in at 441.14 but closing higher. We are also seeing no stronger daily buyers despite continuing to push higher. However, here on QQQ we put in a new demand today to turn supply into demand (support) and rebalance QQQ. However, we are making a higher high without proper buying support. This hammer candle should lead to a drop and closure under 442 tomorrow.

In general I am looking for the daily 8ema support to be tested near 438.63. Before reaching ATHs after CPI.

Very similarly here on NQ we had an imbalanced close at 18223 with that new supply. However, on NQ we actually saw STRONGER daily buyers today which is the only one to see that. Which makes a lot of sense as NQ refused to be bearish almost all day and in my opinion is what prevented the market from dropping today. However, due to after hours trading on Nq we do not have a new demand (supply into demand) which means NQ is still imbalanced for the time being.

Bears will look to retest daily 8ema support near 18125 before heading to ATHs.

Todays price action was straight brutal to trade. I was looking for the breakdown that did eventually come, however, NQ hunted me before I was able to get profits. Just a tough day of choppy price action especially on NQ. I mean we only saw a total range of 30pts on ES and 108pts on NQ going into power hour. Its really hard to win when the play is the right one but it just doesn’t move. Best play of the day was my last two shorts which I closed seconds before the bigger drop. Its so mentally exhausting being in a play for an hour watching it bounce from red to green and still holding for conviction to your target.

With a focus on critical minerals such as titanium, iron, and vanadium, crucial for ensuring mineral independence, Temas Resources (Ticker: TMAS.c or TMASF for US investors) is actively exploring advanced projects in Quebec.

TMAS's La Blache and Lac Brule Iron-Titanium-Vanadium projects benefit from Quebec's favorable mining conditions and access to a deep-water port on the St. Lawrence River. 

Moreover, La Blache is projected to have a net present value of $6.6 billion and yield 660,000 tons of Titanium Dioxide annually over a 14-year mine life.

TMAS is also employing advanced processing techniques and patented leaching technologies to minimize environmental impact and carbon emissions. 

One notable innovation is its patented ORF chloride leaching technology, developed in partnership with the University of Minnesota. This technology offers cost-effective and environmentally friendly benefits, reducing processing costs by up to 65% and recycling over 95% of reagents.

On Friday, TMAS closed the second and final tranche of its oversubscribed private placement raising aggregate gross proceeds of $531k to advance its exploration programs.

1485,The Next Big Long: $BOWL,"The Next Big Long: $BOWL

Feel bad you have missed out on the recent pandemonium amongst WSB’s favorite shit stocks? 

Meet $BOWL.  20.7 million share float, of which 14 million shares are shorted. With a 72.4% short interest, BOWL boasts a 8-9% fee to borrow shares. 

Utilization is already at 99%, and after the recent events this week in a myriad of stocks whose names shall not be mentioned, BOWL seems poised to be the next big long. 

As for what they do, $BOWL is the owner and operator of many a bowling lanes across the country. Who doesn’t love bowling? Imagine how many times you could go bowling if this thing 🚀. 


As an aside, so many shares are shorted that institutional ownership of the stock is listed on yahoo finance as 113%. How is this possible? This is only possible for one of two reasons: 

1. The data was reported in error

2. So many shares are short that synthetic shares are created thus wrongly implying institutions own more than the float itself. Imagine said scenario; 

Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.


So, whose ready to knock down some fucking short pins?",1715697093,825363,sa1622,t2_x2ikw,ef0ae7ca28930b22a172eaa833b9b61e064d84ea4cbdf333fefabcaddbd08e34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1crtloa/the_next_big_long_bowl/

1507,"Bulls Make a Historical 9 Green Day Long Run Into CPI… 5-14-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I have been doing this for quite a some time now… and I am pretty well adversed to the fact that “the market is going to market” but I have got to say this 9 day long bull run is one of the most criminal things I have ever seen. The last 4 days of trading from a macro stand point (especially today) make absolutely no sense… the start of this 9 days made 100% sense as the VIX got majorly crushed and we rocketed off that. I can get on board with a sick short squeeze to the upside.

According to ChatGPT (Thanks FRENCH!) the last time the S&P500 saw this many green closes in a row was March/ April 1971 where it closed 14 consecutive green days in a row. That makes this the second longest green run in the history of the stock markets (at least since 1971).

However, today made ZERO sense. We got WAY hotter than forecasted and previous PPI (inflation data) data this morning at 830a. However, markets initially correctly reacted with a huge wick to the downside… only to instantly get bought up and never see that low again. Now sometimes his makes sense because the VIX is so pumped going into data that unless its wildly bad we crush the VIX and rally anyways. However, that was not what we had today. Honestly I cant really explain todays movement. This is setting up and incredibly wild day tomorrow.

Based off Bloomberg, Cleveland fed and forecast this is our expected range for CPI tomorrow.

My Prediction  
CPI YoY: 3.6% (miss)  
CPI MoM: 0.5% (miss)  
CORE YoY: 3.8% (unchanged)  
CORE MoM: 0.4% (unchanged)

I actually going into this CPI was pretty bullish and thinking that we would get a COLD CPI which would take us to ATHs… However, now the data is pointing to a more neutral/ HOT CPI Tomorrow. However, like we saw with PPI today… is the market even going to care?

https://preview.redd.it/cocu2s9xbg0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad22c5f184b3ec783eea7fed0980c705b5cb31f4

Since December 2023 any time PPI has come in HIGHER than estimates we have also seen CPI come in HIGHER than estimates also… that means for CPI YoY tomorrow we should expect a 3.5% minimum number which would leave CPI YoY unchanged… there is no way that the fed can even remotely justify or explain that we will get 3 rate cuts in 2024 with CPI unchanged… Honestly I have been saying it since December 2023… we are NOT getting rate cuts this year UNLESS something breaks in a major way… we actually could easily see a rate HIKE in 2024 at the pace we are at…

https://preview.redd.it/m7zndecybg0d1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e8d97155b7c69f55568eeaae219059eaaf26e5

We are also seeing an estimation at 3.6% for CORE YoY… IF we use the variation of 0.1% like we had on PPI then we should see CORE YoY come in at 3.7% tomorrow. This would be a small BEAT.

https://preview.redd.it/5i5vufoybg0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca13ad8679d62a67193637f06645acd9f320af0

I have a feeling that tomorrow we could easily see HOT CPI data and still see a new ATHs…

**SPY DAILY**

Whats even wilder is that SPY is about $1 from ATHs as we head into the most important CPI data day in a long time. Its very possible markets will see a new ATH tomorrow despite hotter inflation data that signals no rate cuts. SPY closed just below its critical 523.45 double confirmed supply.

Bulls will look for a breakout to ATHs and target a closure in the 530s.

Bears need to minimally close under todays demand of 520.82.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 518.01 -> 523.45  
Demand- 520.82

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Futures also turned previous supply into demand and also had daily buyers today. Now the chart we see right now is NOT what we saw at open… for most of the day we were not seeing stronger daily buyers which is very interesting as they once again came in very late to the day. Today is another very low volume day overall too hitting about 65% of the 30 day average volume today.

Bulls will target ATHs tomorrow of 5333.5 and a closure over 5309 supply.

Bears will look to close under todays demand of 5239.

Supply- 5266 -> 5309

Much like SPY we are pushing up and nearing our ATHs here with only about $3 to go to reach 449.34. We are coming into our major double supply of 445.36-446.44.

If the bulls can break through this level here then we should realistically look for a closure in the 450s tomorrow.

Bears minimally will look to close under yesterdays demand of 442.

Nq also turned supply into demand today and was the main leader of upside support with stronger daily sellers for the 2^(nd) day in a row now. NQ remains about 250 pts from ATHs as it has a much larger wick the day we hit ATHs compared to ES.

Bulls will look to break through 18489-18582 tomorrow and target a move to 19000 by EOW.

Bears need to minimally close under 18234 demand.

Truthfully I am not too proud to admit that today got the best of me. I truly in no world believed we would get a HOT PPI data AND still close green for the 9^(th) day in a row leading into one of the most important data points we have gotten recently… And honestly I just couldn’t see anything but shorts. I just kept waiting for something to come that never came.

In the end though its not for nothing.

I did lose one funded account which I took an early payout in this week so it barely had $400 of drawdown left…

I had another account that was slightly down and that got burnt trying to be patient and waiting for a short to play out (it did eventually pay out but it did not come quick enough).

The funded account I made $108 in today I will be requesting a pay out in tonight.

My APEX account thankfully ended up only down $300 which I already requested one payout in and will request another payout in tomorrow. APEX payout windows run the 15^(th)-20^(th).

I also was able to pass two more EVALS on MFFU today to replace my lost funded. In the end not a total loss but it is what it is.

Tomorrow plan honestly is to not even convert over my two MFFU funded accounts and I will just be trading my APEX. Today I abandoned my strategy and thought I could force trades. It cost me some but it could have been much much worse. I am going to regather tomorrow and also avoid risking trading on CPI day by only trading my APEX account which has a major cushion.

This was my the worse day I have had in a very long time… it sucks but in the end it’s a learning experience.",1715718514,825516,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,cdd2ddbee6ae64e9268dcbe076171d596ac0a9aa13c7f99677634a6db2624e4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1cs2ahi/bulls_make_a_historical_9_green_day_long_run_into/

1553,"Cold CPI Takes Markets to a New ATH… 5-15-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","If you missed it we ended up getting a decently colder than expected (forecasted) and previous CPI.

https://preview.redd.it/t528hw9ven0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=40543f595ffd27fb9178487d84334d83770f7dca

I mentioned on Monday that IF we got a cold PPI and CPI we could and very well would see markets hit ATHs by the end of the week. Despite a hotter than expected PPI yesterday on the backs of this cold CPI we are seeing markets rally near ATHs.

Now the question is where do we go next… we are already at 10 green days in a row and now not only that but all the big data is really out of the way until FOMC in June.

I will personally say that while I still think and have said since December 2023 there is no way we get a rate cut in 2024… that a 0.1% drop in inflation in no way shows the fed has inflation under control and I would be shocked if JPOW said it gave them confidence to cut…

However, that doesn’t matter… what matters is that this gives the market confidence that inflation is coming down… they don’t care if its by 0.1% or 10%... it came down… honestly there is nothing left right now to drop this market… truly I don’t see a reason until at least FOMC to be bearish.

If you think about it from a daily/ weekly time line we had a major backtest of support and EMAs and now we are back at ATHs and honestly we are likely looking at the start of the next breakout in the markets.

Remember just because we hit ATHs doesn’t mean we have to short it… just because we are at a historical 10 green days in a row doesn’t mean tomorrow has to be red…

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/yfjlsqpven0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d8b4cdafab6441b2d536c51cb8042af9d79446

SPY has officially made a new ATHs today. What is very important to note here is that not only do we have proper stronger buyers to support that ATH today but we are also officially strongly back in extreme daily BULL momentum.

With the gap up and breakout over 523.45 reconfirmed supply and breakout to ATHs we are stating our next bull channel and breakout here.

Bulls will target a move to 535-540 next. Any and all red days should realistically be seen as a dip buying opportunity. I would NOT be bearish at all until we closed a daily candle below the daily 20ema which currently sits at 515.04.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.45  
Demand- 520.82

**ES FUTURES DAILY**



https://preview.redd.it/88et4d9wen0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d842a3be2e8aa695356cfef0c3d457822eb07ff

We are also seeing a major breakout here on ES over previous reconfirmed supply and range resistance of 5309. This realistically after a backtest and bounce off daily 100ema support is our bull market breakout. I will be targeting a move to 5400 into the EOM. I again would not remotely be bearish or even think about shorts long term until we break and close under 5239.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5309  
Demand- 5239

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/jcug6yvwen0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6c777db65a04d2c1344761f7b4080eeef2b653

QQQ also saw a new ATH put in today with again stronger daily buyers and now extreme daily bull momentum holding strong on the daily timeframe. With this breakout and closure over 445.36-446.44 double supply the bulls have officially not only broken consolidation but we have broken out range that we were watching for the next major breakout.

Bulls are targeting a move to 460 next. Until we realistically close under 442 demand there is no reason to see a red day as anything but a dip buying opportunity.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 445.36 -> 446.44  
Demand- 442

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/3sfhyc7xen0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e67f196862e974e312fd09fe634c6c881d25908

Honestly the fact that SPY, QQQ, and ES all hit ATHs today but NQ fell 2 points short is highly disappointing to me. I do expect it to hit that overnight or tomorrow though.

As NQ breaks out and closes over critical double supply of 18489-18582 we are being properly supported with extreme daily bull momentum and stronger daily buyers.

Bulls next major target is 19000 into EOM. Until we realistically lose 18234 there is no reason to look for a short long term. This is a bull market over all here and honestly this bull market has a lot more to go.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18489 -> 18582

Honestly one of the hardest things to do is bounce back after a terrible day of trading. Today being CPI day and also knowing I had to leave at 11am to take my daughter and wife to the airport I wanted to trade lightly.

I ended up taking a very nice short in my APEX account and then took a long in one of my MFFU accounts in ES and then in another account in NQ. Honestly I was skeptical despite everything data and technical wise supported for the upside at open today. I wish I had help me longs for their full targets but truly I just didn’t have the confidence and after a bad day of trading I wanted to bounce back.

I ended up not being able to find a trade for my 4^(th) account before I had to leave.

I did end up assuming we would see ES and NQ push for ATHS today so before I left at 11 I ended up longing two NQ cons for a new 50k MFFU eval. This was a great play and now I will have a backup funded account for MFFU ready to go. I don’t plan to need that for a long time but as long as I can have a backup no reason not to use a day like today to pass it.",1715804241,825818,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,e3cff74079c617b91d6fc2b89e9a140d8aa11d251779fec4dbeb60952681728e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1csunj3/cold_cpi_takes_markets_to_a_new_ath_51524_spy_es/

Sojitz Corporation and Ginkgo Bioworks Announce Plans to Use Synthetic Biology R&D Services to Accelerate Sustainable Manufacturing in Japan

Sojitz Corporation and Ginkgo will collaborate in a joint business development effort to offer Ginkgo's R&D services to Japanese customers. Sojitz believes Ginkgo's unique synthetic biology research and development services will appeal to customers within the Japanese bioeconomy that are looking to replace petroleum and chemical-based manufacturing processes with bio-based ones.



The Japanese government has formulated a Bioeconomy Strategy that envisions a $837 billion (USD) bioeconomy, and is looking to develop biotechnology applications across industries as it pursues its climate commitments to reach net zero by 2050. Ginkgo hopes to apply its platform in support of the Japanese biotech ecosystem to accelerate progress to achieving this vision.



Koji Izutani, Managing Executive Officer, Sojitz: ""We are pleased to introduce Ginkgo's technology to Japanese companies that have a desire to reduce their carbon footprint and develop sustainable fermentation processes. We are confident that Ginkgo's expertise in synthetic biology and the breadth of its technology platform can be used to transform processes across various Japanese industries, including industrial biotechnology.""



Ena Cratsenburg, Chief Business Officer, Ginkgo: ""We're thrilled to join efforts with Sojitz and collaborate on bolstering the Japanese bioeconomy. Sojitz is a well respected trading company that has extensive relationships with many of the major industrial and chemical companies in Japan. We look forward to working with Japanese companies to leverage our synthetic biology platform to accelerate the development and launch of bio-based and sustainable products in Japan.""



Ginkgo's co-founder, Tom Knight, will present at the SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 conference on May 15th at 12pm Japan Standard Time, where he will further discuss the collaboration with Sojitz.

1571,How to get a passive income? $4000 a month,"Hi, I want to share a leak I learned about in the closed community.

This method is quite simple but extremely effective. It involves the **MEXC** exchange and the **EOS** coin (you can learn more about it on CoinMarketCap).

The method revolves around using an old EOS listing address that compensated users with a percentage of the commission (initially, the exchange set too high a commission for each transaction on the EOS network, and in order not to lose potential investors, EOS reduced the percentage using their own funds). The listing passed, and EOS changed the cold address to a hot one, which does not provide such an opportunity. But the joke is that if we use the cold address, it will bring us a profit of **0.5%**. It's a small percentage, but with compound interest, you can earn a decent amount of money.

**How to do it?**

**1)** Buy a EOS coin

**2)** Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased EOS

**3)** Select Deposit and copy MEMO (Digits)

**4)** Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: EOS
* Address: testnet
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

**5)** Choose a small amount of coins for the test

**6)** And after ±10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only +0.5% (in coins)

**MEMO** - It's your wallet ID, so it needs to be entered every time!

**Careful!**

* Do no more than 20-30 transactions per day because MEXC may block you for a while due to suspicious activity, and you will just lose time

**Additionally:**

* This one can be automated, I have already realized it, and I am ready to sell the script cheaper than the market! So you don't have to do everything by hand.
* If anyone wants the original post or video tutorial, I can drop it on PM",1715865220,825948,Cherilyn_Leep,t2_t4efurc7,7d676e5257c014d179c750098ffa7fb0d64888c8e1cf6fd020025ea7727e76e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ctclse/how_to_get_a_passive_income_4000_a_month/
1572,CDZI on Track for More Gains - Here's Why,"**Good morning everyone** - Sharing some updated insights on CDZI today. We've seen a commendable surge of over 20% since our last touchpoint, and the outlook continues to look promising. Here's why I'm eyeing a target of $2.95 & $3.04 for our next milestones. Communicated disclaimer, not financial advice

**Why CDZI Could Climb Higher:**

* **Recent Trading Activity:** Just yesterday, CDZI closed at $2.80 and even hit $2.87 after hours, signaling robust buying interest and ongoing momentum which might extend into the upcoming sessions.
* **Industry Dynamics:** As part of the stable Utilities—Regulated Water sector, CDZI recently secured a substantial $5.2 million contract, suggesting scope for operational growth and more revenue.
* **Insider Buying:** Notably, there's been hefty buying from the CEO—her moves reflect strong belief in CDZI's prospects, potentially boosting investor confidence.
* **Technical Indicators:** The stock is performing well above recent lows with solid trading volume, indicating healthy investor interest. Despite some financial challenges, the mix of strong insider activity and positive market dynamics points to potential price gains.

**Next price targets:**

$2.95 & $3.04

**Wrapping Up:**  
Despite some underlying challenges like negative EPS and high debt, the blend of strong market sentiment, insider buys, and recent upbeat developments makes CDZI a stock to watch closely in the short term.

1583,Can someone explain why FFIE is still trading? ,"So recently there’s been people here talking fervently about YOLOs in FFIE, which designs and produces electric cars. I managed to take a look at how the company is doing; apparently, the stock itself is in imminent danger of being delisted from NASDAQ due to alleged non-compliance: 

‘The Company intends to request a hearing to appeal the Delisting Determination by May 1, 2024, the latest date permitted, which will stay the suspension of the Company’s securities for 15 days from the date of the request, during which time the Company’s securities will continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company also intends to request an extended stay of the suspension pending such hearing with Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel.

If the Company fails to appeal the Delisting Determination by May 1, 2024, trading of the Company’s common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on May 3, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.’

Source: https://investors.ff.com/news-releases/news-release-details/faraday-future-announces-nasdaq-delisting-determination-and

So by right, since the stock is still trading right now, on the 17th of May, does that mean that they have successfully requested an extended stay of suspension? If so, how long will this extended stay last and how would it affect the overall stock price?

It’s the demise of not only the market, but our society as a whole. I commend those who are holding the so called “meme stocks” (I won’t mention cause you know which ones they are, take a peak at the float and short interest). Some may think it’s for gains (and yes that is a part of the equation cause we invest now to better our future) but ultimately it’s a fight against people who think they can take advantage of those who are much less fortunate and not in the top 1%. I know it make seem bleak at times and we’ve seen the same story unfold time and time again… but there’s a point where enough is enough.

1592,"Bears End The Green Streak… 5-16-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","After 10 days of green in a row and full strength from the bulls we finally saw the bears with a little bit of strength today. Tomorrow is Friday and we have historically had some miserable trading days on Fridays. We also have monthly OPEX tomorrow which will add to the miserableness of it.

SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/gziq9u9phu0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2ca7610a0366f399325b0def6e29d468436c58

Bears put in just enough of a move today to get a new daily supply at 529.76. This doji daily double top opens up a major opportunity for the bears tomorrow.

We remain in extreme bull momentum and we continue to have stronger daily buyers.

Bulls will be targeting its next breakout to 535.

Bears need to close under 529.76 to then target 523.45.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.45 -> 429.76  
Demand- 520.82

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/98bhieophu0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=253221e207d99c9cbf82982241b247d63db1f7d6

We did get the nice doji potential reversal candle here on ES too. We again remain in extreme bull momentum despite a new supply being put in at 5330. Today on Es we did see daily buyers finally weaken.

Bulls need to hold here and breakout to 5375.

Bears will target a retest of previous supply/ support of 5309.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5309  
Demand- 5239

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/db2aoj1qhu0d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b424e1e4b9b3c8d6c337041866943ab9aeb7f46

Similar to SPY we are seeing the Qs with a new supply at 452.99. This is with stronger daily buyers and continued extreme bull momentum though. This doji daily candle here could result in a retrace tomorrow but with this buying power and momentum we could easily see bulls push through the bearish technicals.

Bulls will target a breakout to 460.

Bears need to look to retest 445.36-446.44.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 445.36 -> 446.44 -> 452.99  
Demand- 442

Looking at NQ we also got a new supply and we also got a daily double top doji rejection candle here. This new supply at 18699 does open up an opportunity to test previous supplies of 18582-18489 before we push higher. However, extreme daily bull momentum and daily buyers weakening today bulls may struggle tomorrow.  

Bulls need to breakout and target 18900-19000.

Bears will look to back test 18489-18582.

1624,"Weekly Bull Flag Breakout… 5-17-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","We have all officially survived CPI week and now we have FOMC Minutes to look forward to next week. Realistically the way I look at it is that there is nothing major data wise that will help the bears. Outside of an unforeseen event I really do think we are going to be starting the next leg up until FOMC in June.

https://preview.redd.it/0rt81k1tm11d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5cdc27c145fda673bba8ef6836005b3a0d3dbf

Fairly mild data week coming up which is always nice for us traders. Notably we have a ridiculous amount of fed speakers scheduled to speak next week so that is likely to cause some turbulence. As of now JPOW is speaking at college commencement on Sunday (though its pre-recorded now cause he has the VID). Yellen speaks Tuesday at 3am and besides FOMC Minutes Wednesday and UMICH Inflation on Friday we have a nice week ahead of us!

I know a few have asked but I am purposefully not including VIX, 10yr and DXY in my TA anymore. The VIX Is at low enough levels that it is back to being irrelevant. The 10YR and DXY have not correlated in a very long time either. We are in pure price action territory which I love.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/2vz0rbetm11d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dde742b20ef854532307bdaa29f00def2c76a77

Looking at the weekly here on SPY we have for the 2^(nd) week in a row stronger weekly buyers. While the daily timeframe has officially returned to extreme bull momentum the momentum here on weekly is bullish but neutral in extremeness.

With a closure over 523.21 supply from previous ATHS this truly looks like one massive bear flag here. Bears would have needed to hard reject and closed under 523.21 in order to negate the bear flag.

Bulls will look to push to 540-550 into FOMC.

Bears likely will backtest the 523.21 supply next week before we bounce off it and daily 8ema support.

Supply- 523.21

Similarly here on ES we have stronger weekly buyers back to back weeks now. We also broke through critical previous ATHs supply of 5307. I also see a nice bounce for the 2^(nd) week in a row off the weekly 8ema support. This indicates a major breakout is upon us here. On the backs of colder CPI and essentially market thinking the fed will cut rates still we should easily see a breakout into FOMC next month.

Bulls now have a target of 5400-5500 into FOMC.

Bears will look to bounce off weekly 8ema support near 5250 (projected) and defend 5307 support next week.

You can more clearly see the bull flag that I am eyeing on QQQ here and clearly shows a breakout of the flag and also of previous ATHs supply of 446.38. With this resistance broken through here and the first weekly buyers in 5 weeks we are looking at a high probability bullish week ahead. Bulls new targets is 460-470 into FOMC.

Bears will likely get a backtest of the 446.38 supply which is right where weekly 8ema support will be.

Here on NQ you can also see the breakout here. With 18569 being broken through and closed over which is previous ATHs supply/ resistance we are fairly bullish here. We are finally seeing weekly buying support return here to tech also. I am very closely watching for TECH to lead the next leg up. Today and most of this week ES still was the strength.

Bulls will look to break out over 19000 next week and eventually target 19500 into FOMC.

Bears will look to test weekly 8ema support near 18300 (projected) next week.

I have mentioned countless times that I absolutely hate trading Fridays lately. I just feel we are left with some very choppy, tight ranged and hard technical days. I took a loss on a short in ES and NQ to start my day. I was able to bounce back with some shorts on NQ though to close 1 account green and three accounts small red. Overall all 4 of my accounts are finishing in the green this week. I had a bit of a rough start to the week but in the end it turned into another great week of trading.

I look forward to enjoying my weekend and I will see you folks on Monday for Market Talk!

1626,Tisdale Clean Energy's (TCEC.c) Drilling Milestones at the South Falcon East Uranium Project,"Tisdale Clean Energy Corp. (TCEC.c or TCEFF for US investors) recently wrapped up initial drilling activities at the South Falcon East Uranium Project, strategically situated near the renowned Athabasca Basin and the Key Lake Uranium Mill.

**Validating Resource Potential Through Drilling**

TCEC's extensive 2024 drilling initiative, encompassing 1500m across two phases, primarily aims to validate existing mineralization, bolstering confidence in the project's resource potential.

The first drill hole unveiled multiple uranium mineralization zones over a 13.5m depth, showcasing notable outcomes such as 0.03% eU3O8 over 4.1 m, including 0.11% eU3O8 over 0.2 m, emphasizing the potential continuity of mineralization in the project area.

https://preview.redd.it/xih769idk21d1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=00d2b5636852adf8c5c4ceba9b0bbdfab4b5e592

The second drill hole, targeting the extension of mineralization from a historical source, delineated several mineralized zones below 132m, with significant findings like 0.02% U3O8 over 1.3 m, indicating prospects for further expansion.

**Laying the Groundwork for Future Exploration**

Successful drilling not only validates the presence of mineralized pegmatites and paragneiss but also lays a robust foundation for future exploration endeavors aimed at uncovering additional mineralization opportunities.

Samples from the mineralized intervals are presently undergoing comprehensive analysis, with TCEC expected to release detailed results. With plans to resume drilling later this spring, the company maintains an optimistic outlook for discovering further mineralization potential within the South Falcon East Project, supported by its historical inferred mineral resource of 6.9 Mlbs U3O8, indicative of substantial exploration potential.

1639,$Hubc 50$ or more stock,"Hello everyone
In my opinion the investment potential for getting rich is tremendous, full disclosure I have 42k shares at the moment
So where to start? Let's start from the beginning
The company was founded in Israel in 2017 by a company from the military's intelligence and security unit 8200
The company was issued in Israel and in the two and a half years it was there, it increased 10 times to a market value of 160 million dollars, at its peak it also reached a market value of 350 million dollars
The company decided to do an IPO on Nasdaq in 2023, stopped trading in Israel and moved to Nasdaq with a market valuation of 1.2 billion dollars

******The shit that happened in 2023*****
1.The former CEO who was fired and replaced is suspected of embezzling money from the company, later it was learned that he took $300k for renovations to his house, the idiot caused the share price to plummet quickly, and he did me a favor that I bought cheap, you will soon know why
2.It turns out that the chief financial officer turned a blind eye to this, and did not ensure that reports were issued on time, therefore the pressure increased as the share price fell
3.The thieving CEO was removed from his position, and replaced by a new manager named Uzi Moskovitz, basically a failed manager who made a bad loan deal for dimes, and this was also before the sudden drop in prices
4.The company's reports still haven't arrived, according to the date of November 2023 and in addition there is a deletion warning in Nasdaq because the price has been trading below the dollar for some time

So much for the bad news that the company caused her

####But the worse news, that algo hedge funds that take advantage of the lack of volume in the share price, every day made sure to lower the price by about 10 percent by taking advantage of the lack of volume in the share, in addition they took shares to short in the dark pool 2 times or more than the shares that exist in the market for trading (even today 3 million  Stocks in short out of 4.8 in the float, a delusional ratio of bad manipulation by the crocodiles of Wall Street###
This algo made tens of millions of dollars from this exploit

--------Now for the good news in the last six months, and why I think this is an opportunity to get rich quickly in the near term-----
1.The manager of the company was replaced, a bright young man, and a wizard at closing deals
His name is Noah Hershkovitz
This man was at A-labs managed 700 million dollars in funds and is well connected with the most powerful people in the market
2.When he took office, he brought new contracts for 40 million dollars with cooperation with a private Ai company called Blacksuan Technologies, the deals included cyber protection for central banks in Europe and the world
3.Fired the stupid finance person who showed up, and brought in someone elite to sort out the company's reports and its activities
The reports for H1 2023 came out, and there were revenues of 36 million dollars, if expenses of almost 80 million, one of the reasons for the Nasdaq IPO, which is a one-time expense that cost approximately 40 million dollars
4.Noah made a decision to do a reverse split in the share price, and returned it to trade at $2, and reduced the shares from 98 million to 9.8 million shares
On the day of the split, Noah issued an announcement about a large deal with one of the largest defense agencies in Israel, Elbit, Rafael, the details of the deal are unknown due to the need for discretion
5.The share price continues to fall to the illusory value of 8 million dollars, because of the algo that takes advantage of the lack of volume and intentionally damages the price and makes money at the expense of the little people, like me and you
6.In April 2024, an announcement was made that hubc bought qpoint for $26 million, a company from Israel that brings in $29 million a year and has key people from all hi-tech fields
This is a joke, a company we purchased for 26 million dollars is worth 3 times our current value, mainly because we are already 4 companies
Hub Cyber,ald,comsec,qpoint

And There is talk of a merger of Blackswan, which is a private company that brings in 40 million dollars a year

In short, a huge opportunity for small investors to get rich overnight, a company that brings in 100 to 150 million dollars a year, whose market value is 8 million dollars

In addition, the most important thing now, the reports of 20-f 2024 should have been released by May 15 according to the law, they were not released, not because the company cannot provide, because of inside information that needs to be released, in my opinion it is something as big as the sale of the company for no less than 500 million dollars or  Merger with Black Seven or other big news

++++Right now I'm losing on paper, and I don't care at all, I found out through my rose-colored glasses, that I'm going to be a millionaire very soon
The elgo that hurts us will be punished very soon
Love you, my bank account

1656,3rd Week Of May Watchlist: $SUUN Pennant Pattern + $GWAV at a critical point after its 400% rise last week (with charts),"I hope everyone had a great and relaxing weekend, but it's time to get back to making plays! $GWAV got really hot towards the end of last week, and it is at a pivotal point to either continue its recent uptrend or start to reverse. $SUUN  highlights a promising growth opportunity in the renewable energy sector and is looking even stronger than $GWAV. If you trade these types of setups, take a look. And remember, the only way to make gains is to take profits :) Let's get into it! 

First up, we have  $SUUN (Solarbank Corp.). This stock has been steadily climbing since its inception, driven by significant developments and strategic initiatives in renewable energy. With the US government heavily investing in clean energy projects, Solarbank Corp. is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company's recent entry into the electric vehicle charger market and participation in IESO’s proposals for 4,000 MW of year-round electricity capacity add to its bullish outlook.

* The chart shows a bullish pennant formation, indicating potential for further upside. Will be watching the trendlines and volume to confirm the breakout
* MACD is crossing upwards on the 4-hour chart, signaling positive momentum.
* Key resistance levels are around $6.30, $6.50, and $7.00. Breaking these could lead to a significant rally and also be good profit-taking levels if you are in this for a swing trade.

Next up, we have $GWAV (Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc.). This stock blew up on Thursday and Friday, and many people were talking about this stock in this sub. The stock flew a total of 400% before retracing at the current trendline. This stock could go either way in the short term, depending on the volume and interest next week. Make sure you keep an eye on this trendline if you are already in!

$GWAV Chart Analysis:

* The chart indicates a bullish trendline support, suggesting the stock may continue its upward trajectory, but if there is little volume next week there is a chance this stock could break below and turn highly bearish.
* MACD on the hourly has a bearish cross, so keep that in mind.
* Watch for support around $0.15 and potential resistance around $0.20. A breakout in either direction is possible, so be prepared

1. Short sellers may continue to sell short at 4 o'clock before the market opens to create fear and make everyone sell stocks at low prices! 



2. Short sellers will drive up the stock price along with retail investors and start smashing the market around noon! 



3. What I hope most is that retail investors hold the stocks and do not sell them, or set the high price they expect! Waiting for a short squeeze. This is the best result!

1659,How to get a passive income? $4000 a month,"Hi, I want to share a leak I learned about in the closed community.

This method is quite simple but extremely effective. It involves the **MEXC** exchange and the **EOS** coin (you can learn more about it on CoinMarketCap).

The method revolves around using an old EOS listing address that compensated users with a percentage of the commission (initially, the exchange set too high a commission for each transaction on the EOS network, and in order not to lose potential investors, EOS reduced the percentage using their own funds). The listing passed, and EOS changed the cold address to a hot one, which does not provide such an opportunity. But the joke is that if we use the cold address, it will bring us a profit of **0.5%**. It's a small percentage, but with compound interest, you can earn a decent amount of money.

**How to do it?**

**1)** Buy a EOS coin

**2)** Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased EOS

**3)** Select Deposit and copy MEMO (Digits)

**4)** Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: EOS
* Address: testnet
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

**5)** Choose a small amount of coins for the test

**6)** And after ±10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only +0.5% (in coins)

**MEMO** - It's your wallet ID, so it needs to be entered every time!

**Careful!**

* Do no more than 20-30 transactions per day because MEXC may block you for a while due to suspicious activity, and you will just lose time

**Additionally:**

* This one can be automated, I have already realized it, and I am ready to sell the script cheaper than the market! So you don't have to do everything by hand.
* If anyone wants the original post or video tutorial, I can drop it on PM",1716194069,826717,Dayana_Fuston,t2_t4ex0uvn,0fc7a3c04399f1ee1ca5c1f0f4ef8bc00206cfc8a7e1cf09e0ca002cd50131f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1cwan4n/how_to_get_a_passive_income_4000_a_month/

1679,FRGGF’s Big Moves: Why You Should Watch This Mining Stock,"**Good morning all and happy Tuesday!** Yesterday I saw a post about FRGGF, so I did a little digging (no pun intended) and discovered that FRGGF was formerly Benjamin Hill Mining Co. Communicated disclaimer, nfa. I couldn’t recall the ticker initially, but I do remember having a successful trade with them in the past.

Here's some recent news and my initial thoughts on the company:

**Firstly:**  
FRGGF seems to be doing everything to find success—both financially and in mining. Recently, they acquired 40% of Aion Mining Corp. (after purchasing 20% in December 2023), and in April they:

* Announced target areas for a drill program starting in spring 2024, with 5 drill holes totaling 2,500 meters, continuing the fall 2023 diamond drilling program.
* Announced the staking of 18 new claim blocks, totaling approximately 376 hectares. The Alotta property now has 96 mineral claims covering about 1,926 hectares.

**Secondly:**  
FRGGF has announced the mobilization of the Alotta project starting May 18th (more info [here](https://www.forgeresourcescorp.com/2024/05/07/forge-resources-announces-mobilization-date-for-spring-drill-program-at-alotta-project/)).

**Thirdly:**  
FRGGF has commenced comprehensive soil studies and pilot drilling at a fully permitted coal project in Colombia.

* ""This marks a significant step forward in our development project, and the comprehensive soil studies and pilot drilling will provide us with crucial insights as we progress towards the next phase of our project."" (read more [here](https://www.forgeresourcescorp.com/2024/05/15/forge-resources-to-commence-comprehensive-soil-studies-and-pilot-drilling-at-fully-permitted-coal-project/), it is quite dense).

**That’s it, folks.** Just wanted to share some updates on a ticker we used to play and had success with in the past.

**Sell/don't buy this stock if:**

* You are concerned about the high dependency on marketing expenses, which are 50% of their costs.
* You are wary of potential market saturation or competition that could limit subscriber growth.

**Highlights**

* Revenue was $278.2 million Q1 2024 compared to $190.8 million Q1 2023, an 46% YoY increase.
* Net income was $11.1 million for Q1 2024 compared to a net loss of $(10.1) million for Q1 of 2023.
   * HIMS is now profitable!
* Monthly Online Revenue per Average Subscriber stayed constant at $55/m, which means HIMS mainly relies on new subscribers coming in and current subscribers retaining.
   * New subscribers jumped 41% YoY

* How effectively they can market & acquire new users for their weight loss drug
* How good their margins are. They sell it for 85% less than the FDA approved drug!

1692,TODAY: LUCA.v Confirms New High-Grade Gold Zones at the Tahuehueto Gold Mine,"LUCA Mining Corp. (Ticker LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors) continues to make significant strides with its Campo Morado and Tahuehueto mine in Mexico which collectively produce a variety of minerals, including gold, copper, zinc, silver, and lead.

The Campo Morado mine, an underground operation in Guerrero State, is situated in a prolific mining area. It primarily produces copper-zinc-lead concentrates with precious metals credits. Recently, the mine has been undergoing an optimization program, which has already resulted in substantial improvements in recoveries, grades, efficiencies, and cash flows.

In Durango State, LUCA's Tahuehueto gold and silver mine, located within the Sierra Madre Mineral Belt, is still under development. This region is known for its numerous producing and historic mines. The company anticipates that its operations will begin generating positive cash flows this year, aligning with its growth strategy aimed at maximizing shareholder returns.

Today, Luca Mining announced a significant milestone at the Tahuehueto Gold Mine, with new high-grade gold mineralization over considerable widths confirmed. This mineralization occurs in shoots branching off the main Creston vein at Underground Level 23, one of the two main structures currently being mined.

Geological mapping and channel sampling at this level have revealed breccia ore shoots up to 20 meters wide, with some channel samples showing gold concentrations greater than 20 grams per tonne (g/t Au).

These wide, high-grade zones were identified in earlier drilling and are part of the company's plan to ramp up production to 1,000 tonnes per day (tpd), a milestone expected to be achieved in the coming months.

The underground development at Tahuehueto has progressed steadily since early 2022, with recent efforts focusing on developing access, dewatering, and mining the first stopes of Level 23.

The pre-feasibility study for Tahuehueto identified maximum vein widths of 8.4 meters in the hanging wall and 6.5 meters in the footwall vein splays on Level 23. Actual vein widths are comparable, with 4.9 meters in the footwall and 9.5 meters in the hanging wall, although detailed vein geometries vary.

The footwall splay has been exposed along a 160-meter strike and shows excellent continuity. 

Channel sampling of the southwestern extent of the vein-breccia zone, about half of the fully exposed footwall splay, indicates an area extending 200 meters laterally by 230 vertical meters based on diamond drilling. This area remains open at depth and to the northeast and southwest, and these targets are included in the ongoing exploration program.

LUCA's latest discoveries at Tahuehueto underline the potential of the mine and the company's commitment to growth and shareholder value. As development continues, Luca Mining remains focused on unlocking the full potential of its assets and delivering significant returns to its shareholders.

1705,"FOMC Minute Review… 5-22-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Bit interesting to see that we rocketed so high on FOMC itself but minutes took us lower… I personally find the way this market picks and chooses to react to certain things to be comical sometimes…

Lets start by taking a look at what was released today from FOMC minutes… remember this is a transcript that details everything discussed at the previous FOMC meeting.

·         Almost all participants supported the decision to begin to slow the pace of decline of the central bank's securities holdings; a few could have supported a continuation of the current pace.

·         Couple of participants said it would be useful to begin discussions of appropriate longer-run maturity composition of the Fed's portfolio.

·         Participants at the meeting assessed it would take longer than previously anticipated to gain greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably to 2%.

·         Various participants mentioned willingness to tighten policy further should risks to outlook materialize and make such action appropriate.

·         Many participants commented on their uncertainty about the degree of policy restrictiveness.

·         Participants remarked that the future policy path would depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.

·         Fed staff's economic projection was similar to march outlook, but noted that deteriorating household financial positions, especially for lower-income households, might prove to be bigger drag on activity than anticipated.

·         US short-term interest-rate futures are down after the FOMC minutes. Traders still betting on a September start to Fed rate cuts.

Realistically nothing much has changed since last meeting… I think the only thing that might have been a slight shock to the market is that the discussion on potential future rate hikes or policy tightening was more relevant than JPOW lead on. However, realistically until next FOMC meeting and we get the Dot Plot which will solidify the feds 2024 path and early 2025 path there is nothing to be concerned about here… I don’t see this as a sustained bearish catalyst.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/xoqqmr3cc12d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c872bc843fd19c042ef66ee8b66808d8d228498a

We did finally get a new supply on SPY today at 531.39. Today also brought a weakening of sellers along with a backtest of the daily 8ema support. With bulls officially testing and bouncing off the EMA support here I do continue to expect upside. For the last 6 trading days we have held a range of 528.78-531.39.

Bulls need to break 531.39 to then target 535-540. Bears need to break 528.78 to then target a 523.45.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.45 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 528.78

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Very similarly here on ES we say daily buyers take a decent drop in support today. This of course brought a new supply at 5344 which gives us a 6 day long range of 5318-5344.

Bulls will look to bounce here off this daily 8ema support retest to then target a closure over 5344 and target 5400.

Bears look to close under 5318 and see 5266.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5318

**QQQ DAILY**

QQQ also saw a drop in daily buying support today. This drop brought a new supply at 455.86 which confirms our 6 day long range to be 451.67-455.86. Since bulls were able to bounce and hold range support (just short of it) we will look for a push higher over 455.86.

Bulls will target 460. Bears want to close under 451.67 to then target a drop to 445.36-446.44.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 445.36 -> 446.44 -> 455.86  
Demand- 442 -> 451.67

NQ also saw a drop in daily buying support today, however, it is the only one that did NOT get a new supply… We do have a pretty well established range of 18804 to 18631 though which we appear to have broken out of to the upside.

Bulls remain in extreme bull momentum here on the daily (es, spy, and qqq do too). This should provide a bounce here off range support to then target a breakout over 18804 to then target the bigger EOW push to 19000.

Bears need to close under 18631 to then target 18489.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18489 -> 18804  
Demand- 18234 -> 18631

**VIX DAILY**

Today as officially the lowest level the VIX has seen since January 17^(th) 2020 when the VIX touched a low of 11.75.

The VIX actually put in a new 52 week low demand/ support today at 11.85. Despite the near 8% pop on the VIX during FOMC Minutes release we ended up selling off and finding resistance once again at the daily 8ema.

Upside VIX target for bears is 13.73. The bulls will be content with the VIX remaining inside the 11.78 to 13 range.

Going into today I wanted to take a little mental break and just focus on trying to read price action better and getting back into a good groove. I ended up having a good long this morning on NQ and then I was in an ES long that got caught by one of the few massive random/ rogue drops we had.

Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c, ZUUZF for US investors) is drawing attention as it progresses with its Cuddy Mountain copper-silver project in Idaho, which is in the early stages of exploration.

https://preview.redd.it/qc6gdgaga22d1.png?width=2430&format=png&auto=webp&s=420e3bf4772053ae7c5c9b5674338e59a259f24d

Cuddy Mountain is located next to Hercules Silver’s Leviathan Zone, a copper-porphyry discovery that attracted a C$23 million investment from Barrick Gold Corp., positioning it to potentially become part of a new copper-porphyry district in Idaho.

The Zeus team plans to start a phase-one exploration program at Cuddy Mountain in the coming weeks, which will include rock and soil sampling and 3DIP surveying. This program aims to uncover more details about the site's potential in a state known for being mining-friendly.

Apart from Cuddy Mountain, Zeus's portfolio includes other early-stage exploration properties such as the Selway gold-silver property and the Great Western silver-copper property. In 2021, rock grab samples from Selway showed 1.37 g/t gold and 7.25 g/t silver, while Great Western samples returned copper grades between 0.61% and 4.25%, and silver up to 7,300 g/t.

Zeus also holds the Chlore copper-molybdenum property near Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada. Following a high-resolution magnetic survey in 2021, the company is planning a phase-one exploration program that includes geological mapping and rock grab sampling.

With a varied portfolio and favorable market conditions for copper, gold, and silver, Zeus North America Mining Corp. is strategically positioned for growth.

Mike Fagan, Editor of Resource Stock Digest, offers a comprehensive overview of Zeus’s strategic initiatives and exploration plans, emphasizing the company's potential to seize emerging opportunities in the mining sector.

1713,TLRY - a ticking meme timebomb.,"With elections coming up, there is growing anticipation that the federal ban on cannabis in the United States will be lifted within the next 12 months, especially with the prospect of such reforms becoming politically advantageous in upcoming elections. This favorable regulatory shift could serve as a major catalyst for Tilray Inc. (TLRY), a leading player in the cannabis industry, to double in value over the next year. When this federal ban is lifted, it will likely trigger a massive meme-stock event, which should yielding a 500-1000% return. Investors are advised to get in now before TLRY inevitably surges to $8-12 when this groundbreaking event occurs.

We have seen that in the past, even rumors of this news sends the stock from \~$2 to >$3. I am loading up at these prices for the inevitable meme event in the coming months.

1716,CDZI’s Bullish Momentum and Key Shareholder Insights,"**Good morning everyone.** Our recent top pick, CDZI, has been absolutely killing it! The stock surged to $3.30 per share, up about 7.5% yesterday. I checked out a recent article on Yahoo Finance about CDZI’s ownership structure and thought I’d share some of my findings. Communicated disclaimer, nfa…. I’m even more bullish now!

**Quick note:** We've blown past any price targets I initially set, but my bullish sentiment is growing stronger.

**New Targets:** $3.50, $3.65, $3.89, and $4.00+

**Key Insights:**

* **Private Company Influence:** Private companies hold 35% of Cadiz Inc.'s shares, giving them substantial influence over the company's decisions and future direction.
* **Top Five Shareholders:** The top five shareholders collectively own 52% of Cadiz, which underscores their significant sway in corporate governance.
* **Insider Activity:** Recent insider buying indicates confidence in the company’s prospects from those closest to its operations.

**Institutional Ownership and Its Impact:**  
Institutional investors hold 31% of Cadiz's shares, providing credibility and stability. These institutions typically invest in companies with strong growth potential and are often measured against benchmarks. However, reliance on institutional validation can be risky if multiple large investors decide to divest simultaneously (rare but possible).

**Hedge Fund Interests:**  
Hedge funds own about 5.8% of Cadiz shares. Known for their active investment strategies, hedge funds focus on medium-term catalysts that can drive up share prices. Their involvement is a sign of potential strategic maneuvers to enhance shareholder value.

**Major Shareholders:**

* Heerema International Group Services SA holds the largest stake with 35%.
* The second and third largest shareholders hold 5.8% and 3.9%, respectively.
* This concentration of ownership among the top five shareholders indicates significant control over the company's decisions and policies.

**Insider Ownership:**  
Insiders collectively own $3.2 million worth of shares in Cadiz. This alignment of interests between management and shareholders can be beneficial, ensuring that the company’s leadership is motivated to enhance shareholder value. However, it also necessitates transparency to prevent conflicts of interest.

**General Public and Private Companies:**  
The general public owns 27% of Cadiz, providing a broad base of individual investors who can influence company policies through their collective voice. Private companies, holding 35%, are crucial players whose strategic interests align closely with Cadiz’s long-term objectives.

**In conclusion,** I am thrilled with this info. I was already vaguely familiar, but now that I have the exact percentages, I am very happy with what I have learned.

Share your thoughts below about some of this info!

1719,Crypto Staking - EASY $7000 per month,"Hello, I want to share a method that has already earned me several thousand dollars.

Initially, I didn’t want to share it with anyone, not even with friends, but then I thought, why not. If I help someone today, they might help me tomorrow.

I learned about this method by chance from a crypto community that seeks out similar methods and maximizes their potential.

I got this method virtually for free and made a profit of **$100** on the first day, which is quite good. But I didn’t stop there. After a week, I already had **$500**, and by the time I'm writing this post, I have around **±$4000** in pure profit.

I won’t go into all the details. I'll just briefly explain how this method works, and if anyone wants to know more in detail, message me PM. I'll send you the original manual and video so as not to waste my time or yours!

The method is quite simple and suitable even for those who are only somewhat familiar with cryptocurrency.

# Step by step:

1. Buy a EOS coin
2. Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased EOS
3. Select Deposit and copy MEMO (Digits)
4. Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: EOS
* Address: **testnet**
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

1. Choose a small amount of coins for the test
2. And after **±10** minutes we get the amount sent, but only **+0.5% (in coins)**

As a result, we earn compound percent from transactions on the EOS network.

1724,Producer & Explorer LUCA.v Identifies New Wide High-Grade Gold Zones at Tahuehueto Mine,"Earlier this week, LUCA Mining Corp. (traded as LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors), which is expected to produce 60,000-70,000 oz of Gold Eq in 2024 between its two mines, announced a crucial development at its Tahuehueto Gold Mine, confirming new high-grade gold mineralization over extensive widths.   


https://preview.redd.it/glitnbb9h92d1.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6584d622ee128565ac5e3b7f87ddf4cf3de6137

This discovery involves shoots branching off the main Creston vein at Underground Level 23, one of the primary structures currently being mined.  
  
The Tahuehueto mine is situated within the Sierra Madre Mineral Belt, an area rich in active and historic mines. Although still under development, the Tahuehueto mine is expected to start generating positive cash flows this year, in line with LUCA's strategy to enhance shareholder returns.  
  
Detailed geological mapping and channel sampling at Level 23 have identified breccia ore shoots up to 20 meters wide. Some channel samples have revealed gold concentrations exceeding 20 grams per tonne (g/t Au).  
  
These high-grade zones, previously identified in earlier drilling, are integral to LUCA's plan to increase production to 1,000 tonnes per day (tpd), a target anticipated to be reached in the coming months.   
  
Since early 2022, underground development at Tahuehueto has advanced, focusing on access, dewatering, and initial mining at Level 23.  
  
The pre-feasibility study for Tahuehueto highlighted maximum vein widths of 8.4 meters in the hanging wall and 6.5 meters in the footwall vein splays at Level 23.  
  
Current measurements show comparable widths, with 4.9 meters in the footwall and 9.5 meters in the hanging wall, though vein geometries vary.  
  
The footwall splay, extending along a 160-meter strike, demonstrates excellent continuity. Channel sampling of the southwestern extent of the vein-breccia zone—approximately half of the fully exposed footwall splay—indicates a lateral extension of 200 meters by 230 vertical meters based on diamond drilling.   
  
This area remains open at depth and to the northeast and southwest, with these targets included in ongoing exploration.

In a very interesting turn of events FOMC itself was not the bearish catalyst but rather fomc minutes. Even a strong performance from NVDA today couldn’t hold this market higher.

Today honestly reminds me A LOT of 4/4/24. You can see just how similar these massive bearish engulfing candles.

As you can imagine we do not have stronger buyers once again today. After one day of stronger buyers in the last 6 trading days momentum was finally not enough and the flood gates opened.

Impressively we broke through not only 528.78 demand but also through the daily 8ema support. This now opens up an opportunity to retest 520.82 demand near the daily 20ema support.

As long as that daily 20ema support/ demand area holds I like this for a quick pullback before heading higher.

Bulls target is a closure back over 526.85 minimally.

Bears target is a closure minimally under 520.82.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 518.01 -> 523.45 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 528.78

After putting our new supply in at 5344 despite a major breakout to a new ATHS at 5368.25 this level once again has held as a major resistance area.

With a closure both under daily 8ema support and previous demand of 5318 we start to target the daily 20ema support and demand near 5239.

If bears close under 5239 we target 5188. If bulls bounce here we target a move back over 5301.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5318

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/v272mnfm1d2d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8766baf0e4946c5c96d86ccaf2a00ccde084723

Very similar major rejection off new ATHs and a bearish engulfing candle on QQQ here. Despite a major gap up over previous supply we completely gap filled and then some. This was an impressive move and rejection here… however unlike on ES/ SPY we actually did hold the daily 8ema support and previous demand. Tech continues to be much stronger than ES does. I do wonder if NVDA wasn’t up 11% at one point what the market would have looked like today.

Bears need to break 451.67 to then target 445.36. Bulls will look to move back over 455.86.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 445.36 -> 446.44 -> 455.86  
Demand- 442 -> 451.67

If you remember NQ was the only one that did not get a new supply yesterday. However, today it does get a new supply at 18814. With this new supply and rejection off a new ATH we have come back down to daily 8ema support and 18631 demand support.

From here bulls need to hold and close back over 18814. Bears will look to visit the daily 20ema support near 18382.

I wanted to play conservatively again today so I stuck with MNQ today. I am glad I did as the added range/ volatility meant that I got stopped out twice right before the big move happened.

1728,$SUUN Fakeout - The trend is your friend unless proven otherwise,"Unfortunately it is looking like the restest and bounce is not going to happen. The volume is declining and it has slightly broken the trendline. This morning is going to be key for $SUUN to continue its bullish momentum through the end of May. VOLUME IS KEY.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Trendline Break:**
   * The stock has slightly broken the ascending trendline, which is a bearish signal. Typically, a break below the trendline indicates a potential shift in momentum from bullish to bearish.
2. **Volume Decline:**
   * The declining volume is concerning as it suggests that the buying interest is waning. A healthy uptrend usually requires increasing volume to sustain the momentum.
3. **MACD Indicator:**
   * The MACD histogram is showing decreasing bars, which often signals weakening momentum. The MACD line crossing below the signal line can further confirm the bearish shift.
4. **Support and Resistance Levels:**
   * **Support:** The next key support level to watch is around $5.90. If this level holds, there might be a chance for a recovery. However, if it fails, the stock could see further downside.
   * **Resistance:** Immediate resistance is around $6.50. The stock needs to break above this level with strong volume to regain bullish momentum.
5. **Key Morning Session:**
   * The upcoming morning session is critical. Watch for any signs of a bounce back above the trendline with increased volume. If this occurs, it could negate the bearish signals and resume the bullish trend.

https://preview.redd.it/a5s4ci74lf2d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3414729a5e777c9547ceac385766de4e6627643c

Remember that markets will be CLOSED on Monday for memorial day weekend. We will pick up a 4 day trading week starting on Tuesday. Overall not too much data to worry about next week either. GDP is really the only thing I will keep an eye on.

**SPY WEEKLY**

From a weekly perspective besides the red weekly close here we honestly look very bullish still. Last week I mentioned that we would likely see a backtest of 523.21 supply before pushing higher, we came close hitting a low of 524.72. Going into next week we have stronger weekly buyers right now so I do expect being that we did not lose previous supply to see continuation higher.

Bulls are going to look for a move to 540 next week.

Bears will need to CLOSE under 523.21 supply to have control at the end of next week.

Supply- 523.21

Very similarly here on ES we still have stronger weekly buyers despite the pullback we had. We also bounced off and are going to defend 5307 supply which I mentioned last week was critical for bulls.

Being that we held this and held weekly 8ema support we should until that breaks expect further upside.

Bulls still have a target of 5400 to hit.

Bears will look to breakdown and under 5225 (weekly 8ema).

QQQ as to be expected weekly timeframe looks far more bullish than SPY does. On QQQ we continue to see stronger weekly buyers, extremely low volatility and we see a breakout without even backtesting the previous weekly supply at 446.38.

Bulls did finally hit my target of 460 and now we will look for 470.

Bears will look to backtest support at 446.38 supply.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 446.38

On NQ we also have stronger weekly buyers here to support further upside. With volatility being low and a failure for bears to break down under 18569 supply I am going to continue to look for upside. This weeks macro target was to finally break 19000 and we finally did hit it.

Bulls will continue to look to break back into the 19000 area now targeting 19200-19300.

Bears still need to breakdown and CLOSE under 18569.

Supply- 18569

This week was a weebit rough on me  Monday and Tuesday taking some pretty big Ls. I was expecting the lack of proper daily support to breakdown markets which finally yesterday did happen. However, I was far too early and it certainly cost me.

I finished the week out trading MES and MNQ and enjoyed that to get some confidence back and get back in a good zone.

1736,"Zeus North America Mining Corp. Announces 2024 Exploration Plans for Cuddy Mountain Property Near Rio Tinto, Barrick Gold and a Major Copper, Molybdenum, and Silver Find","Yesterday, Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for US investors) announced its exploration plans for 2024, focusing on its flagship Cuddy Mountain Property. This property is strategically located adjacent to Hercules Silver Corp.’s Hercules Project, which has recently reported a significant copper porphyry discovery. 

Hercules' discovery at the Leviathan Porphyry Copper site includes an impressive intersection of 185 meters of 0.84% Copper, 111 ppm Molybdenum, and 2.6 g/t Silver, with a particularly rich segment of 45 meters at 1.95% Copper. This discovery underscores the potential of the surrounding region, including Zeus’ Cuddy Mountain Property.

**Exploration Program Highlights**

ZEUS is set to commence an extensive exploration program at Cuddy Mountain. ZEUS has contracted Dias Geophysical Ltd. to conduct a comprehensive 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization (IP) and Resistivity Survey across the property. This survey is scheduled for spring and summer 2024 and aims to identify promising mineralization zones.

The exploration program will also involve detailed soil sampling, mapping, and prospecting, along with rock grab sampling and high-resolution ground magnetics. These activities are designed to generate an integrated data set to pinpoint high-priority drill targets.

ZEUS is also planning initial reconnaissance prospecting and rock grab sampling at its Selway and Great Western properties which are also in Idaho. These efforts aim to evaluate potential mineralization for silver, copper, gold, lead, and zinc. Subsequent field programs will be designed based on the results.

**Strategic Advantages**

The Cuddy Mountain Property shares several geological similarities with the adjacent Hercules Property:

* Both properties feature Olds Ferry terrane rocks, including the Hercules Rhyolite and Seven Devils Volcanics.
* Historical silver occurrences and small-scale mines hosted in rhyolite are present on both properties.
* Both properties lie along the Bayhorse Thrust Fault, a major structural corridor associated with significant mineralization.
* An erosional window through the younger Columbia River basalts provides access to the underlying mineral-rich formations.

**Area Wide Staking Rush**

The recent staking rush in the area, which has seen major players like Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto stake numerous mining claims, further validates the potential of Zeus' Cuddy Mountain Property. Notably, Hercules Silver Corp. ring-staked the Zeus property prior to their discovery announcement, highlighting its strategic importance.

Dean Besserer, President and CEO of ZEUS highlighted this, stating, ""This is one of the largest staking rushes I’ve seen in my career. Many still don’t recognize the magnitude of this discovery as it has unveiled a new and previously unknown Porphyry Copper belt. The fact that we have the property directly adjacent to such a great discovery and along the same major structure is exciting"".

1753,RUA GOLD Commences Exploration Program at Glamorgan Project in NZ's Hauraki Goldfields,"Last week, RUA GOLD (Ticker: RUA.c or NZAUF for US investors) initiated exploration activities at its 4,600-hectare Glamorgan Project in the Hauraki Goldfields on New Zealand's North Island. The company secured a drone concession from the Department of Conservation, enabling it to conduct magnetic geophysical surveys at the site.

With this, the company's exploration team, consisting of highly skilled professionals with extensive experience in geology, geochemistry, and geophysical exploration technology, has mobilized to Glamorgan.

The team is excited as previous exploration within the permit identified silicification, veining, and alteration with gold concentrations greater than 50 ppb in soils over 3.8km. Additionally, rock samples returned up to 95 g/t gold. 

Historically, the Hauraki region has produced over 15M ounces of gold and 60M ounces of silver. The Glamorgan Project is especially well-located within the region, only 2.8km from OceanaGold’s Wharekirauponga Project (WKP) which has an indicated resource of 1.01 Moz at 15.9 g/t. 

The WKP was recently included in New Zealand’s Fast Track Approvals Bill, providing a clear pathway for accelerated project development for RUA.

RUA is currently applying for minimum impact access from the Department of Conservation to conduct soil sampling, resistivity geophysical surveys, and geological mapping. These activities are expected to begin before July, setting the stage for designing a drilling program and applying for full access to start drilling before 2025.

1756,$RILY-have shorts shifted to naked shorting? Or Are they exiting?,"$RILY on a daily basis for this past month always seems like it has more sellers then buyer and watching the daily data , you can see all the available shares for short are being borrowed daily. It’s been millions of shares this past month , doesn’t mean they are not being covered on up days. Judging from what I have seen as far as shorting activity, it has been consistent and strategic. All that being said based on Fintel data, short interest (not naked shorts ) has decreased. How’s that possible you ask? The only two answers come to mind is 1. Naked shorts 2. Strategic sell offs on low volume days , as an example stock trades at $35 and there’s low volume, let’s say total volume of 400k daily volume vs 1.2 million. Shorts will short 250-300K shares and drive share price   Down to 29-30. These are the games the shorts have been playing , whether pure naked shorting with millions of shares or strategic attacks on lower volume days and try to maintain the sell offs ( stock manipulation). Sadly for the shorts buyers keep coming in and there more catalysts to come. Whether we have a squeeze or a steady March up to $55-60. $RILY is going higher.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1768,DKNG - Great entry on a market leader on tax news,"The state of Illinois has issued a tax hike on gambling profits - DKNG down 12% on the news, Flutter 7%.  

Before efforts to mitigate the tax hike, Citi analysts said it could cost Flutter $94 million if in place over a full year. Mitigation may come from lower promotional spending, the firm said.

BTIG analysts said they don't see momentum for similar tax hikes in other states. Last week, the Massachusetts State Senate defeated an amendment that would have hiked the state's sports betting tax from 20% to 51%, which would have matched New York's for the highest in the nation.

This news should blow over quickly and currently presents a great opportunity to buy a market leader at a good discount. 

I expect shares to climb back to the $42-$47 range over the next 4-8 weeks, an increase of roughly 18-32%.

1770,"Four Day Trading Weeks… 5-28-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Generally speaking any time we have a four day trading week it usually is very low volume. I still believe we are headed into a minimum a consolidation period  on the daily. Until FOMC and Cpi which come on the same day in about two weeks I don’t really see anything to sell us off.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/ueps6687683d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c564774dd010a52b18e03b2ae3d82e19bffac761

On the daily timeframe here for SPY we have realistically been trading in a range of 526-533 for the last 9 trading days right now. However, supply and demand wise our range actually is 527.76-531.39. We have a pretty nice line in the sand resistance area here of 531.39 that I imagine if we don’t close over that then we will not be seeing much upside. I also see the daily 8ema as a definitive support before we go lower.

There really in my opinion is not a good direction one could chose here… natural movement says we go higher but we do not have stronger daily buyers for the 4^(th) day in a row now (actually are nearing sellers again) and we have once again lost extreme bull momentum. I would comfortably say that bulls and bears have an equal shot with the correct volume (which is key).

Bulls need to break out over 533 and bears need to breakdown under 526.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.45 -> 527.76  
Demand- 520.82 -> 528.78

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Very similar on ES we have a range of 5285 to 5344. Now on ES I would say that the supply/ resistance of the range at 5344 is far more established and important than the 531.39-533 on Spy. We have had 6 rejections off this 5344 area over the last 9 trading days. Until bulls close over this level we are likely not heading much higher.

Interestingly enough here of the last 8 trading days we have only had stronger daily buyers 3 of those days. That shows that we are losing steam and losing support (along with the loss of extreme bull momentum). I again think that volume is what is going to push this one way or another once it comes in whether that be sellers like Thursday or buyers like Friday last week.

Bulls need to close over 5344 and bears need to close under 5285 which is demand.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5285

**QQQ DAILY**

SPY and QQQ have a very interesting structure here in my opinion as that Thursday massive bear candle just kind of throws everything into a weird spot from a technical stand point. Much like SPY we have a range of 451.67 to 460.58. Now on QQQ unlike SPY our range support is actually confirmed with a demand at 451.67. However, our range resistance is actually much lower at 455.86. There is also an interesting supply/ demand magnet at this 455.26-455.86 area.

Much like SPY on QQQ we have not had stronger daily buyers for 4 days straight now, however, we actually remain in extreme daily bull momentum which is likely why we continue to see TECH outweigh the strength of the broader market.

Bulls need to retake 460.58 and bears need to close under 451.67.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 446.44 -> 455.86  
Demand- 442 -> 451.67 -> 455.26

Of the last 8 trading days on NQ we have only seen stronger daily buyers 4 times, however, unlike ES we are still in extreme daily bull momentum here on NQ. Bulls did put in another new demand here on nq at 18679.

Our established supply and demand range here on NQ is 18631 to 18814. Nq has constantly been trying to break out but appears to be held back by the broader market. With a breakout and bounce off 18814 I am curious to see if bulls can continue to break higher tomorrow.

Bulls need to cleanly break and close over 19000 and bears need to close under 18631.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18489 -> 18814  
Demand- 18234 -> 18631-> 18679

I won’t go into all the details. I'll just briefly explain how this method works, and if anyone wants to know more in detail, message me PM. I'll send you the original manual and video so as not to waste my time or yours!

The method is quite simple and suitable even for those who are only somewhat familiar with cryptocurrency.

Impressively the bears completely took over last night during the after hours session. However, once again once markets open it was all bulls. Now granted we were more range based trading with almost the whole day on ES spent in a 10 pt range and NQ spent in a 50 pt range.

https://preview.redd.it/czlwdtcusf3d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1060b5b45904f58953e0c0e1ce0a60479be84a4a

There is certainly some anticipation for GDP and Jobless claims tomorrow. With the bulls showing a little weakness here we could see a negative market reaction tomorrow… however, our range is likely to hold regardless of this data.

**SPY DAILY**

The bulls had put in a new demand yesterday at 527.76 but as I had said we had been holding a more macro range of 526-533. Today we put in another supply at 530.36 which now makes a really nice double supply resistance for our range here. Not only that but we closed under the daily 8ema support here and have a full candle below it now.

Bulls need to recover over the daily 8ema resistance of 527.7 tomorrow.

Bears are going to look to come back down to 523.45 double confirmed supply and test the daily 20ema support.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.45 -> 530.36 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 527.76

ES Futures look very similar here after its new demand at 5285 we are now seeing a new resistance/ supply at 5325. This double supply/ resistance of our range at 5325-5344 is now critical for bulls to break through. We also watch the daily 8ema support today but continue to hold the daily 20ema support. I mentioned yesterday on ES our daily range was more obvious being 5285-5344. Today the bulls did a great job of defending that support which honestly opens us up for a strong daily bounce tomorrow.

Bulls need to retake 5306 daily 8ema resistance.

Bears need to break through 5266 supply and close under 20ema support.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5266 -> 5325 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5285

Yesterday on QQQ we put in a new demand at 455.26 which gave us a nice double demand/ support area of 451.67-455.26. Today the bears were able to put in a new higher supply at 459.82.

The bulls actually did a really great job of bouncing off the daily 8ema support and previous demand at 455.26. As I have mentioned we continue to realistically be range based here. Bulls cant continue to breakout without a major rejection like today and Thursday. But bears also cant seem to follow through lower.

Bulls need to close over 459.82.

Bears need to minimally break through 455.26 but ideally 451.67 demand/ range support.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 446.44 -> 459.82  
Demand- 451.67 -> 455.26

Similar here on NQ we have our macro range of 18631 to 18953. NQ much like ES has a perfect range set up that is also confirmed by our supply and demand levels here.

Much like I have been saying bears cant quite seem to break through that 18631-18679 support. However, bulls cant quite seem to break through and hold over 18953. The bulls also directly bounced off daily 8ema support which with daily bull momentum continuing to hold here we have to favor that upside. As I mentioned above I would not be surprised to see the algos use this to push us higher.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18489 -> 18953  
Demand- 18631 -> 18679

Today was not a great day but not a bad day either. I was only able to hit green in 1 of my three accounts today. I made a mistake this morning in my APEX account as I thought I had my template set to MES for APEX but apparently it was set up for ES. I didn’t get filled initially on my linked long so I manually entered and then it filled me anyways late. Well then I realized too later I was in two ES not two MES. I am having some issues with my APEX payouts here so I am basically just treading water with MES/ MNQ until things get figured out (aka they pay me actually).

* TP 2 - 1.10 (22%)

**Straight Forward DD**

GoldMining Inc. (TSX: GOLD; NYSE-A: GLDG) had their IPO in 2011, and emerging from the chaos that was the Great Recession, GLDG has been silently dipping their hands into a variety of gold and copper mining projects in both North and South America. The company has strategically positioned itself to take advantage of the lucrative opportunities within the mining sector, focusing on regions with rich mineral resources and stable political environments. Over the years, GLDG has developed a diverse portfolio of mining assets, including exploration and development projects in Canada, the United States, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.

It’s clear CEO Alastair Still is watching the MAJOR shift happening in the commodity market with his recent investments, as gold prices have seen record highs in 2024, with copper in the same vicinity. Alastair Still, who brings a wealth of experience from his previous roles at Goldcorp and Newmont, has been steering the company towards projects that not only promise high returns but also ensure sustainable and responsible mining practices. His vision for GLDG includes leveraging advanced mining technologies and practices to maximize output while minimizing environmental impact.

The company also JUST announced that they’ve started a HUGE drilling project within the Tapajos Gold District in Brazil. This region is known for its rich gold deposits and has been a hotspot for mining activities for decades. The new drilling project aims to explore untapped reserves and expand the company’s resource base significantly. This could be massive news for their ticker as $GLDG is trading just around $0.90. Investors are eagerly watching this development, as a successful drilling project in Tapajos could lead to a substantial increase in the company’s valuation and stock price.

I’ll do a deeper dive into their charts and fundamentals soon. Analyzing GLDG’s financial statements and recent performance metrics will provide a clearer picture of the company’s health and growth potential. Key indicators to watch will include their revenue growth, profit margins, cash flow, and debt levels. Additionally, understanding the geological data and potential yield from their new drilling projects will be crucial in assessing their future prospects. Overall I recommend you check them out and dive deeper if you can! Communicated Disclaimer: this is nfa, but just the tip of the iceberg of DD.

1802,"I don't want to be Regarded anymore, I think I might have ""Clowns"" Syndrome","For some reason, I always buy the top and sell the bottom. I went all in on AMC the Friday before the APE conversion was approved. I am unemployed, I quit my government job because I thought I could become a full-time day trader. I schooled myself for months watching YouTube videos thinking this was the way to financial freedom. Somehow, I got addicted to Bear porn, and spent hours watching Adam Taggart videos, and Reventure Consulting shorts. I can't stop reading  or . I'm a member of  and I don't even have it.

The worst part is, I thought RE was going to crash, so I sold my house for 300k in 2020, and used the cash for buying risky call options. Now the Zestimate on my old place is 600k

What's wrong with me? There has always been something wrong with me. I've had friends tell me in confidence they can see it in my eyes, every so slightly crossed like I have a touch of ""clowns."" I guess I am what you would call Neurodivergent or something. Only slightly regarded, not full on, IDK. It's not fun making such bad choices all the time though.

I started taking a regard-b-gone, and for once, I had a good trade! (AST). I can feel it all turning around for me, and it can work for you too. It worked for my wife's boyfriend too.

TLDR: I made bad choices in life, such as buying AMC before the APE conversion, and selling my house in 2020 because I thought RE was going to crash. I took a regard-b-gone and I think it worked since I made money on an AST trade.

Their next omnibus court hearing is set for Monday, June 1st. 
    

Over the past 6 months and from respective low points throughout the preceding year, YELLQ has (in many cases far) surpassed the stock gains of Meta/CleanSpark/Nvidia/Carvana/DellTechnologies/CelesticaInc/VistraCorp/VertivHoldings/GigaCloudTechnology/SuperMicro/VikingThera/Coinbase/MicroStrategy/VeraThera/Abercrombie&Fitch/FusionPharma and ApplovinCorp.  What a story! 🔥 3+ hedge funds and the U.S. Government all remain major (common stock) shareholders in Yellow Corporation.  By the time their bankruptcy proceedings wrap up next year and the final numbers shake out, some believe the company's stock will clear $15-20 per share.

1815,"5-31-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","Despite a PCE reading that showed that CPI likely will come in line next month. The bears impressively put in a solid week and prevented the bulls from much of a breakout.

https://preview.redd.it/47fl3bgsjt3d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=72ce13005ee056e73c69df222080506b3c45f814

Next week the market will get to digest a ton more economic data as we head into CPI and FOMC the week after that. The next two weeks are going to be jam packed full of data and information for the markets to digest.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/odyh7atsjt3d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=132e2b81dcbcbed7237d07025d52523c1c54f3b8

Going into this week we had the double top doji set up for a potential weekly rejection, however I was looking more towards a breakout due to daily extreme bull momentum and weekly stronger buyers.

Despite that setup the bears actually held the double top and took us right back down to weekly 8ema support near 520. We also saw weekly buyers weaken again here (which also pairs with daily sellers now). Thanks to the incredible EOD power hour rally today though we are not seeing a new weekly supply though.

Bulls next week will look to double bottom bounce off daily 8ema support and ideally close over the 530 triple top.  

Bears need to close the weekly under 8ema support to then target a bigger sell off down to 20ema support near 506.5.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.21  
Demand- 494.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

On ES we also had the doji candle setup for an indecision here. The bulls ended up failing to breakout which led to a drop back to weekly 8ema support. Despite breaking through that support for a while today the bulls were able to regain that support thanks to the massive EOD rally.

Bulls need to double bottom bounce off 8ema support and close ideally over 5330 double top resistance.

Bears will look to break down through 8ema support and target the 20ema support near 5106.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307  
Demand- 5000

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/zujzjfltjt3d1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f19dbab749184de3e8d16d677548cc0c363d710

On QQQ weekly here we had a much stronger breakout potential on this weekly candle setup than we did on SPY. I am actually a little surprised that tech broke down as much as it did this week.

With a new weekly supply at 458.11 and a weekly buyers weaking there is an opportunity for the bears next week.

Bears need to close under weekly 8ema support and target a bigger drop down to 432.74.

Bulls need to double bottom bounce off weekly 8ema support and ideally close over 458.11.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 408.58 -> 458.11  
Demand- 414.4

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

As you can imagine very similar move here on NQ. A massive weekly double top here on NQ with a new supply at 18881 and a bearish engulfing weekly candle.

This will be a major decision for the next 2-3 weeks in my opinion. IF the bulls lose the weekly 8ema support we could see a sizeable drop back into the 17500 range. However, if they can hold support likely we will be headed higher.

Bulls need to close over 18881 ideally and bears need to close under weekly 8ema support ideally.

NQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 16957 -> 18881  
Demand- 17176

I had some good trades today I unfortunately missed the first short this morning I wanted. I was looking for a bounce just a little after opening hour that didn’t come to much later unfortunately.

1840,CISS sea ​​freight,"$CISS The Shanghai Container Freight Index (SCFI), which indicates the level of freight rates on maritime transportation routes, recorded 3,044.77 as of the 31st of last month, up 341.34 points compared to the previous week. It has been 1 year and 9 months since August 2022 that SCFI exceeded the 3,000 mark.

This is believed to be due to the fact that ships heading to Europe and the Americas have bypassed the Cape of Good Hope in Africa amid the ongoing Red Sea crisis caused by attacks on ships by Houthi rebels in Yemen, resulting in a significant increase in sea freight rates on that route.

Now there was some interesting issues today if you missed them.

https://preview.redd.it/fspw2a81ze4d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29922ed9122357e283179073ae80cad2a179445b

I put a screenshot of the post from yahoo but there was apparently issues with a few tickers on the NYSE today which caused numerous halts and issues with the NYSE tape. The most notable was that at one point class A stocks for BERK was down 99.97% only to recover it and push 15% higher. The rumor is that some lucky person was able to buy $5k total worth of shares at the 99.97% dip… if that actually happened they turned 5k into about 17mil instantly…

Personally going into today I was expecting a push higher especially on ES due to its bullish technicals. However, at open NQ was severely lagging. These NYSE set up the perfect daily double top and failed recovery here on ES.

However, our ranges on ES and NQ continue to hold. There is not any solid long term direction here.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/htvnkbz1ze4d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=146db4bb04b16a780b3a599cf1d447b66fcc4d63

We are forming a potential downward trend here on the markets but we realistically since early May continue to be in a range. Range support is 520.82-522.61 and range resistance is 530.36-531.39. Someone needs to make a move before we end up with a solid direction.

This bounce off of the demand almost to the penny is generally bullish and likely will lead to support holding here. Despite most of the day being spent red the buyer stepped in at EOD to actually put in a green day.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 518.01 -> 530.36 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 522.61

Very similar here on ES we had stronger daily sellers come in only to the final few minutes of the day weaken and push green. The daily 20ema support on backtest along with the double demand/ support area of our range from 5239-5251 held well today on the backtest.

Much like SPY our upside range resistance is 5325-5344 and support is 5239-5251 and someone is going to need to make a move before we are able to break this month long consolidation.

QQQ also remains in a range here with support being 450.65 and resistance being 459.82. Now QQQ was the only one last week that did not get a new demand, however, today it finally did get a new demand which confirms our range. Despite the green day on QQQ today we actually have stronger sellers though.

Bulls need to break through 455.26 and realistically 459.82 to break range and the bears need to close under daily 20ema support of 449.12 to see downside and a break of the range.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS

On Friday we got a new demand on NQ at 18594. For a little bit of today we were looking at turning this demand (Support) into a supply (Resistance). However, we ended up finding enough support EOD despite the stronger sellers to avoid that.

Our macro range here on NQ is 18594 to 18953 to break the month long consolidation. NQ remains sandwhiched with back to back dojis inside the daily 8 ema resistance and daily 20ema support.

I actually love being transparent with you guys because I think it makes it real for you and me...

I messed up this morning making a simple but stupid mental error and it just all went down hill from there. I had seen a great long opportunity and went to enter but some how ended up entering short instead (I just clicked the wrong button). I instantly was stopped out on NQ (meaning I would had instantly won) and then my ES I stopped out myself. I still saw long so I immediately went long and if of course instantly dropped on me. I lost two 50k accounts that were already down on their drawdown.

I was able to pass two more 50k expert accounts today on MFFU though to make up for the lost accounts and I already had one MFFU 50k account waiting for me as a backup. While it sucks and it was a complete mental error and just made a huge mistake that led to losing two of my accounts I was able to recover my lost accounts and I was able to be sizeably green in my other MFFU 50k and my APEX PA.

was able to pass two experts just now 50k... my dumbass though was $20 from passing but passed the other... i accidentally entered in the passed account instead of the one who needed $20... thankfully i just hit a new lod there and passed both.

1854,"Recent News Summary: Gold, Silver, Copper Producer LUCA.v Advances Production and Financial Strength"," Last week, Luca Mining Corp. (Ticker: LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors) shared that it has made significant strides with promising exploration results and robust financial performance. Operating two producing and 100%-owned mines in Mexico, the company's recent press releases highlight the discovery of new high-grade gold zones at the Tahuehueto Gold Mine and their positive financial results for Q1 2024.

**High-Grade Gold Zones at Tahuehueto Gold Mine**

Luca Mining has confirmed the presence of high-grade gold mineralization with substantial mining widths at the Tahuehueto Gold Mine in Durango, Mexico. The discovery is significant, as it reveals mineralized breccia ore shoots up to 20 meters wide at Underground Level 23, the lowest level in the mine. These findings are part of the company's ongoing geological mapping and channel sampling efforts.

https://preview.redd.it/oi14yxdewf4d1.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=680d97e1de0956da40cc32ee61b18cd0ba6a3fcb

**Geological Insights**

The underground mine development at Tahuehueto has been advancing since early 2022, focusing on accessing, dewatering, and mining Level 23. Two mineralized splays have been exposed on the hanging wall and footwall sides of the Creston fault, showcasing economic widths of up to 20 meters. The area hosts two types of mineralization: structurally controlled hydrothermal breccias with zinc and lead sulfides and high-grade gold and silver mineralization superimposed over base metal sulfides.

**Channel Sampling Results**

Channel sampling in the mineralized zones has provided promising results, with maximum assay values of 65.04 g/t gold, 267 g/t silver, 4.41% copper, 11.29% lead, and 14.19% zinc. The average assay values across 494 samples indicate substantial mineralization, affirming the potential for significant resource expansion in the upcoming exploration programs.

**Strong Financial Performance in Q1 2024**

Luca Mining's financial results for Q1 2024 showcase the company's operational and financial strength. The company reported a net income of C$7.3 million, driven by a 21% increase in total net revenue to C$22.04 million. This growth reflects the company's successful production and optimization efforts at its two mines.

**Production and Revenue Highlights**

\- Production of 14,148 troy ounces of gold equivalent, including 4,297 ounces of gold, 207,505 ounces of silver, 3,068 tonnes of zinc, 791 tonnes of copper, and 661 tonnes of lead.

\- Positive operating earnings with C$4.8 million in operating income and C$7.3 million in net income.

\- Positive operating cash flow of C$4.04 million before working capital changes.

**Cost Management and Future Outlook**

The all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per gold equivalent ounce produced were US$1,325 at Campo Morado and US$1,690 at Tahuehueto, with consolidated AISC of US$1,549. Luca Mining anticipates a decrease in AISC as production ramps up in the second half of 2024. The company is also nearing the completion of construction at Tahuehueto, with the last major component, a third filter press, being installed and expected to be operational in Q2 2024.

1873,"6-4-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I mentioned yesterday that today was very similar to 5/24 into 5/29 and for most of the overnight and morning the setup and rejection was there… however we have once again continued to find strength in the 2^(nd) half of the day. However, the bulls were not able to provide the same strength during power hour as the last two days.

https://preview.redd.it/mgqnmsib3m4d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e4a60a825f2aff4e829b4f164b26bf28ab09e0

We continue our data heavy week with non farm and PMI tomorrow.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/30ygd82c3m4d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=76da2a4414ae0c7aab721fa6bc4a35a5d2216a00

Our range that I mentioned of 520.82-531.39 continues to hold. The longer we hold inside this range the harder and harder intraday trading is going to be. The big issue now is that we are officially a week out from probably the biggest data day of 2024 so far next Wednesday when we get CPI at 830 AM and then the fed speaks at 230pm for FOMC. I would honestly not be surprised to see us hold this range until Wednesday.

Bulls need to CLOSE over 531.39 and bears need to CLOSE under 520.82 still.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 518.01 -> 530.36 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 522.61

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Very similar here on ES our range of 5239-5344 continues to hold and of course we continue to have no sense of direction here. I do find it interesting that we actually despite not getting a new supply today had stronger sellers. It is also notable that 5301 is a soft resistance to keep an eye on and that we once again held daily 20ema support.

Bulls need to close over 5344 and bears need to close under 5239 still.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5251

**QQQ DAILY**

On the Qs we also had stronger daily sellers today despite not putting in a new supply (resistance). The macro range here on QQQ of 450.65 to 459.82 continues to hold with the bulls bouncing us just shy today of that demand/ support area. 455 is the same soft resistance we much watch here on QQQ.

Bulls must close over 459.82 and bears must close under 450.65 but preferably 449.71 (daily 20ema).

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 446.44 -> 459.82  
Demand- 442 -> 450.65

We once again tested the daily 20ema support of 18545 and demand of 18594 but were not able to break through that area. NQ continues to find itself sandwiched between the daily 8ema resistance and daily 20ema support once again. We are actually borderline forming a short term bear flag here on the daily but also a much longer term (think weekly) bull flag still.

Bulls must retake 18953 and bears must break through 18594 but preferably 18545 (daily 20ema support at close.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18953  
Demand- 18234 -> 18594

1876,West Red Lake Gold Mines' (WRLG.v) Significant Developments: High-Grade Gold Drill Results & New Appointment,"**High-Grade Drill Results from North Austin Zone**

West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) recently released detailed drill results from its Madsen Mine, located in the Red Lake Gold District of Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The drill program, conducted from underground on the North Austin Zone, aims to expand this high-grade mineralization area.

These results indicate significant high-grade gold mineralization: 

\- 2.79 m at 37.33 g/t Au, including 1.0 m at 88.06 g/t Au

\- 9.02 m at 5.26 g/t Au, including 0.88 m at 22.34 g/t Au

\- 1.57 m at 25.12 g/t Au, including 1.0 m at 31.47 g/t Au

\- and 2 m at 9.5 g/t Au, including 1.0 m at 17.94 g/t Au

The North Austin Zone remains open at depth and along strike, indicating potential for further resource expansion. The zone sits adjacent to existing underground development, marking it as a high-caliber, near-surface target for future mine restart and production.

West Red Lake Gold aims to enhance resource understanding and maximize value as they prepare for a planned mine restart by 2025.

Shane Williams, President and CEO, emphasized the potential of the North Austin Zone and outlined the company's strategy to de-risk the asset and capitalize on high-grade, near-mine growth opportunities.

**Appointment of Gwen Preston as VP of Investor Relations**

1877,Possible New Strategy to Make Millions and Keep Hedgies At Bay,"I think the problem with the current MEME plays is the Hedge Funds etc..  know how the game is being played.

  
An announcement is made on Reddit and the Apes buy as much as possible sometimes with huge resistance or without follow through from other supporters. 

The first time the Hedgies were Unprepared, now they have all the MEME stocks on watch, including Reddit. When it is announced they short the heck out of the stock not to mention they are watching key levels. Trying to make it impossible for the normal trader to make a profit. After all the deck is stacked against us. 

I propose instead of keeping the the same MEME stocks year after year it is rotated to new stocks. Then announcements are not made until everyone can get ready to pull the trigger, maybe even rotate the time frames. Morning, Noon, Before Close.

1879,"BCI technology develops rapidly, WiMi speeds up its innovation in AR application","In the contemporary world, tech companies must accelerate the development of large models, standards for generative AI, and completion of the standards for cloud computing. In the Metaverse era, the industry will more focus on the layout of the Quantum information standard study, the innovation of BCI standard study, building the next generation of the Internet, applications with Web 3.0, etc., which may enhance the integration of comprehensive application and Metaverse fundamental development.

 

 **Musk announced Neuralink is going to take a further study**

According to the social media reports on May 28^(th), in the market, Elon Musk participated in the establishment of the Brain-computer interface technology company- Neuralink, which planned to recruit 3 patients in the BCI experiment, and they will also estimate the devices. And this research and study may take years to get the final statistics.

According to reports, Neuralink establishes the connection and control channel between the human brain and external equipment by inserting electrodes, chips, and other devices into the human brain. These devices make it possible for people to directly control the external devices just resorting to bioelectial signals of the brain or some external stimuli that regulate cerebral activity.



In March, Musk said on a social media platform that the Blindsight implantation technology of Neyralink is already working in monkeys. By training monkeys, the researchers let a monkey stare at a point on the screen and measure the excitement in its brain, then they will build a one-by-one connection between the monkey and the device.

BCI can set up a direct information channel between the Brain and the computer so that we can monitor the brain states realizing the mind control. According to the distribution of its patent application in the long-term development and maturity of BCI technology, most companies prefer the technical theme of vision, digital devices, and signal processing, which covers material science and AI image processing, it also involves many high-tech innovation frontiers of electrical communication.

There is no doubt that BCI brings more possibilities to us. What’s more, immersive technology products for VR, AR, and MR are also the ideal devices for BCI connection. The graft of XR extended devices and non-invasive brain interface may become one of the significant scenes of BCI technology. BCI technology has the potential to help our society to realize those impossible wishes.

 

W**iMi joins the BCI technology field**

Emerging technologies and their applications have brought new development opportunities and challenges to technology. According to public information, the WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) team has carried out a series of efforts in recent years to promote the application of cutting-edge technologies such as expanded reality, artificial intelligence, digital twin, 5G, and light field vision. At the same time, based on the exploration and layout of cutting-edge technology innovation, WiMi relies on its superior resources and explores the in-depth research and development work in the field of “brain-computer interfaces”, promotes the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and provide important support for the large-scale application of brain-computer interfaces.



The cutting-edge technology of brain-computer interface has been more and more applied in the practical fields and attracted more and more attention. In this process, WiMi is trying to brave the waves, improve the quality, and enter the trillion-level blue ocean, so that the “future industry” and “real needs” are closely linked. It is reported that in terms of education, WiMi can better understand students’ learning needs and feedback, provide personalized education programs, and improve the learning effect and interest. Facing the future, WiMi will continue to make full efforts to build a brain-computer interface innovation and open ecological accumulation momentum.

 

C**onclusion**

BCI has strengthened the interdisciplinary integration, strengthened the connection between industry, university, and research, and formed a circular pattern of multi-directional investment of enterprises and society, which has made great progress for its academic research and industrialization development. From this point of view, the brain-computer interface from shallow to deep, looking forward to through the brain-computer interface, innovation results release and other fields, the future can be expected.",1717573890,827890,No_Truth_2706,t2_zs5zwl0yo,3c0d8bbf90616350ede8dce90eba0382ef314933d386d0955b3954e1e5971a4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1d8kdpk/bci_technology_develops_rapidly_wimi_speeds_up/

1881,BioTech Leading The Way,"I’ve had a sharp eye on this stock amid the market turbulence and I’m beginning to think now is the time to make a play on it.

**RenovoRx. Inc.** is a biopharmaceutical company that aims to develop innovative targeted combination therapies designed for difficult-to-treat tumors such as pancreatic cancer. One such development is the company’s staple technology, the Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP) platform. This advanced technology is designed to deliver high concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs directly to the tumor site while ultimately minimizing systemic exposure.

**$RNXT** is currently trading at $1.07 a share, but the overlapping industries give this stock unwavering potential.

Here’s 3 reasons why I’m confident as an investor:

1. **Lead Product Showcases Promising Growth**

**RenovoGem** is an oncology drug-device combination designed to deliver targeted chemotherapy, utilizing RenovoRx’s TAMP Technology, directly to tumor sites while still reducing side effects commonly associated with the treatment. The product is still in clinical trials, but has received FDA Orphan Drug Destination for *pancreatic* cancer, essentially providing years of market exclusivity and building a runway to be a barrier-breaking form of treatment in the field of oncology

1. **Wide Market Landscape**

RenovoRx’s TAMP Platform has potential beyond treating pancreatic cancer. The technology’s reduced systemic exposure while delivering direct chemotherapy at high concentrations can revolutionize treatment for a large scope of hard-to-treat cancers.

1. **Strategic and Experienced Leadership**

Prior to taking over as CEO of RenovoRx in June 2014, Shaun R. Bagai was the Global Market Development Leader at Heartflow, Inc., and has a proven track record for innovative technological launches for growth companies and large corporations alike. Additionally, the rest of the leadership team surrounding $RNXT has over 200 years of experience in drug development and commercialization with proven track records of blockbuster drug launches as well. 

RenovoRx is in position to deliver SIGNIFICANT ROI to investors given the ever-growing market sectors where $RNXT has started to blaze a trail; their current share price just currently comes at a discount.

Does anybody else have a position with a BioTech stock? I’ve had some time to do some thorough DD on this one - with the strong fundamentals, I expect to see a sizable gap in share price over both short and long term periods.

1894,"Bulls Squeeze into New ATHs… 6-5-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Our range that we have been trading in for just under a month now has officially been broken in one big swift move. With how much we fought at range support/ demand for almost 4 days I would have expected a much bigger fight here at supply/ resistance. However, the momentum and buying today was so extreme there was all gas and no brakes to a new ATH (technically ES hit a HOD that is exactly the previous ATH of 5368.25).

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/wqdwol8fit4d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2544e4d7882c84d0107a4a89848a2d46ed337b

We once again had buyers come in stronger today to defend the daily 8ema support. Not only did we get a very hard bounce off daily 8ema support but today we officially broke out through our double supply/ resistance of 530.36-531.39 and closed at a new ATHs. I would generally not be surprised by a fast wick to 531.39 but buyers and momentum here is pointing to further upside.

We are now back to ATH and price discovery mode if we do not immediately sell off tomorrow or on Friday due to data.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 530.36 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 522.61

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

On ES as I mentioned we technically did not make a new ATH as we matched exactly at the previous ATH level, however, we did close at a new ATH level today. We also had buyers return for the first time since 5/28 to support this breakout here.

With our range 5325-5344 breaking here with proper support we should continue to focus mainly on the upside here. Truly even with the last two days of data volatility the dip continues to be bought. This type of price action is setting us up for a decent rally into FOMC/ Cpi next week.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5251

 

**QQQ DAILY**

Looking at QQQ we also had daily buyers return to the market in a big way. This proper support of buyers finally bounced us off the daily 8ema support and propelled us not only through 459.82 range supply but propelled us to close at a new ATH and reach a new ATH.

I again would not be surprised to see a backtest of not only previous ATH but also this supply/ range resistance at 459.82 but generally I am looking at upside here.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS

NQ put in an impressive day here coming in just shy of 400 pts of total range to the upside. This was a straight pump from the bulls seeing only about 15pts of downside total from open to the LOD last night. This was an impressive move here honestly.

My general concern here for bulls tomorrow though is the fact that we are closing at our HOD and ATHs and generally those sort of days struggle the next day. Tomorrow likely (depending on data) is setting up for a pretty painful chop day. Generally after a major move in markets we get a choppy move the following day.

Today was as you can see not a good day… today is my legit kryptonite. These outta control extreme squeezy all gas no brake type of days really get me. I played two high probability double top plays that from a technical stand point was an A+ setup and I would say with confidence that 90% of the time will result in a retrace to at least make some profits… However, today is that 10% day.

I am going to take a little break from my MFFU accounts (I was able to get my billing stuff figured out today) and I am going to just trade my APEX likely until we get through FOMC and CPI. This price action and overall movement the last few weeks has been awful to trade and I fear truly we might see similar movement until we get through the collar roll at the EOM.",1717621462,827952,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,8414a2c0ce8ac23daedc39840c008f77d9a6b87bfb538109586e46163662dd27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1d90ucn/bulls_squeeze_into_new_aths_6524_spy_es_futures/

(Ticker: SSVR.v or SSVRF for US traders), a junior mineral exploration company, recently announced significant findings from its recent exploration activities at the Mogollon Project in New Mexico. 

The Company's systematic approach to exploration has resulted in the discovery of compelling mineralization, particularly beneath the project's Eberle Mine.

The assay results from one hole revealed an intersection of 1,133 g/t silver equivalent over 1.65 meters. This discovery underscores the mineral potential of the area and highlights the effectiveness of SSVR's exploration methodologies.

Galen McNamara, CEO of Summa Silver Corp., commented on the findings, emphasizing the importance of these results in understanding the geological landscape of the Mogollon Project. 

In addition, renowned investor Eric Sprott recently increased his holdings in SSVR, reflecting confidence in the Company's potential and strategic vision.

Sprott bought 3,000,000 common shares of SSVR via the TSX Venture Exchange, constituting approximately 2.8% of the outstanding shares on a non-diluted basis, for a total consideration of $1,200,000.

Looking ahead, SSVR plans to conduct further exploration activities throughout 2024, including follow-up drilling at the Queen Vein and other prospective targets. These efforts aim to delineate additional mineralization zones and unlock further value for stakeholders.

1914,**🚢🌊 $CTRM: The Unsinkable Shipping Stock Ready to Set Sail? 🌊🚢,"
Hey everyone,

Been looking into Castor Maritime Inc. ($CTRM), currently trading at $4.76, and think it might be a hidden gem. Here's why:

- **Shipping Boom**: High demand and supply chain issues are boosting the shipping industry.
- **Fleet Expansion**: $CTRM is rapidly expanding its fleet, potentially increasing revenue.
- **Improving Financials**: Recent reports show rising revenue and lower operational costs.
- **Undervalued**: Trading at a low price with significant upside potential.
- **Short Interest**: Could trigger a moon launch if we rally.

**Risks**: Volatile market, high debt levels.

I see $CTRM as a mid-to-long-term hold with big potential. What do you guys think? 🚀🌕

**TL;DR: $CTRM ($4.76) could see gains due to industry trends, fleet growth, and a possible moon launch. Watch the risks, but this could be a big win.**

1923,"Market Rejects Off ATHs… 6-6-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Overall as I had mentioned yesterday most days after having a massive meltup/ squeeze like we did yesterday the follow up day is often times tight ranged and miserable to trade… today was exactly that. I do suspect though market is patiently waiting for Unemployment Rate tomorrow though.

https://preview.redd.it/5ovfosi4o05d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a7a1ce870b4a16526d71970867de126dba5de03

As you can see we have not seen higher than a 3.9% unemployment rate since February 2022 when the UE rate was dropping not rising like it has been since February 2023. As of right now my thoughts are much like every UE day we are set up for a major 1% +/- move tomorrow.

If we finally see 4% UE rate then very likely we will see a major pump and squeeze to the upside tomorrow. The reason would be that the higher UE goes (weaker the economy is) the more likely that JPOWs feds fund rate is high enough and is “accomplishing the job.” However, if we see the rebound back down to 3.8% or even 3.7% we are likely to see a very red reaction to that data. The lower UE goes the “longer and higher” the fed can hold rates because the economy is strong enough to support those rates. I expect pre market and opening hour to be very volatile tomorrow.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/h95ngjy4o05d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3d060299acf23789204f9c18d5e791a0691160

Despite the fact that we technically close a red day… down $0.01… we actually had stronger daily buyers once again today. We also managed to make a new ATHs. The way the momentum and supply and demand is reading is that we are likely to push higher tomorrow. Much like I mentioned yesterday I expected us to wick lower to backtest previous resistance before heading higher. Now we did not quite hit that level but we certainly found support higher than previous resistance today.

Bulls will need to close over 535 tomorrow in order to remain bullish. Bears have to close under the daily 8ema support which should be right around double supply of 530.36-531.39.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 530.36 -> 531.39  
Demand- 520.82 -> 522.61

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Es did get the backtest off the previous double supply resistance which was confirmed as support today at 5344. We almost to the point bounced off that level. Now that we have backtested that level and bounced we should expect a daily double bottom off todays candle and likely a breakout to a new ATHs tomorrow.

Bulls need to close over 5369 tomorrow and bears will need to close under the double supply 5325-5344 in order to be in control.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5344  
Demand- 5239 -> 5251

QQQ looks fairly identical to SPY today in that we reached a new ATH, had stronger daily buyers but barely closed the day red. Momentum and supply/ demand continues to point at the upside being the highest probability for tomorrow.

Bulls will need to breakout and close over 464.5 tomorrow and bears need to close back under previous supply/ resistance of 459.82.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 459.82

NQ has a more pure double top here on the daily at 19086 here compared to the other three that are slightly off camber. I would have preferred to see NQ officially come down and bounce off 18953 before recovering but this daily doji here certainly opens the upside potential to push higher tomorrow.

Remember doji candles (when the wicks are even like this) are not usually reversal candles… while they are indecision candles… they usually actually promote continuation. It just means today there was more of a fight from both sides. It should be noted that on SPY and QQQ today that volume was low for this “red” day.

Bulls need to break through and close over 19086 and bears need to get back under that supply at 18953.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18953  
Demand- 18234 -> 18594

Today was a better day of trading. I had a good long this morning that ended up hitting my BE trigger but I caught a major wick before it pushed higher. I had another good long after taking two losses on longs that did the same thing… hit my BE, wicked lower and then ripped higher to my target. I was able to enjoy the big drop at 2pm.

While I would have liked to recover some of yesterdays losses and would have liked to see all 4 accounts green… I thought more on it last night and I have two accounts in the green for this week and two in the red. Overall its not that bad of a week at all. Tomorrow is a new day too.

Days like today are tough to play just cause the range is so tight overall that the 5 and 15min candle moves are smaller and harder to get rewarded.",1717708133,828059,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,c07c8701446aeedff6d3259e07185c1e78e98c699b0c5db05a53eb3c30e05b8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1d9t71o/market_rejects_off_aths_6624_spy_es_futures_and/

1930,"Zeus North America Mining Corp. Unveils Exploration Roadmap for 2024 at Cuddy Mountain Property, Neighboring Key Mining Entities and a Significant Copper Find","Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for US investors) recently shared its strategy for exploration in 2024, directing its focus towards its Cuddy Mountain Property. This asset strategically sits adjacent to Hercules Silver Corp.’s Hercules Project, which recently revealed a notable discovery in copper porphyry.

Hercules' breakthrough at the Leviathan Porphyry Copper site includes a remarkable intersection showcasing 185 meters of 0.84% Copper, 111 ppm Molybdenum, and 2.6 g/t Silver. 

Particularly noteworthy is a concentrated segment within this find, displaying 45 meters at 1.95% Copper. This discovery underscores the significant potential of the encompassing region, inclusive of Zeus’ Cuddy Mountain Property.

The Cuddy Mountain Property shares several geological parallels with the adjacent Hercules Property. Both properties feature Olds Ferry terrane rocks, including the Hercules Rhyolite and Seven Devils Volcanics. Historical silver occurrences and small-scale mines hosted in rhyolite are present on both properties and doth properties are situated along the Bayhorse Thrust Fault, a significant structural corridor linked with substantial mineralization.

The recent surge in regional staking activities, with key players such as Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto securing numerous mining claims, further validates the potential of Zeus' Cuddy Mountain Property. Notably, Hercules Silver Corp. ring-staked the Zeus property prior to their discovery announcement, emphasizing its strategic significance.

Dean Besserer, President and CEO of ZEUS, emphasized, “This is one of the largest staking rushes I’ve seen in my career. Many still don’t recognize the magnitude of this discovery as it has unveiled a new and previously unknown Porphyry Copper belt. The fact that we have the Property directly adjacent to such a great discovery and along the same major structure is exciting.""

ZEUS is poised to initiate a comprehensive exploration program at Cuddy Mountain. The company has engaged Dias Geophysical Ltd. for a thorough 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization (IP) and Resistivity Survey, scheduled for this summer. The primary aim of this survey is to pinpoint promising mineralization zones across the property.

Additionally, the exploration program encompasses meticulous soil sampling, mapping, and prospecting, alongside rock grab sampling and high-resolution ground magnetics. These activities are meticulously designed to amass an integrated dataset, facilitating the identification of high-priority drill targets.

ZEUS also plans preliminary reconnaissance prospecting and rock grab sampling at its Selway and Great Western properties in Idaho. These initiatives seek to assess the potential mineralization for silver, copper, gold, lead, and zinc. Future field programs will be tailored based on the outcomes of these assessments.

https://preview.redd.it/b6z1msmdj75d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=43e9471263bfab78fb88186f9bc97b92d619e631

We are setting up for once again a major data week ahead of us. We have another 10year and 30year bond auction sprinkled in and more importantly Wednesday is likely to be one of the most volatile  days of the year so far. We are going to get CPI and FOMC on the same day. As you can see right now there actually is fairly COLD CPI numbers expected. IF we get COLD CPI and a dovish fed (Remember we get the critical dot plot) then we are likely to see a very BULLISH and majorily green (2-3%) day. However, if they surprise us with another HOT CPI and then the DOT PLOT gets adjusted for that hot CPI we could see a major win for the bears. However, honestly it appears that going long on 90% of data days works…

I will have my CPI write up on Tuesday for you guys.

On SPY our weekly buyers once again came back in to support this upside move. This new ATH and potential weekly bull flag that we have been watching for almost 2 months now has officially been confirmed. The play this week was to wait for a backtest off weeky 8ema support and previous supply of 523.21 to see who was really in control.

With this bounce here off previous resistance to turn it into supply and a bounce off weekly 8ema we should continue to look for upside.

On the backs of a major data week ahead we should look for a move to 540-545 for the bulls. Bears need to close under 523.21 minimally.

On ES here we played out the weekly double bottom bounce off 8ema and previous supply. We also continue to maintain the integrity of the yellow weekly bull channel here further confirming with the held of stronger weekly buyers the breakout to the upside.

Bulls will look for 5400-5450 next week on CPI/ FOMC data and bears will target a move back under 5268.

Now QQQ had a much different looking close last week in that it got new weekly supplies. With that weekly supply and bearish engulfing weekly candle there was potentially a downside opportunity. However, the bulls here also held weekly 8ema support perfectly and not only that but they put in a new weekly demand at 450.77 and closed over last weeks supply (resistance) of 458.11 with stronger weekly buyers to confirm and justify this new ATH here.

Bulls will be targeting a breakout to 470-480 and bears need to minimally close under 450.77 demand now.

Similarly here on NQ after our weekly double top off 18881 new supply we have found ourselves forming a new demand at 18558. We have a very similar breakout and closure over last weeks supply/ resistance and stronger weekly buyers once again justifying this breakout and upside move.

Truly it becomes harder and harder to see a downside move in this market. I again fully expect CPI and FOMC to be bullish next week based on PA alone.

Bulls will be looking for a move to 19300-19500 and bears need to close under this weeks demand and support of 18558.

Wednesday was a really discouraging day for me as I just couldn’t seem to see the plays correctly. Honestly todays price action at times felt identical to Wednesday but I feel like I was able to unbiasely see the movement today better. I only took three total plays today which two were during power hour (For those of you who know me I never trade PH…). But today was a great day of reading “this is not my A+ setup I am not taking it.”

All in all I was able to turn in three green accounts today and 1 red. I have two accounts that had a great week of trading and I have 1 that saw small amount of red and then one that is certainly driving the struggle bus. Honestly this continues to be why I spread my risk out over multiple accounts.

One thing I will say is that I am trading 4 accounts… my first entry is 2 cons on APEX and 1 con on MFFU #1 copy traded. My 2^(nd) trade is 1 con on MFFU #2 and then my last trade is 1 con on MFFU #3… the thing I find most interesting is that my worse account right now is of course my MFFU #3 which is the last account I trade… if this account happens to get blown I actually have a desire to go down to 3 accounts… and not have a 3^(rd) account to trade separately. My win rate has always dropped significantly into EOD.

1948,$300+ per day - IOST method,"Hi, I want to share with you a MEXC method that I found on the vastness of Facebook. I have done p2p before and quite successfully, but this method broke all records regarding the daily spread.

I am not forcing anyone to use it!

I used a capital of 2400$ and in a day I earned about 300$ in 24h of work. I would not say that the work is the most fun, but with such a spread why not.

So, the method itself (I'll simplify it a bit)

In short, we will earn 0.5% for each transaction to the IOST network. For this we will use their coin IOST.

Steps:

1. Buy a IOST coin
2. Then go to Wallet, Spot and select the purchased IOST
3. Select Deposit and copy MEMO (It's important to specify every time
4. Go back and select Withdraw

* Network: IOST
* Adress: iost\_award
* MEMO: Enter the copied MEMO

Choose a small amount of coins for the test

And after 5-10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only +0.5% (in coins)

If anyone has been helped, you can throw me a couple $ for coffee)

1955,LUCA Mining Corp. Unveils Ambitious Production Targets and Operational Advances at Producing Gold Eq Mines💥⛏️,"Junior Producer and Explorer, LUCA Mining Corp. (Ticker LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors), continues its advancements at the Campo Morado and Tahuehueto mines in Mexico, where a variety of minerals, including gold, copper, and silver, are extracted.

LUCA anticipates producing between 60,000 and 70,000 ounces of AuEq in 2024 from its mining operations, with a target of 100,000 ounces of AuEq for 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/q28z8pz2rl5d1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=de950929d0c842ac39544134dc132e059442d948

The Campo Morado mine focuses on copper-zinc-lead concentrates alongside precious metals credits, undergoing an optimization program to enhance grades, recoveries, efficiencies, and cash flows.

Recent developments at the Tahuehueto Gold and Silver Mine reveal new high-grade gold mineralization over significant widths, expanding from one of the main structures currently under exploitation.

Positive cash flow generation is expected to commence at Tahuehueto this year, with plans to scale up production to 1,000 tonnes per day in the near future.

LUCA's recent Q1 2024 financial report highlights their growth and profitability, with a net income of C$7.3 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. 

Production increased by 20%, resulting in 14,148 troy ounces of gold equivalent. 

Total net revenue rose to C$22.04 million, a 21% increase from Q4 2023, with operating income reaching C$4.8 million and positive operating cash flow of C$4.04 million before working capital adjustments.

LUCA aims to enhance throughput and implement a copper-lead separation process at its Campo Morado mine to produce three distinct, higher-value concentrates.

Progress at the Tahuehueto mine includes nearing completion of major equipment installation and mill commissioning, aiming for a 1,000 tpd capacity, with pre-production averaging 250 tpd in Q1 2024 and rising to 450 tpd by quarter-end.

Overall, LUCA Mining Corp. maintains strong financial and operational performance, driven by strategic initiatives and operational improvements, positioning the company for sustained growth and profitability in the mining sector.

The way price action is moving at times it feels like we are being driven not be buyers and sellers but rather but options behind the scenes. This actually reminds me a lot of the beginning of the year and last summer where basically every single sell off was an opportunity to go long. Today once again showed countless high probability short setups from a technical and price action stand point only for them to fail. It is very interesting watching price action push in a way like this…

From a daily perspective honestly price action continues to be pretty ugly here too. I did see a potential daily bull flag set up that is with this daily 8ema support bounce playing out. Today the buyers once again returned to the market and put in a new demand at 533.59. With todays closure over previous supply of 534.95 we should with the support of daily buyers be looking for a breakout into the 537.5-540 area.

Bears minimally need to close under daily 8ema support which will sit right near 533.59 demand.

Honestly I think the price action here on Es is even uglier. I do like that we had a very strong double bottom play out and bounced directly off the daily 8ema support that I pointed out last week. However I don’t like that we closed only 0.5 pts higher than the supply that was put in last week. While this is a support bounce and obviously the upside is playing out well as we are also now nearing extreme bull momentum again… this is not quite the breakout candle one would like to have seen for bulls.

With stronger daily buyers today and the new demand at 5353 we should continue to look for a move towards 5400. Bears need to retake 5353.

A potential hint that today was going to be bullish was in the fact that QQQ and NQ did not put in new daily supplies on Friday. WE are actually seeing a false breakdown here on the supply/ demand indicator which is honestly a VERY strong indication of potential breakout potential to the upside here.

We did see stronger daily buyers come back in today and held previous resistance of 459.82 as support today. Bulls will begin to target 470 and bears need to reclaim 459.82.

Today was a nice start to the week with 3 of my 4 accounts being green and the one account in the red was down $5. I was caught once again on my one account (last one to trade) looking for a short and got caught be a failed breakdown. I would take the play again honestly because the play that I loss on initial is the exact same setup I took later for a win.

1984,"New ATHs on Pre-FOMC and CPI Day… 6-11-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Its kind of funny and ironic that at the last CPI/ FOMC meeting I said that there was really nothing standing in the way of this market rallying into this fomc/ cpi day. I really didn’t expect to see the strength we have seen and just the complete unwavering upside pushes we keep getting. Impressive honestly how relentless the last 2-3 weeks of upside have been… its honestly been the same every day… overnight/ opening 15-30 minutes of weakness and then we just buy the dip into EOD.

Tomorrow if finally CPI and FOMC day… this day is going to be VERY spicy… I highly recommend NOT trading tomorrow at all… there is a very good chance I myself will not trade it…

https://preview.redd.it/vln13eocc06d1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ce979b88da422f0273e5e323666d4c4c50ca5bd

My CPI Predictions  
CPI YoY- 3.4%  
CPI MoM- 0.2%  
CORE YoY- 3.7%  
CORE MoM- 0.4%

Now I am favoring much like the last 4 months of inflation readings that we are actually going to see a higher than forecast reading come in on CPI.

I honestly see two scenarios (well maybe three but we will talk about that) for tomorrow.

The first scenario is that we get a HOT CPI and CORE CPI that starts a massive morning sell off… this then leads into FOMC where we of course get the ever so important DOT PLOT. This dot plot is likely going to show not only are there ZERO rate cuts coming in 2024 (which I have been saying since 2023) but it is going to show many fed members starting to favor a rate HIKE this fall… this also leads to a MASSIVE sell off… think historically terrible day…

The second scenario is my opinion the most probable. We are going to get a cold to neutral CPI. Meaning yes we are not HIGHER than previous CPI but its either unchanged or mixed enough that markets initially react positively but likely will give it up slowly as we pushing into FOMC at 2pm. Now again I think DOT PLOT will show the obvious that there is NO rate cuts coming in 2024… the thing is that even if CPI comes in at unchanged. There is no way that in the next 6 months that we are going to have CPI low enough to justify (and give the fed confidence) in being able to cut rates this year. The dot plots is going to show this regardless… mathematically its just improbable for that to play out.

The last scenario which is a wild card here because the fed is also behind the game… is that we get a hot or cold CPI… and then at 2pm the FOMC meeting basically stays unchanged… there is a real possibility that JPOW is going to stick to the same script of data dependent. Technically his beginning of year projected was 2-3 rate cuts by EOY. We have a meeting in September and then in December. So can he technically deliver? Sure but its again highly unlikely and I think we will see that the dot plot will not show that. The scenario would be that the algos almost likely last meeting focus on a dovish JPOW and ignore the dot plot.

As we look at the last year of CPI day trends its pretty obvious that the highest probability is a green CPI day and a green post-CPI day.

https://preview.redd.it/ucyn73gdc06d1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=be8d6cbfabeac80c241f57eb818baf6015c35479

Now as we jump over to FOMC day trends you can see this is a bit more mixed… however the biggest thing I note is that post-fomc days almost always open pretty big green which with CPI days opening green… we have a really strong chance depending on how tomorrow goes (basically if we don’t drill into the core of the earth red) we could see a major pump into the EOW.

I am going to keep my TA very brief as honestly with CPI and FOMC tomorrow volatility will be so high we don’t need to do much but wait for the day to close and go from there…

1988,"Humanoid robots has a large market potential, WiMi seized the opportunity to develop its core technology","**Will robots become the next smartphones?**

The worldwide market for humanoid robots is forecast to be bigger than analysts in Goldman Sachs Research expected even a year ago. The prospects for machines that help with everything from folding laundry to handling hazardous waste have improved as progress in artificial intelligence accelerates and investment in the sector grows faster than anticipated.

The total addressable market for humanoid robots is projected to reach $38 billion by 2035, up more than sixfold from a previous projection of $6 billion, Goldman Sachs Research analyst Jacqueline Du, head of China Industrial Technology research, writes in the report. Their estimate for robot shipments increased fourfold, to 1.4 million units, over the same time frame, with a much faster path to profitability on a 40% reduction in the cost of materials.

On May 29, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) said the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Automation has made important progress in the field of microrobots inspired by the pacing of seals, developing a miniature crawling robot weighing only 1.2 grams.

From a global perspective, humanoid robots have also been expected to have commercial application scenarios. For example, the humanoid robot EVE developed by 1X technologies has been successfully used in patrol security scenarios.

Industry insiders pointed out that the current potential development direction of humanoid robots is mainly for manufacturing, space exploration, life service industry, university research. It is expected that in 2025, humanoid robots will be expected to achieve breakthroughs in the application of manufacturing scenarios, and small batch applications in electronics, automotive and other manufacturing environments.

It is important to note that, thanks to the AI model of technology mature, humanoid robot is the excellent carrier of its embodied intelligence, it will be the human-computer collaboration interaction mode from passive interaction to active interaction, natural language interaction, is the next generation of human-computer interaction center, even will become the real sense of’intelligent terminal, has great value in the long run.

With multi-dimensional empowerment, the potential of the humanoid robot market is being released at an accelerated pace. As pointed out by Wanlian Securities Research Report, 2024 is a accelerated year for the development of humanoid robots. The continuous investment in Tesla and other technology giants in the humanoid robot industry is expected to drive the industry to make continuous breakthroughs. The mass production and large-scale application of humanoid robots usher in the dawn, and the commercialization is expected.

**WiMi has a strong layout**

Undoubtedly, from last year to this year, the robot field has a new climax, humanoid robot is expected to form a new industry, bring a huge market space. According to the data, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), combined with its own development foundation and optimization, focuses on supporting superior technologies to carry out research on “embodied intelligence” intelligent robots, develops a multi-mode model based on artificial intelligence model, improves the base of general intelligent robot technology, and accelerates the large-scale application of humanoid robots.

In view of the current hot “humanoid robot” track, WiMi division track, niche, around humanoid robot form WiMi research and development innovation center, fully support innovative product research and development, concentrated breakthrough humanoid robot and general artificial intelligence model of key technology, preliminary build humanoid robot innovation system and industrial ecology, form the industrialization ability.

With the emergence of multi-mode, the development of general robots has a clearer prospect, and the AI model shows more possibilities to empower robots. At present, WiMi has deeply integrated into the real economy with humanoid robot related products, and launched multi-modal humanoid robot products for manufacturing, trade and logistics, health, family services, cultural and tourism services and other fields, forming a demonstration application, which is expected to provide support for responding to the transformation of the scientific and technological industry and exploring a new paradigm of scientific research.

 

**Conclusion**

In fact, the key to the breakthrough of humanoid robots includes not only the sports ability brought by the hardware innovation of the industrial chain, but also the wisdom of “people” brought by the emergence of AI intelligence. There are many key links and complex industrial chain. However, from the perspective of the world process, for humanoid robots and other fields, after years of development, a relatively mature market of high-quality products. From the perspective of the industrial chain, for humanoid robot enterprises, the mass production is gradually promoted, the cost gradually decreases, and the sales of humanoid robots rise.

Although not everyone sniped the bottom of that pullback, It is still up 30% from 2.40. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1d8cxd6/meme_stock_and_normal_stock_watchlist_momentum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is the first post for those interested!

* Volume: There has been an increase in trading volume, which further validates the upward movement.
* MACD: While still negative, is showing signs of a bullish crossover as the MACD line approaches the signal line from below. This suggests that further upward momentum could be on the horizon.

Next Steps:

* Target: The next target level to watch is around 0.0706, which represents the previous significant resistance.
* Hold or Take Profits: If you entered around 0.0185, you might consider taking partial profits to lock in gains while letting the rest of the position ride to higher levels.

2004,"CPI and FOMC Day… 6-12-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Today was probably one of the most anticipated days of the year so far with it being both CPI and FOMC… The bulls (no surprise) once again took over control and did not let the bears get away with anything today.

https://preview.redd.it/8tpayflqb76d1.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=32394a5790c8225d5322c7dc924da41b63927a94

We actually got not only a colder than previous CPI but we also got a colder than forecast CPI on all 4 metrics (we have not see that in about 5 months). However, as I mentioned yesterday and as you will see below during the FOMC meeting we are looking at best case scenario of ONE rate CUT in 2024 which is down from the projected 2023 the last two FOMC dot plot meetings. Not only that but there is a significant portion of the fed that see NO rate CUTS in 2024 and some who see no rate cuts in 2025 also…

Above is the physical dot plot projection from FOMC meeting.

Taking a look at what was said at FOMC and the FOMC presser today… Note- these are copy and pasted from social media.

·         Fed Officials' median view of Fed Funds Rate at end-2024 5.1% (prev 4.6%).

·         Fed projections imply 25 bps of rate cuts in 2024 from current level, another 100 bps in 2025.

·         Fed Officials median view of the Fed funds rate at end-2024 5.1% (prev 4.6%).

·         Fed Officials' median view of Fed Funds Rate in longer run 2.8% (prev 2.6%).

·         Fed projections show 4 of 19 officials saw no rate cut in 2024; 7 saw 1 cut; 8 saw 2 cuts.

·         Fed projections show 4 of 19 officials saw no rate cut in 2024; 7 saw 1 cut; 8 saw 2 cuts.

·         Fed Policymakers see 2.1% GDP growth in 2024, unemployment rate at 4%; both unchanged from March.

·         Fed policymakers see end-2024 PCE inflation at 2.6% versus 2.4% in the March projection, core seen at 2.8% versus 2.6%.

·         Fed's Powell: inflation has eased substantially but is still too high.

·         Fed's Powell: Our economy has made considerable progress. Continued strong job gains in the economy.

·         Fed's Powell: The Fed generally expects GDP to slow from last year's pace.

·         Fed's Powell: Consumer spending remains solid.

·         Fed's Powell: We expect labor market strength to continue.

·         Fed's Powell: The labor market is coming into better balance.

·         Fed's Powell: Recent monthly inflation readings have eased somewhat.

·         Fed's Powell: Risks to achieving the dual mandate are in better balance.

·         Fed's Powell: We will need to see more good data to bolster confidence on inflation.

·         Fed's Powell: So far this year we have not got greater confidence on inflation in order to cut.

·         Fed's Powell: The Summary of Economic Projections are not a plan or any kind of decision.

·         Fed's Powell: If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we're prepared to maintain the rate where it is as long as appropriate. The opposite is also true in terms of rate cuts.

·         Fed's Powell: We are practicing a slight element of conservatism on our inflation outlook.

·         Fed's Powell: We don't have high confidence in forecasts.

·         Fed's Powell: If jobs are to weaken unexpectedly, the Fed is ready to respond.

·         Fed's Powell: We have a fairly conservative forecast on inflation, if we get better readings, I think we will see the forecast come down.

·         Fed's Powell: The test for cutting rates is more confidence that inflation is moving toward 2%.

·         Fed's Powell: I'd look at all of the Fed forecasts for the rate path as plausible.

·         Fed's Powell: Policymakers are not trying to send a strong signal with forecasts.

·         Fed's Powell: Unexpected weakness in the labor market could also call for a response.

·         Fed's Powell: FOMC participants were allowed to update their SEPs to incorporate the CPI data today if they wanted to, most policymakers don't update their forecasts, though.

·         Fed's Powell: It's no longer the super heated labor market of a few years ago.

·         Fed's Powell: There's an argument that job gains may be a bit overstated, but they're still strong. Unemployment moved up a bit, that's an important statistic.

·         Fed's Powell: Today was a better inflation report than almost anyone expected, we have to see what today's data means for the balance of risk.

·         Fed's Powell: People are coming to the view that rates are less likely to go down to pre-pandemic levels.

·         Fed's Powell: Policy is restrictive. The question of whether it's restrictive enough will be answered over time.

·         Fed's Powell: We think our policy stance is about right.

·         Fed's Powell: We are seeing what we wanted to see in the economy right now, we are getting good results here.

·         Fed's Powell: There's been a surprising increase in import prices of goods.

·         Fed's Powell: Inflationary pressures have come down, but still getting elevated inflation in non-housing services.

·         Fed's Powell: Credit-card balances & defaults not at high levels.

·         Fed's Powell: if we see the unemployment more than we forecast, we would view that as unexpected weakening, of course we can't wait for that to happen, and that's why we always look at the balance of risks.

·         Fed's Powell: A decision to loosen policy could have several reasons.

·         Fed's Powell: It is not our plan to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.

·         Fed's Powell: We have the ability right now to approach rate-cut question carefully.

Generally speaking the day after CPI and the day after FOMC have both been very bullish days most of the time. I would for the most part not be surprised to see that trend continue tomorrow.

https://preview.redd.it/f217z26sb76d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b0e2e83bcd47809d5899c51854222b650599ea

Tomorrow is actually another major data day with PPI and jobless claims pre market followed by Yellen herself at noon.

**SPY DAILY**

Todays  daily candle honestly is a very impressive abandoned baby candle forming. That usually would result in a massive drop over night. One thing I am watching here is that we actually got a new daily supply at 536.92 today. This actually gives us an imbalanced close. This means that we either need to push up and put a new demand in tomorrow or we need to close under 536.92 tomorrow.

One thing that I find quite interesting on SPY today is the fact that we closed out the daily with weaker daily buyers. So essentially we put in a new ATH, close a new ATH and closed out a massive reversal candle with support or reasoning to believe that tomorrow is bearish.

Bears are going to target that balanced close below 536.92 tomorrow.

Bulls need to close over 544.12 tomorrow in order to be able to rebalance this market with a new demand.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 531.39 -> 536.92  
Demand- 533.59

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

We have a similar but different move here on ES. Now here on ES we did get a new daily supply at 5384 which again gives us an imbalanced close. However, we had very strong daily buyers come in today which actually justifies this new ATH. The one thing I am seeing here on ES is that we could potentially set up a massive over night double top here off 5431 and close back under 5384 supply tomorrow to rebalance the market.

Bulls are going to need to reject the double top and close over 5454 tomorrow to put a new demand in.

Bears will look to close under 5384 to rebalance the market.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5384  
Demand- 5251 -> 5353

**QQQ DAILY**

Tech has, as I have been saying for weeks, been driving this market or at least holding thism market up. Here on the Qs we also got a new supply at 468.07 which again cause an imbalanced close here. However, on the Qs we again saw stronger daily buyers which does justify this upside breakout today and the major gap up. This daily candle here on QQQ is not nearly as much of a reversal candle compared to the one that SPY closed. What is pretty intereswting is that we have moved up almost $30 since our last demand was put in. Generally speaking that is abnormally large upside push.

Bulls will need to negate the potential double top here and close over 476.5 In order to rebalance this market with a new demand.

Bears need to seek out that 468.07 supply.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 459.82 -> 468.07  
Demand- 450.65

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/2n72e6ntb76d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=109f2c73283d1f1f50386313cf41b9a80513573a

We are seeing quite the different candle here on NQ compared to the rest because of the after hours move. AVGO reported earnings and also reported a stock split which sent NQ on an almost 100pt rip.

On NQ we also saw stronger daily buyers come in today, however, again due to this larger after hours pump we actually are not seeing a new supply here. I generally would not be surprised to see this turn into a fairly large double top in order to send this lower tomorrow. Bears are so far over due to put in a new supply its not funny. This is the most over extended from a supply/ demand stand point that the market has been in a long time.

Bulls need to continue its push higher tomorrow closing minimally over 19588 to be in control still.

Bears will look to play out the double top in order to get a new supply and close between 19200 and 19300.

I have a tendency to lose funded accounts on FOMC (usually because of the volatility) so I am happy to report that I did not lose an account today. I ended up just completely sitting out of trading my MFFU funded accounts today. I ended up trading my APEX account though and took a decent hit this morning before I was able to recover a little bit before FOMC happened.

I had opened a new expert 50k account eval on MFFU in order to hopefully pass on a breakout for FOMC but I got stopped out even thankfully before the EOD drop.

2005,Why is GME so interesting? ,"So there is the question: isn’t GME just a memestock? In the beginning it was one, but now it turned out to be more than that.
It turned out to be a company which is less likely to go bankrupt than Amazon especially because of their huge cash reserves of 4 B$ and no real long time debt. 
Now there has to be looked for the new direction in which GME will go.
Will it bring something new? Acquire another company? 
That’s the things an investor should look for.
In my opinion the stock has potential. Right now big market players try to hold down stock, but we will soon see how that turns out to be. 
Therefore decide on your own if you should buy the stock or watch from the sidelines. 
But one thing is for sure: 
Something big will happen in the next weeks!

2006,Blackwolf Copper and Gold's (BWCG.v) and Treasury Metals' Strategic Merger Proposal Offers Significant Financial and Operational Enhancements,"Blackwolf Copper and Gold Ltd. (BWCG.v or BWCGF for US investors) has proposed a merger with Treasury Metals Inc. (TML), whereby TML will acquire all outstanding shares of Blackwolf. Each Blackwolf shareholder will receive 0.607 TML shares for each share they own. 

Because Blackwolf shareholders will get shares of TML at a  0.607:1 ratio, shares of BWCG on most trading days have been trading at a relative discount to the intrinsic value post merger. For example, TML is currently trading at 24.5c, which means that BWCG should be trading at 14.87c (24.5c \* 0.607), yet BWCG is trading at 13c.

Overall, this strategic merger aims to bolster both companies' financial and operational strengths. The combined company will have 2 advanced projects, TML's Goliath Gold Project and BWCG's Niblack Project.  
Key expected benefits of the merger include:

*Impending Gold Production:* The Goliath Gold Complex Project (GGC Project), according to TML's February 2023 pre-feasibility study, is set to produce 109,000 ounces of gold annually over a 13-year lifespan. The project boasts a net present value of $493 million and an internal rate of return of 33.5%, assuming a gold price of US$1,950 per ounce. The project benefits from established infrastructure and federal environmental approval, with final feasibility and permitting in progress.

*Robust Financial Standing:* Post-merger, the combined entity will have a cash position exceeding C$10 million. Additionally, TML plans to conduct a concurrent flow-through financing to raise up to $6.4 million before completing the merger.

*Focused Capital Market Strategy:* A new capital market strategy, led by cornerstone and prolific investor Frank Giustra, will leverage significant expertise in mine permitting, construction, operations, and exploration to enhance shareholder value. Giustra owns 13% of BWCG, and recently subscribed for $2M in TML’s financing, setting himself up to become a significant shareholder of TML as well. 

*Enhanced Exploration Initiatives:* The merger will intensify exploration efforts in the Dryden, Ontario area, with a focus on expanding the current mineral resource base. An experienced team will oversee these efforts to advance both development and exploration.

*Growth Through Strategic Acquisitions:* The combined entity will pursue strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth and solidify its industry standing.

*Experienced Management Team:* The management team will integrate the proven expertise and track records of both companies, enhancing capabilities in mining development, operations, finance, exploration, and community relations.

Approval for the merger will be sought from Blackwolf's shareholders and option holders at a special meeting on June 26, 2024. The Blackwolf Board of Directors and Special Committee unanimously recommend that stakeholders vote in favor of the arrangement

2011,POV: You watch MEIL's chart pulsing...,"It’s a little ironic that Cardiol Therapeutics is looking to put me into cardiac arrest in anticipation of their clinical trial results, but the volatility surrounding CRDL’s share price gives me optimism.

In other news, Methes Energies International Ltd. trades under MEIL and those boys gapped up 100%... to $0.0235.

BUT, I can’t see this being the scenario for long.

MEIL’s bio-lubricants are being used in US MILITARY vehicles. Government contracts, anyone?? For that reason alone I can’t see why they wouldn’t gap up, but I’ve been wrong before and so far the chart is a disaster.

Here’s some quick notes I found in the midst of my second round of MEIL DOUBLE-D.

* **They’re a clean solution to a potent problem.**

Maybe it’s my real-life proximity to the BP Oil Plant, but MEIL gives me optimism that we’re moving into a world where we’re not left cleaning up animals with Dawn Dish Soap (disclaimer: this is not a Dawn Dish Soap promo).

* **Early-on Regulatory Compliance**

Let's face it, the scrutiny around the petroleum industry is continuing to crescendo; the value of the shares from the oil company your ma and pop invested in 36 years ago aren’t worth what they used to be. When all the top dogs fall, somebody has to take their place on the pedestal. 

* **Overall Market Value**

The industry of bio-lubes in general is growing! They fall under the umbrella of EALs, or environmentally acceptable lubricants, which is set to grow as a sector in ROI by 100% before 2029!

Has anybody else gone long with these guys? Or is anybody else on a ventilator waiting for another CRDL surge? One way or another, y’all know my position is no secret - check the user. #AlwaysHodling

2020,"Post CPI/ FOMC Indecision… 6-13-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Historically speaking the last year of CPI and FOMC days have brought a bullish move to the markets. However, despite an impressively cold PPI print this morning the market actually reacted in a fairly negative motion. A bit interesting to say the least there.

https://preview.redd.it/iqsgf9vyde6d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1fccdf21b71ef3bc5f6e09d607c761977c6648

Market is holding fairly confident in the two rate cuts before EOY. Which I find even more interesting because JPOW and the fed yesterdays dot plot showed that the best case scenario was 1 rate cut in 2024 with many of the staff believing that 0 rate cuts is just as probable. We once again see a market that does not believe the fed… the market went from beginning of the year doubling the feds projection of rate cuts (fed said 3 and market said 6) to then saying the fed was wrong (fed said 3 and market said 1-2) to now the fed saying 0-1 rate cuts and the market still is doubling that prediction. The market continues to find the most bullish hopium to push us higher and higher.

From a daily perspective on SPY and QQQ especially all I can say is that this is absolutely an UGLY daily price action and trend… The 1230 till power hour pump we had today was very interesting in my opinion and was a bit surprising.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/g5qejw8zde6d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8d423be257fd18995d66a5fdac69c86ba7f28ab

Truly this is just some ugly price action here… the daily ended up putting in a new demand at 541.28 today to rebalance us. However, we did not see despite a new ATH close daily buyers to support that. This is now back to back days of buyers weakening now.

We are also sitting on the edge of extreme bull momentum here but are not quite fully in it just yet.

Bulls need to close over 544.12 tomorrow and bring back in daily buyers.

Bears need to close minimally under 541.28 and will target a gap fill down to 536.92.

One advantage to trading futures is that you get price action 24/6, however, one disadvantage is that if I write my TA before 5pm when the candle closes we at times can end up having slight changes to structure. Yesterday we appeared to have a daily supply put in that caused in imbalanced close… however thanks to AVGO earnings pumping it 14% we did not actually close out that move. Much like that today on ES we are not seeing a new supply on the daily now because ADBE is pumping on earnings.

This is actually really interesting as we have a really strong bearing potential evening doji star reversal pattern formed here… we also have a nice hanging candle on SPY to pair with this reversal pattern.

The interesting thing here is on SPY we had weaker daily buyers for the last two days however right now we are still seeing stronger daily buyers for 6 of the last 7 days.

Today is also a bullish candle in that we bounced off the daily 8ema support today but we also are seeing a reversal candle which is bearish. When I said price action on the daily is very ugly I really meant it.

Bears need to close under 5400 tomorrow and bulls need to close over 5455.

Similar to SPY on the Qs here we did get a new daily demand at 472.03 which has officially rebalanced our market. However, we did not see stronger daily buyers to really justify this upside move here. On QQQ we are now officially at a new ATHs and a new ATH close without proper justification for that move. QQQ is also attempting to firmly enter extreme bull momentum which if it does can again cause some strange movements.

Bulls need to see buyers come back in and close over 478.39 tomorrow. Bears will want to close under that 472.03 demand.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 468.07  
Demand- 472.03

We are looking at a very similar ugly move (truly the best way I can describe this) on NQ here… we have stronger daily buyers but as you can see we did not get the new supplies yesterday nor today due to earnings pumps after hours. This doji candle is a really tough one here to play over night and into tomorrow. Generally dojis are not always reversals when they are even wicked like this. We would have preferred to see a much stronger and bigger wick to the upside here.

The one thing I noticed the last two days is that ES is now driving this market… it is no longer tech leading the rally… this is very important to note.

Bulls need to close over 19691 and bears need to close minimally under 19400.

Today was one of my best trading days I have had in a while and honestly until 1230 when we started a pretty unnatural move higher price action finally felt real again.

I played mostly NQ today as I felt it had the best moves to trade for risk to reward though ES did move very nicely.

I continued to work on my eval I started yesterday. I forgot how frustrating these evals can be. I came about 3 times within passing the eval withing 50-200 and fell short. The one time I closed early before it hit and the one frustrating time I miscalculated my TP and was short and then was on the wrong side of my next trade. I really did not see the upside move and I was in a short as I really didn’t see any reason for us to keep going higher despite the fact we did. Overall made good progress on it but should have passed it a few different times today. But there is always tomorrow!",1718310059,828699,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,d43e33d00b1e352a83a8425d80302b4c9685aa24f10fb701e9196bc1d455c7b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1df8oa0/post_cpi_fomc_indecision_61324_spy_es_futures_and/

2022,Aero Energy (AREO.v) Begins Drilling at Murmac Uranium Project in Athabasca Basin,"Yesterday, Aero Energy Ltd. (Ticker: AERO.v or AAUGF for US investors), a mineral exploration and development company, announced the commencement of drilling at its Murmac Uranium Project, located in Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin. This initiative marks a significant milestone for Aero Energy, aiming to uncover high-grade uranium deposits within its expansive 250,000-acre land package in the historic Uranium City district.

https://preview.redd.it/byk0w56a8f6d1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=7686bb76c162477fa9ae0390e4714c16520b01f8

**About the Murmac Project**

The Murmac Project is strategically located between the historical Gunnar and Lorado Uranium Mines and has shown significant promise based on historical exploration from 1960 to 1980. Although numerous high-grade uranium occurrences were identified, they were not systematically explored for the basement-hosted mineralization typical of the Athabasca Basin. A 2022 drilling program by Fortune Bay confirmed the potential for high-grade uranium, validating the exploration model and reinforcing the prospectivity of the Murmac Project.

**Exploration and Drilling Program**

The current drilling program at Murmac will encompass approximately 2,600 meters through ten to thirteen drill holes, with operations led by Fortune Bay Corp. The primary focus is to explore high-grade basement-hosted uranium deposits, with the program being adaptable based on real-time findings. The selection of drill targets was informed by a high-resolution VTEM survey which was completed in April, along with 3D modeling of ground gravity data. These targets are further supported by historical uranium occurrences and previous positive drilling results.

The drilling has begun at target P7, with subsequent drilling planned for targets A15 and P4. These locations were chosen based on geophysical signatures, geological features, and their proximity to past uranium discoveries.

**Discovery of Intense Radioactivity**

During the initial scouting of drill sites, AERO discovered two occurrences of strong to intense radioactivity at the surface. Target A15 recorded 60,793 counts-per-second (cps) within hematized foliation parallel fractures, while target P4 measured 13,533 cps within hematized fault-hosted fractures perpendicular to foliation.

These readings, measured by a handheld RS-125 Super-SPEC gamma ray spectrometer, underscore the high potential for significant uranium deposits at Murmac.

**CEO’s Statement**

Galen McNamara, CEO of Aero Energy, expressed enthusiasm about the drilling commencement, stating, “The identification of new zones of strong radioactivity adjacent to drill pads and in close association with the targets below underscores the prospectivity of the Murmac Project. Thanks to the robust earlier exploration work by Fortune Bay and the collaborative target selection process, we are poised to embark on this exciting phase of our drilling program and look forward to the potential discoveries ahead.”

**Future Exploration Plans**

In addition to the Murmac Project, AERO is prioritizing further exploration at its Sun Dog and Strike projects, with plans for an additional 2,000 meters of fully funded drilling. This expanded drilling effort highlights Aero’s commitment to leveraging modern exploration techniques to uncover high-grade uranium deposits across its properties.

Aero Energy’s proactive approach and strategic exploration initiatives position it as a promising player in advancing uranium exploration within the Athabasca Basin, aiming to meet the growing global demand for this critical energy resource.

2035,Need to get this Rocket Lab DD off my chest...,"Alright everyone, buckle up for my thirst-quenching due diligence report on my second favorite 'meme stock' after $GME...

...but let's be clear, this isn't just any old YOLO play.

Rocket Lab USA, Inc. ($RKLB) is an American aerospace manufacturing company founded by Peter Beck in 2006. They specialize in providing small satellite launch services and space system solutions.

While Rocket Lab has been around for a while, it's only recently that they've seen a massive surge in revenue.

From $62 million in 2021, they jumped to $245 million in 2023.

That's a hefty 295% increase in just two years!

And yet, their stock is trading at an all-time low...

What's even more intriguing - analysts are predicting another 79% revenue growth in 2024.

With the aerospace industry gaining momentum, Rocket Lab seems poised for growth in the coming years.

However, not everyone is as convinced as myself...

Short sellers currently hold 16% of $RKLB.

I'm no gambler, but this is a risky bet - especially considering the revenue growth and projections for profitability by 2026.

Rocket Lab boasts a strong balance sheet with $492 million in cash and short-term investments.

Their recent revenue figure of $92.8 million (a 69% increase year over year) and GAAP EPS of -$0.06 are respectable, beating analysts' projections by $0.02.

But the real risk lies in Rocket Lab's current project, the Neutron Rocket.

Designed for payloads of up to 13,000 kg, Neutron is aimed at commercial and government constellation launches, with potential for human spaceflight.

There's some skepticism about meeting their 2025 launch deadline, but the company reported a 31.7% non-GAAP gross margin for the same period - a great indication of improved operational efficiencies.

I've been holding onto $RKLB since May, and I'm more than excited about their fundamentals.

Now, I'm just waiting for it to start gaining some momentum.",1718392358,828792,Big_Quench,t2_7d74lkm3,79bbf9877012458d93375e1c256ea25318eafde4bc1265e1f114af11792e4c71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dfyqf2/need_to_get_this_rocket_lab_dd_off_my_chest/

2039,"Article Summary: ""Luca Mining (LUCA.v) Is the Fast Growing Junior Producer With Two Mines"" (Gold, Copper, Silver)","The Oil and Gas Corporate Bulletin recently highlighted Luca Mining (Ticker: LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors) as a fast-growing junior producer with two rapidly expanding mines in Mexico. The company is capitalizing on the recent surge in metal prices, particularly gold, and its unhedged position allows it to fully benefit from these price increases.

**Production Expansion**

Luca Mining's two key assets are the Tahuehueto and Campo Morado mines. The Tahuehueto mine, located in northern Mexico, is set to increase its production capacity from 450 tons per day (tpd) to 1000 tpd in the coming weeks, more than doubling its output. Meanwhile, the Campo Morado mine in southern Mexico, which produces copper, gold, silver, and zinc, is ramping up from 1390 tpd to 2000 tpd, marking a 43% increase. Campo Morado is already generating positive cash flow, adding to the company's financial strength.

**Financial Projections**

Luca Mining's recent 2024 guidance projects the combined output of the two mines to be between 60,000 and 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent (AuEq). 

https://preview.redd.it/0uw571a2mm6d1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=608ee74eca2f5475f27724ba95744eadfcfb7fb0

This production is expected to generate between $95 million and $105 million (C$130 million to C$145 million) in revenue. The company anticipates total cash costs (TCC) between $1,200 and $1,265 per ounce of AuEq produced and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) between $1,320 and $1,420 per ounce. With gold prices currently around $2,300 per ounce, Luca Mining stands to achieve significant profitability.

**Valuation and Market Potential**

The article highlights that even under a conservative scenario—assuming the highest cost guidance and the lowest production guidance—Luca Mining could generate US$62 million in operating income, equating to CAD$84 million. After accounting for selling costs, the net operating income would be approximately US$40 million (CAD$54 million).In a best-case scenario, with higher production and lower costs, Luca Mining could achieve US$54 million (CAD$72 million) in net operating income.

**Strategic Advantages**

Several factors position Luca Mining for continued success:

\- A declining Mexican Peso, which could enhance cash flow.

\- New management and board members from the prestigious Lundin Group of Companies.

\- Engineering consultants, Ausenco, have implemented effective strategies to boost recoveries at Campo Morado.

**Future Prospects**

Luca Mining has ambitious plans to further increase production at both mines. Tahuehueto's capacity could double to 2000 tpd, while Campo Morado aims to reach 2400 tpd. Additionally, the company has significant exploration upside, with recent high-grade discoveries at Tahuehueto. By the end of 2025, Luca Mining expects its production to jump another 30-40%, potentially reaching 100,000 ounces of AuEq.

**Conclusion**

As operations ramp up and production increases, Luca Mining is well-positioned to deliver substantial cash flow and shareholder value. The company's strategic moves and favorable market conditions make it a compelling investment opportunity in the junior mining sector. Investors should keep an eye on Luca Mining as it continues to execute its growth plans and capitalize on its operational strengths.

Campaign Legal Center (CLC) filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Congressional Ethics.

They requested an official investigation in Rep. Roger Williams for failing to disclose up to $45,000 worth of stock transactions.

The STOCK Act gives Congress 30 days of receiving notice of the transaction

Within 45 days of the transaction date.

It also mandated the posting of the filings on the Internet.

In most cases, the requirements also apply to trades by spouses and dependent children.

""Rep. Williams serves on the Financial Services Committee. Based on publicly available information, it is unclear whether Rep. Williams’s failure to file was an attempt to avoid scrutiny of trades connected with non-public information or with potential conflicts of interest.""

""Because Rep. Williams was almost certainly aware of the requirement to file PTRs for stock transactions, it raises the question of whether he may have knowingly avoided disclosing his stock trades at the time they were made.""

""An OCE preliminary review can gather information to determine whether Rep. Williams knowingly violated the STOCK Act.""

I've been trying to get more into active investing lately, but honestly, the whole valuation side of things leaves me scratching my head.  Price-to-earnings ratios, DCFs...it all feels like a whole other language.

Has anyone here tried something like this? Is it a good starting point for beginners, or is it just a bunch of fancy formulas that don't really tell the whole story?

2048,Small Caps That Have Found Their Support Level: $AEMD + $RNXT+ $MEIL ,"I really wanted to include $GME into this analysis because it has been holding it's recent trendline, but I am not convinced just yet. I will probably have a better idea if there are still any buyers this week. There are so many reasons to use TA even if you aren't a big fan of it, but using it in conjunction with fundamental analysis has been my sweet spot. 

Here are a few of the many other reasons why I always look at support and resistances! (I know there are a lot of experts here already know this stuff, but some people are still looking to learn)! 

1. Market Sentiment: These levels reflect the psychology of market participants. Support levels indicate areas where buyers are strong enough to halt a decline, while resistance levels indicate areas where sellers prevent the price from rising further.
2. Risk Management**:** Knowing these levels allows traders to set stop-loss orders just below support levels or above resistance levels. This helps manage risk by limiting potential losses if the market moves against their position.

I could go on, but I don't wanna bore you so lets jump into the set ups now!

2064, LLY vs. MEIL - My David vs. Goliath Tickers to Watch,"In the midst of my interest in the biotechnology sector, a different healthcare titan has proven in the same period that they’re more than just a large piece of the S&P 500.

And, without question, they have the audience and innovation to become a long-term value play.

**Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY)**

The longstanding drug manufacturing stock is seeing resistance from it's all-time high share price of $891.90, but the stock is sounding off the bull signal after climbing back to $887.89 per share in after-hours 6/17. This is likely due to the [unveiling of their newest manufacturing plant](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/eli-lilly-unveils-north-carolina-210054637.html) in Concord, North Carolina. The SPX powerhouse has stated that the launch of the factory will relieve manufacturing “bottlenecks” for their high-in-demand GLP1 weight-loss drugs.

Bottlenecks, huh? Did anybody else read “The Goal” by Eli Goldratt?

I’m gonna assume I’m not that special, but Eli Lilly stated there’s been supply chain problems in their manufacturing of the drug’s injectable pens, and the new plant will heighten production.

**Methes Energies International, Ltd. (OTC: MEIL)**

With my peaked interest in BioTech came a unique discovery of *bio-lubes.* This environmentally-focused company is on a mission to innovate and combat the petroleum-based lubricant industry with sustainable and high-quality lubricants made entirely from biodegradable materials. Methes Energies also has put their lubricants through the rigorous testing process that comes along with the U.S. military, but the stock has had trouble picking up the steam suggested from their innovative fundamentals.

Obviously a NYSE stock is hotter on the radar than the likes of OTC, but I still hold true that both my David and Goliath are fondling with a bull’s horns ;)

Friendly reminder that tomorrow is a bank holiday and therefore the markets are closed!

Now lets talk about this market… this market is just absolutely incredible. The move we had yesterday is the type of squeeze/ rally you would expect after about 2-3 solid days of red where everyone piles into shorts and puts and then they get wrecked causing the market to rip… the oddity about yesterday is we did not have that at all… we just continue to grind higher and higher and higher… new ATH after new ATH… the question truly is how long can this sustain?

**SPY DAILY**

This market continues to push to really impressive levels from a technical standpoint here… from a technical perspective I would say that Middle of November 2023 is about as similar of a time to this as we have had… but this level is even more over extended to the upside.

Impressively the bulls have closed out 7 green days in a row and there has only been one red day in the last 13 trading days.

The odds of a decent pull back grow as we continue to push up here running on fumes. Bulls are still working on my 550 target and bears will need to target that drop back to 541.39 still.

Remember that futures rolls contracts officially on Friday. Tradingview and TOS has already rolled the contracts forward. There is a gap on my TOS chart and I do NOT adjust my levels for contract rolls. I have covered this before but in general I don’t find it necessary. However, for the next about week of price action most of my focus does come from the daily of SPY and QQQ.

We have reached my 5550 target here but that is more due to the contract roll here… the next upside move is 6000 on ES… bears need to see a large pullback to 5436 still to fill the gap from roll… a lot of the time that contract gap is filled.

Supply- 5325

After tech showing so much strength for the last 3 weeks we are finally now seeing some small weakness here in tech. Yes NVDA was up almost 4% at one point and did over take MSFT as the worlds biggest stock by market cap…. But in generally NQ was not in charge of todays rally… This is my first sign of the potential pullback looming closer and closer…

My next target here is 490 on NQ for the bulls… bears will look to bring this back down to 471.93.

Similar here on NQ due to the contract roll we have a major gap and on NQ we have UGLY price action here on the daily… we put in a supply at 19700 yesterday even though we closed with such a big move to the upside. Today is the first day in 8 trading days that buyers have closed out weaker than the previous day… the question is will we push higher or not… I do like this as a temp top and a pullback Thursday (Remember markets closed tomorrow).

Bulls next target is 20500-20600… bears will look to bring this back down to 19592-19700.

2074,Emerging Copper Supercycle and Strategic Exploration: ZEUS North America Mining Corp. (ZEUS.c) Announces 2024 Exploration Plans,"As highlighted by Sprott Energy Transition Material Monthly, a new copper supercycle is being driven by several intertwined geopolitical and market trends, including electrification, national security concerns, environmental policies, supply constraints, and deglobalization. Moreover, the U.S. is implementing tariffs and import bans to bolster domestic industries and counter China's dominance in the energy transition sector.

https://sprott.com/insights/sprott-energy-transition-materials-monthly-a-new-copper-supercycle-is-emerging/

Looking at copper exploration in the US, an industry that could be significantly bolstered by the copper supercycle and US tariffs,  Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for U.S. investors) recently announced its 2024 exploration strategy for its Cuddy Mountain Property. This site is adjacent to Hercules Silver Corp.’s Hercules Project, which recently uncovered a significant copper porphyry deposit.

Cuddy Mountain shares several geological features with the nearby Hercules Property, such as Olds Ferry terrane rocks, historical silver deposits in rhyolite, the Bayhorse Thrust Fault, and exposures of mineral-rich formations beneath newer basalts.

Hercules' exploration at its Hercules Project yielded a notable intersection: 185 meters at 0.84% Copper, 111 ppm Molybdenum, and 2.6 g/t Silver, including a 45-meter segment at 1.95% Copper. This finding emphasizes the potential of ZEUS’ neighboring Cuddy Mountain Property.

This discovery has triggered a rush of staking in the area, with significant claims made by Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto, highlighting the region's high potential.

https://preview.redd.it/xk1b6dr7oe7d1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=596f0c5ef8897ec57bdef0a4ad80bf948727b94e

Dean Besserer, President and CEO of ZEUS, noted that this staking rush is one of the most significant he has seen in his career, despite it not yet being widely recognized. He expressed enthusiasm about ZEUS having a property directly next to this major discovery and on the same crucial geological structure.

For their 2024 exploration plan, ZEUS intends to commence a thorough exploration at Cuddy Mountain, hiring Dias Geophysical Ltd. for a 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization (IP) and Resistivity Survey during the spring and summer to locate mineralization zones.

The program includes comprehensive soil sampling, mapping, rock grab sampling, and high-resolution ground magnetics to identify high-priority drilling targets.

2079,"Nvidia COMPUTEX event officially announced Rubin AI chips, AMD/ WiMi joins the new revolution","Graph chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled its future plans, announcing its determination to embrace artificial intelligence at the COMPUTEX 2024 show on June 3.

Founder Jen-hsun Huang announced that the RTX series of graphics cards will strongly support Microsoft (MSFT)’s new Copilot + initiative, which aims to bring a range of powerful local features to Windows 11 systems.

Blackwell Chips are starting in production

In his speech, Huang also announced that Nvidia will launch its Blackwell Ultra AI chip in 2025. The next-generation AI platform, called Rubin, will use HBM 4 memory. Rubin’s next-generation platform is under development and will be released in 2026, and the Rubin AI platform will use the HBM 4 memory chip.

At the forefront of a major shift in computing, the intersection of AI and accelerated computing will redefine the future. It is predicted that the scale of the global AI industry will be as high as $100 trillion in the future, more than 330,000 times higher than the previous $3 trillion in the IT era, with a strong market prospect. At the end of the speech, Huang Renxun stressed.



AI chips have enabled an investment frenzy

From the cloud demand and enterprise action, currently, a fierce “AI war” has been completely started in the world. In 2024, the research and development of next-generation large models and AI chips will still be the core of the competition among major technology companies, among which the trend of gradually increasing the proportion of multimodal models will lead to a greater demand for computing power.

However, in model training, chip expenditure is a big project. Nvidia’s H100 graphics chip is priced at about $30,000. Mr.Zuckerberg has previously said it plans to buy 350,000 H100 chips by the end of the year. Last week, Musk’s xAI company announced a $6 billion financing round, and Musk said he would spend at least $9 billion to buy 300,000 Nvidia B200 AI chips.

https://preview.redd.it/49xkxh211h7d1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=af15c35a0993db1aa4dd12914f4ef0806461b549

However, as the AI boom continues to heat up, more and more manufacturers are also starting to make efforts in the AI chip field: Intel, AMD and other semiconductor giants announced a new round of AI chip research and development plans, and then downstream customers such as OpenAI and Amazon promoted their own chips to break Nvidia’s monopoly. AMD, for example, says it is accelerating the launch of new artificial intelligence (AI) processors.

Industry insiders point out that the ultimate goal of the tech giants is to take the lead in achieving general artificial intelligence (AGI). While it’s unclear how long AGI will take, more and more tech giants are fighting each other, and it is predictable that AI chips will become a decisive factor in tech competition in this new innovation cycle.



WiMi join the AI innovation 

At present, the development of artificial intelligence has fully entered the stage of large-scale commercialization, and AI technology is taking root and being widely applied in thousands of industries. According to the data, as the world’s leading AI innovation company, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) has been adhering to technology research and development upgrading, has made achievements in the field of AI artificial intelligence, and continued to meet the deeper AI digital intelligence needs of customers at different scales and different stages of development.

In fact, in recent years, WiMi in AI and cloud infrastructure overweight layout, the investment covers from AI chip, model, to the humanoid robot, autopilot, AI digital people and other fields, and multimodal large model to generate text, image, video, voice generation AI added to the application, in health care, media, education, manufacturing and other fields, actively release the economic potential of AI.

And for the chip industry ushered in a very exciting moment, the whole industry will be transformed. In this regard, WiMi has developed chips and ecological construction, established a research and development center, centering on the basic technology and facilities of the large model, accelerated the construction of computing power based on the powerful technology base, and accelerated edge computing in the chip, cloud computing to meet the growing demand of AI computing in industry and manufacturing industries.

The AI chip industry chain is long and complex, and there are many opportunities. In the future, WiMi will cooperate with leading enterprises to catch up and produce chips with good performance, jointly help industrial and scientific computing fields to develop and deploy edge AI computing power, and make great progress to ensure the efficiency of production and operation.

To sum up

Nvidia’s stock has quadrupled over the past year or so as the tech giants roar to spend money on the AI track. And Nvidia’s commitment to launch new AI chips at a “one-year generation” pace, faster than the previous two years, highlights Nvidia’s efforts to maintain its lead in the highly competitive AI chip market. Looking ahead, the development trend of AI will gradually enter a critical stage, and each stage has its own unique investment opportunities, and the battle between the giants is imminent.

2088,Today in Copper & Silver: Pismo Metals (PRIZ.c) Raises ~$1.15M Funding for Key Drilling Programs in Arizona and Mexico,"Today, Prismo Metals Inc. (Ticker: PRIZ.c or PMOMF for US investors) announced the closure of its non-brokered private placement, raising $1,147,500 to fund drilling at its Palos Verdes silver project and the Hot Breccia copper project in Arizona.

The planned drill programs at the Hot Breccia and Palos Verdes projects are crucial milestones in the company's growth strategy, aimed at uncovering significant mineral resources and increasing shareholder value.

https://preview.redd.it/kvrcqcuz0m7d1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47a3811bf6f652709860ea4c5c1b8adb82c8b09f

At Palos Verdes, PRIZ plans to drill approximately 3,600m in ten holes to be completed in 2 phases, targeting the Palos Verdes vein at depth.

Meanwhile, permitting for the Hot Breccia Copper Project is expected to go through this month.

PRIZ plans to do 1,000m-deep diamond drilling in five holes. 

PRIZ's Hot Breccia project in Arizona's copper belt shows promise for substantial copper mineralization. Arizona, a tier-1 mining jurisdiction, supports a robust copper mining industry with ten major mines producing 23 to 632 million pounds of copper annually. 

Recent exploration at Hot Breccia yielded samples with copper concentrations up to 5.69%, along with 0.24 g/t gold and 32.8 g/t silver, indicating significant porphyry-related mineralization at depth. 

PRIZ's exploration strategy aims to unlock Hot Breccia's full potential, offering attractive opportunities for stakeholders.

2089,Healthcare and AI go together for AMIX ;),"I’ve kept up my research on the biotechnology sector and healthcare in general, but while sifting through my winners and losers, the field of electrophysiology and Autnomix Medical revealed themselves. 

As a result, I went snorkeling for research on this . I’ll pull out the scuba gear for a deep-dive later on.

**Autonomix Medical Inc. (NASDAQ: AMIX)** carries the torch for the emerging electrophysiology industry. The medical device company is integrating AI and healthcare treatment to improve the quality of millions of lives by empowering the revolution of nerve-targeted treatments.

Autonomix has developed highly innovative technology in the form of their catheter-based microchip sensing array that is said to have 3,000 times the sensitivity of any device currently available. 

This microchip is remotely guided by approved medical professionals to meticulously separate target nerves, eliminating misfiring sensory nerves through ablation (burning).

Autonomix’s integration of artificial intelligence gives them the potential to continuously adjust and improve both healthcare expenditures and treatment alike. Furthermore, AMIX is one of the first healthcare PTOs to incorporate AI into their treatment, which can trigger a gap-and-go for their chart in the near future, given proper leverage of their technology.

The company’s internal fundamentals get me excited, and on top of that, they reported strong results from their clinical trials the morning of 6/18!

However, it was the same morning that an institutional level of shares were dumped off, bringing AMIX share price $1.12

Is the giant red-candle for Tuesday a sign of caution for us retail investors? Or do we now have a discounted entry on a stock that has enormous market potential?

One way or another, I’m watching AMIX very closely on Thursday, both with great caution and interest.

I've been doing crypto staking for a long time and I can say that this is one of the best and stable methods I have ever seen

I'm not encouraging anyone to repeat after me, just sharing a type of making money from cryptocurrency

I used a capital of $800 and in a day I earned about \~$100 per day

So, the method itself (I'll just copy it from the main source and change it a bit for better understanding)

In short, we get 0.5% when using the IOST network on the MEXC exchange

Steps:

1. Registration on the MEXC exchange
2. Deposit USDT
3. Buy IOST for USDT
4. Go to Wallet > Spot > IOST > Deposit
5. Copy IOST MEMO
6. Step back > Withdraw
7. Fill in the fields as follows:

* Address: coin\_reward
* Network: IOST
* Memo: Copied memo. Important! You must specify each time!
* Amount: Test on small amount

1. Send and wait ±10m
2. Getting the entire amount back, but with an additional 0.5%
3. Repeat everything from step 4

Thus, with each transaction, we increase our capital by 0.5%. It's not a bad method. But it takes a lot of time to work with it

2109,"Bears Rally into Quad Witching Day… 6-20-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I wont lie that quad witching day snuck up on me… this should bring an interesting close to the week tomorrow with Quad day. Generally speaking quad days can be pretty volatile and a wee bit difficult to trade.

https://preview.redd.it/7w0cwtud9s7d1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cda3b014c13665116fe8eb62441eee1f04233c1

In the last almost 3 years we have only closed our quad witching day green three times… we should be setting up for a follow through red day tomorrow.

Honestly today was a MUCH needed break from this squeezy nonsensical push to the upside without any real support or justification. Today finally reconciles a lot of the market imbalance and issues we have been seeing.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/47pcdp5e9s7d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ace9ca28a5e8cca61e9c6423cb6f6a822aa35b4

We finally after once again hitting a new ATHs today were able to see the rejection bears have been waiting for. This rejection today does not only cause a bearish engulfing candle but it also puts in a new supply at 548.52.

Now I do think based on history that we will get a red day tomorrow, however, I do not think bears should get too comfortable here… we remain in extreme bull momentum on the daily and we also are far over the daily 20ema support. We could realistically lose 8ema support near 543 and still be bullish. However, if we happen to lose daily 20ema support which will be near the 536.92 supply then we could be talking about a more sustained downside move.

Bulls need to double bottom bounce and close back over 548.52 supply. Bears are targeting a move back to previous demand at 541.39.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 548.52 -> 536.92  
Demand- 533.59 -> 541.39

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/mbu3i8ie9s7d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=55927ee72dc39f493221bd558ed2273e05a778ec

ES after having the freedom to trade on the holiday without the rest of the market pushed us to new ATHs. We have finally found our resistance. This 5562 is our new supply and is also our three day long resistance. While I still stand firm that this is merely a temporary pullback before new ATHs take us higher into fall… I do think we could see that contract roll gap fill near 5443 before we go higher.

We did see buyers weaken here but we have extreme daily bull momentum to support further upside.

Bulls need to break through three day resistance/ supply at 5562. Bears will look to gap fill us near 5443.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5562 -> 5325  
Demand- 5353 -> 5436

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/t8jzgfte9s7d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdfd163080d80031429d85d616090bd9ff83d3a3

I mentioned on Tuesday that tech was no longer leading this upside and I got some flak for that… while yes individual tickers may move bullishly like NVDA… tech (aka QQQ and NQ) were not bullish… we already had a new supply on QQQ at 485.06 and honestly this supply/ demand could be setting up for a pretty impressive downside move… While we have for now extreme daily bull momentum the buyers on QQQ took an incredibly big drop today… Tuesday we barely held afloat by ES/ SPY… todays dump was because market couldn’t hold any longer without NQ/ QQQ…

Bulls need to bounce off daily 8ema support here and target a closure over 485.06 supply. Bears will look to back test previous demand/ support at 471.93.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 485.06 -> 468.07  
Demand- 450.65 -> 471.93

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

I am finally seeing the reconciliation that we needed on NQ… Tuesday truly left NQ in a very unnatural spot. One of my big hints at open that today could be bloody and actually play out was that we had a massive (relatively) green open on NQ but we had even weaker buyers on the daily than we did on Tuesday. While yes this extreme bull momentum we remain in COULD hold us and negate weaker buyers for one day… it is very improbable to continue even higher than the previous two days when buyer weaken as much as they did.

I too see a potentially major daily reversal here on NQ that should certainly gap fill us down to 19700 but also could take us to daily 20ema support near 19400 area.

Bulls will need to reclaim three day resistance at 20209 to be back in control.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 20209 -> 19700  
Demand- 18594 -> 19592

Overall a pretty good day of trading. I got wicked at BE on an ES short before a bigger drop but overall I had a great day of trading and I am very content.

I failed my previous eval on a longer NQ wick before it hit my TP… was able to reopen a new one and hit that for one day pass today… MFFU still have there nice expert discount so I may pick a few more up over the next few days.  ",1718913862,829070,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,e869063684fdbdb25c88e8bb673c6e68be8faf30e745151d7770957935f85a01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dkl29d/bears_rally_into_quad_witching_day_62024_spy_es/

2111,My insider trading strategy - $10k paper trading ,"I've been developing and testing my insider trading strategy, just opened a Webull paper trading account to test it out on the live market instead of historical back testing. There isn't much information on strategies like this, currently, it's been just trial and error.

My logic behind this strategy:

If a CEO is willing to step up and risk his hard-earned money then I'd be more comfortable risking mine. 

There is a shocking amount of companies where the insiders don’t own any stock, this is a **bad** sign. CEO’s will treat the company like a personal bank account. They’ll issue themselves shares and grant themselves options. They pay themselves excessively and own barely any stock.

These stocks will underperform

I look for companies where the insiders have skin in the game. When the CEO, CFO, Board of Directors have stock that means they have an incentive to work hard. They are shareholders, and just like us, they want to see the price of the stock go up.

This is what I have so far:

1. **A+ Setup**: Top-notch trade with the highest potential.
   * **Type of Insider**: High-ranking executives (e.g., CEO, CFO)
   * **Size of Trade**: Large, significant trades
   * **Trade Type**: Insider purchases (avoiding sells atm) 
   * **Frequency**: Consistent, multiple trades in a short period (I like 10 days)
   * **Timing**: Well-timed around key events (e.g., just before earnings)
   * **Company Performance**: In line with positive market trends or strong fundamentals
   * **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**: 1:3 or higher
2. **A Setup**: Strong trade with great potential.
   * **Type of Insider**: Senior management
   * **Size of Trade**: Substantial trades
   * **Trade Type**: Mostly purchases
   * **Frequency**: Frequent trades
   * **Timing**: Around important company events
   * **Company Performance**: Positive or recovering from a dip
   * **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**: 1:3 or higher

Another key variable is jump in ownership, if one day your portfolio has only 2% of a shady biotech company and then it jumps to 50% i'm going to think u either snorted fairy dust or you know some shit.

in my mind, this strategy is successful if:  

- if the strategy outperforms relevant market benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500).

Beating the benchmark shows that my strategy is adding value beyond what could be achieved with a passive investment.

Playing around with a $10k Paper trading account, if it goes smoothly I'll throw in $10k of real money.

im doing updates a few times a week on my site [notboringdata.com](http://notboringdata.com)

2113,"ZEUS.c Announces Comprehensive 2024 Exploration Plans Beside BIG.v's Major Copper Find, BIG Provides Exploration Update Today","Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for U.S. investors), a junior mining company operating in a promising copper region in Idaho, recently unveiled its exploration plans for the Cuddy Mountain Property for 2024. This site is located near Hercules Silver Corp.’s (Ticker: BIG.v or BADEF for US investors) Hercules Project, which has recently discovered a significant copper porphyry deposit.

For the 2024 exploration efforts, ZEUS plans to conduct an extensive exploration program at Cuddy Mountain, including a 3D-DCIP Induced Polarization (IP) and Resistivity Survey to pinpoint mineralization zones. The exploration program will also include detailed soil sampling, geological mapping, rock grab sampling, and high-resolution ground magnetic surveys to identify prime drilling targets.

Press release: https://www.zeusminingcorp.com/\_resources/news/nr\_20240523.pdf

Cuddy Mountain shares several geological characteristics with BIG's adjacent Hercules Property, including the presence of Olds Ferry terrane rocks, historic silver deposits in rhyolite, the Bayhorse Thrust Fault, and mineral-rich formations beneath younger basalt layers.

BIG's exploration at the Hercules Project has revealed a significant intersection: 185 meters at 0.84% Copper, 111 ppm Molybdenum, and 2.6 g/t Silver, with a notable 45-meter segment at 1.95% Copper. This result underscores the potential of ZEUS’ nearby Cuddy Mountain Property.

BIG's recent discovery has sparked a rush of land claims in the area, with notable stakes made by industry giants Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto, underscoring the region's high potential.

Today, BIG provided an update on its Phase III drill program at the Hercules Property. BIG has cored 3,000 meters across five completed and two ongoing drill holes and assay results are expected in batches by mid-summer. 

Geological findings indicate variable porphyry alteration and mineralization, with assays expected by mid-summer. An inferred fault appears to offset mineralization northwest of the 2023 drilling. Portable spectrometer readings detected advanced argillic alteration, suggesting preservation of high-grade mineralization.

BIG's CEO Chris Paul highlighted the company's evidence of a large mineral system and its strong cash position for continued drilling. The drill program will continue throughout the year, focusing on a multi-kilometer geophysical target area.

Current and prospective ZEUS investors should keep an eye out for BIG's next update, as positive drilling results could reflect positively on ZEUS and its Cuddy Mountain Project.

2119," Renewable Energy Watchlist!: The Big, The Mid, and the Lil’ Guy","And we’re talking about STONKS here baby! Get your mind out of the gutter!

In my recent market endeavors, I’ve taken up interests in the biotech sector with some dabbles of renewable energies on the side, since that seems to be where the trend is heading. But lately the french fries on the side have been far tastier than the red sauce that came with healthy stuff.

But you know I let all ma’ dogs eat. Here’s the menu to Never\_Selling’s Fine Dining.

**First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)**

More of a long-term momentum play with these guys. They have a strong financial track record that exhibits scalable revenue growth year over year at 50% between 2022 and 2023, as well as strong gross profit margins that grew from $69,000 to $1.3M during the same period. More than anything, the sector they reside in has market potential for years to come, that’s the story with them all I guess. Currently trading at $260 a share, so get a small piece of this hog. 

**Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ: RUN)** 

There’s something to like about the leading provider of solar batteries and systems in the U.S. Trading around $12, the company announced on June 4th a record-setting price of $886.3 million senior securitization of its battery and residential systems. A good sign for sure. The transaction closed last week and this will give them the chance for some growth potential in the future.

**Methes Energies International (OTC: MEIL)**

Dessert!  A more recent IPO, but their bio-lubricants are said to replace petroleum-based lubricants in the near future. Think of a lean, green, pumping gasoline! A line of their product has been tested by U.S. military and used in their vehicles, while also having products in retail names like Home Depot and Walmart. The lil’ guy part? Well, they’re trading at $0.02 a share. I guess they’re like a funnel cake for dessert, you get a bunch of pieces for the whole course.

Are any other traders taking a look at this sector and where the market trend is heading? I’m looking at a few more names for later on, but I’m thinking I’ll release they’re double-d’s later on.

2129,"Happy Quad Witching Day… 6-21-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","In the past the quad days had a tendency to be way more volatile than the ones we are currently seeing for the last year… this quad day I believe was one of the largest in value however we just found a tight 15pt ES and 110pt NQ range to chop in for the whole day.

https://preview.redd.it/h6wjh0egez7d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13144103a4e3c982fe0eefcb5674c93602a8f0fb

Data wise we have a pretty mild week in store for us but we do have a decently important day of data on Thursday and Friday.

I do more or less expect the market to continue to recover and look for it to push higher next week. I believe this week was merely a bounce and retest before we push higher.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/io2qffqgez7d1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=671f674afe19273d064eb2471c88d813bc1d64cd

Pretty interesting weekly candle here… this is technically a shooting star BEARISH reversal pattern. We actually had a similar weekly close the week of 12/25/23. If this pattern was to play out we should expect further downside and weakness next week. However, a major difference is that this week did NOT have weaker buyers… with buyer still strong here the favor actually does go to further upside next week.

The bears finally put in a new weekly supply here at 543.11 but as you can see we have a nice imbalanced close here. To rectify this situation we either need to close back under 543.11 weekly supply next week or we need to bounce higher enough to turn supply into demand. Option two is what I will be looking for especially with markets having extreme bull momentum on both the daily and weekly still.

Bulls need to turn supply into demand and look for a breakout and closure over 550. We did finally touch my 550 target but now we need to close over it.

Bears need to minimally close under weekly 8ema support next week and if they do (projected at 534) we could see a bigger drop back to 523.21 supply.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 543.11 -> 523.21  
Demand- 494.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/55sjas0hez7d1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=2957503e0dd3fade7e9a209de8eb7cc65e161aa2

Contract roll week is always a tough one from a TA perspective because it throws off some indicators. For example, right now we should see a weekly supply on Es also but due to the fact that we gapped up for the contract roll it is not showing that supply… we are however showing the same inverse hammer candle here… very well could turn into a weekly retrace for next week if this pattern can play out. However, again we have stronger weekly buyers and weekly extreme bull momentum. The biggest bear case here I see is a major spike in weekly volatility which does sometimes indicate a reversal.

Bulls need to push higher here to close over 5600 which is my new target.

Bears will look to complete the red week and put the new supply in like SPY did this week.. that brings a target of 5400-5420 area.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307  
Demand- 5000

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/99itazahez7d1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=200538a5610fa0061492dc54ab8680608235b1a0

QQQ is very similar to SPY this week because it got a new weekly supply with a classic evening doji star BEARISH reversal pattern. Much like I mentioned above on ES I find this week and likely next week will be important to focus on QQQ/ SPY macro trend over that of ES/ NQ until the market reconciles post contract roll.

On QQQ the most similar pattern to this one is 3/28/22. However, the macro trend was much different.

With us remaining for now in extreme bull momentum on daily and weekly here I do expect further upside. However like I mentioned last week there was a major spike in volatility and that can sometimes lead to a reversal in trend… if this is a topping candle then we could see some heavy downside next week… I believe next week will be decision time…

Bulls need to push higher and target 490 to turn supply into demand and rebalance the market.

Bears will look to rebalance us by closing under 479.37 and targeting a bigger drop down to the weekly 8ema near 465-468 area.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 458.11 -> 479.37  
Demand- 450.77

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/n1u61kmhez7d1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=923215903047fbacf4b568a1eef275a3af78a1c7

Much like on ES the contract roll does throw off the technicals slightly here… however, we did get a weekly supply here on NQ at 19705. As you can see though there Is a major imbalance in the markets due to that though. This major gap is technically an abandoned baby pattern but really unless futures see a major gap down and never sees green after that gap down this is going to just be an ugly pattern until we reconcile in a week or so.

We do remain with stronger weekly buyers and extreme bull momentum on both weekly and daily.

Bulls will look to target a breakout to 20400-20500 to rebalance the market.

Bears need to break back under 19705 and target weekly 8ema support near 19100-19300.

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 18881 -> 19705  
Demand- 18558

I actually had a bit of a rough start to the week, however, I was able to really pull it together this week Thursday and Friday. Its always a mental challenge starting the week in the red. However, I had a great recovery and I was able to have some really great plays today (despite being quad day) to recover all three of my funded accounts to green to close the week out… would I have liked more green?

2136,"Precision M&A Plays Seem Interesting, Looking at $NVCT - Some Research","Hey everyone,

I came across this interesting report on biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and thought I'd share some key points that caught my attention. The focus is on how M&A trends are highlighting the potential of precision medicine, especially in personalized cancer treatments.

**Biotech M&A and Precision Medicine: What's Happening?**

Lately, there's been a big shift among pharmaceutical giants, with companies like Pfizer making significant moves. For example, Pfizer's $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, known for targeted cancer therapies, really underscores the industry's growing focus on precision medicine. This is part of a larger trend where big pharma is recalibrating their strategies to focus more on personalized treatments and targeted interventions.

**Nuvectis Pharma: A Key Player**

One company that stood out in the report is Nuvectis Pharma. Founded in 2020, they're making waves in personalized cancer treatments. They have some promising drug candidates like NXP800 and NXP900, which target specific patient populations in oncology.

* **NXP800** is a small molecule GCN2 kinase activator that's shown promise in preclinical and early clinical trials for ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.
* **NXP900** is a novel SRC/YES1 kinase inhibitor with strong activity in YES1-driven squamous cell cancers and potential in overcoming resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.

Nuvectis has also made strategic partnerships and received FDA Fast Track Designation for NXP800, highlighting its urgency and potential.

**The Bigger Picture**

The precision medicine market is expected to grow significantly, driven by advances in genomics and targeted therapies. This tailored approach to treatment is set to revolutionize healthcare delivery. A great example of this is Immunogen's Elahere, a targeted therapy for ovarian cancer that led to Immunogen's acquisition by AbbVie for about $10.1 billion. This shows the huge potential and value in developing effective precision medicine treatments.

**Why It Matters**

The report makes it clear that precision medicine is a central factor driving the future of biotech. Companies like Nuvectis Pharma are at the forefront of this shift, helping to shape the future of healthcare with innovative, personalized solutions.

Just wanted to share these insights because I found them really compelling. Precision medicine seems to be not just a buzzword, but a real game-changer in the industry.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Cheers!

2137,Actelis Networks - LT Cyber Infrastructure and Hybrid Networking Play? Recent News Creating Momentum (NASDAQ: ASNS),"Wanted to share some news on Actelis Networks (NASDAQ: ASNS) that caught my eye. They’ve just partnered with Carahsoft Technology Corp., a key player in the government IT solutions market. Here’s why it seems to matter:

**Strategic Partnership**  
Carahsoft will now distribute Actelis' hybrid-fiber connectivity solutions to a wide range of U.S. government agencies through their reseller network and government contracts like NASA SEWP V and OMNIA Partners. This partnership is set to enhance government networks with secure, instant connectivity.

**Recent Wins**  
Actelis has been on a roll, recently securing orders to supply networking tech to three U.S. military bases. This marks a significant milestone in their push into the U.S. military sector, proving their growing influence and reliability in providing secure networking solutions for critical infrastructure.

**Meeting IoT and Cybersecurity Needs**  
With IoT devices projected to nearly double by 2030, the demand for secure, efficient networking is skyrocketing. Actelis’ tech boosts existing infrastructure to fiber-grade performance, cutting down on deployment time and costs. This is crucial for modernizing government networks without extensive new installations.

**Cybersecurity Focus**  
As IoT expands, so do cybersecurity threats. Actelis’ solutions are designed to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive data from threats like ransomware and DDoS attacks, aligning with federal initiatives to bolster national cybersecurity.

This collaboration with Carahsoft positions Actelis to support public sector organizations better and tap into the growing demand for secure IoT connectivity.

What do you think about Actelis' moves and the future of IoT in the public sector?

I've been doing cryptocurrency staking for a long time and I can say that this is one of the best and stable methods I have ever seen



I'm not encouraging anyone to repeat after me, just sharing a type of making money from cryptocurrency



I used a capital of $800 and in a day I earned about \~$100 per day



So, the method itself (I'll just copy it from the main source and change it a bit for better understanding)



In short, we get 0.5% when using the IOST network on the MEXC exchange



Steps:



1. Registration on the MEXC exchange

2. Deposit USDT

3. Buy IOST for USDT

4. Go to Wallet > Spot > IOST > Deposit

5. Copy IOST MEMO

6. Step back > Withdraw

7. Fill in the fields as follows:

- Address: coin\_reward

- Network: IOST

- Memo: Copied memo. Important! You must specify each time!

- Amount: Test on small amount (but consider the 0.1IOST commission)

1. Send and wait ±10m

2. Getting the entire amount back, but with an additional 0.5%

3. Repeat everything from step 4



Thus, with each transaction, we increase our capital by 0.5%. It's not a bad method. But it takes a lot of time to work with it

2151, Anybody else seen this AMIX stock?,"Alright by now you guys know that I’m big into the health and technology stuff. Which is why I was able to stumble across yet another diamond in the rough. 

**Autonomix Medical Inc. (NASDAQ: AMIX)** has been leading the way for electrophysiology. 

The medical device company has integrated AI and healthcare to improve nerve-targeted treatment.

They have a microchip that’s like a cruise missile from Call of Duty; you know, like the killstreak. Imagine a chip being controlled by a medical professional to deliver treatments to the precise locations necessary.

This chip is said to have 3000x the sensitivity of any device available now.

This AI integration gives them huge market potential to improve healthcare in many different facets. 

I’ve only just begun my research on these guys, does anybody else know more? Trading around $1.05 a share at the moment and would love input from the fam!

2152,RenovoRx (Nasdaq: RNXT) Revolutionizes Cancer Therapy with TAMP Platform,"RenovoRx, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is pioneering novel precision oncology therapies through its local drug-delivery platform, Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP).

**Highlights from Recent Developments**

Pre-Clinical Studies Publication: The company recently published pre-clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy and innovative drug delivery mechanism of the TAMP platform. This data supports TAMP's potential to transform cancer treatment by delivering chemotherapy directly to solid tumors, minimizing systemic side effects.

Pancreatic Cancer Focus: One of the most promising applications of TAMP is in treating pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Traditional chemotherapy is administered intravenously, leading to widespread side effects. In contrast, TAMP targets the tumor directly, potentially increasing effectiveness and reducing adverse effects.

Expert Insight: Dr. Farsad, an expert in the field, highlights the significance of TAMP, stating, “TAMP has the potential to provide a valuable treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Early studies suggest it can increase local therapeutic tissue concentration independent of traditional methods. We are eagerly awaiting the final outcomes of the ongoing Phase III clinical trial to validate these benefits.”

**Solid Foundation and Potential Growth?**

1. Lead Product Showcases Promising Growth: RenovoGem™, an oncology drug-device combination, delivers targeted chemotherapy using the TAMP technology directly to tumor sites while reducing common side effects. Currently in clinical trials, RenovoGem™ has received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer, offering years of market exclusivity and the potential to be a groundbreaking treatment.
2. Wide Market Landscape: The TAMP platform's ability to reduce systemic exposure while delivering high concentrations of chemotherapy directly to tumors holds promise beyond pancreatic cancer, potentially revolutionizing treatment for various hard-to-treat cancers.
3. Strategic and Experienced Leadership: CEO Shaun R. Bagai, who joined RenovoRx in June 2014, has a proven track record in innovative technological launches for growth companies and large corporations. The leadership team boasts over 200 years of experience in drug development and commercialization, with successful blockbuster drug launches.

2163,"Bears Threaten a Bigger Correction… 6-24-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I hope that everyone enjoyed their weekend! The bears certainly did as they came out with a vengeance today and was able to take the mark much lower. This is starting to set up as more than a simple retrace here. I am very interested to see where we end up at the end of the week. As of right now from a technical point of view we could be looking at a bigger 5-10% correction…

That would take SPY to the 523-500 area and QQQ to the 462-438 area.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/bejohu9dwk8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1f32e4246617508769044d4b0d8904879c83f3

I am showing a bit more zoomed out picture here to show the overall bull channel that we remain in. While short term our bullishness is definitely weakening we are still in a decent amount of bullish long term up trend. If we see a correction similar to 4-1-24 to 4-19-24 then we could be looking at a more mild drop down to 533-536 area before we bounce to a new ATHs.

This is now our third day in a row with weaker daily buyers and we have also officially lost extreme daily bull momentum.

Bulls need to hold support here and can not afford to lose 541.39 demand if they hope to see 548.52 supply before the daily 20ema support is tested.

Bears need to close under 541.39 demand to then target 533.59 demand.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 548.52 -> 536.92  
Demand- 533.59 -> 541.39

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/c8js89mdwk8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba6917e65e0784ee4931354dd69d03f1e1cf6ed

Very similarly here on ES we have officially loss extreme daily bull momentum and we too here have 3 days in a row of weaker daily buyers. The daily 8ema support near 5498 continues to hold here.

Bulls need to bounce off daily 8ema support and target a close over 5539.

Bears will look to close under 5498 daily 8ema support to then target 5436 demand.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5562  
Demand- 5353 -> 5436

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/7ymzxw0ewk8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb8dc9200d02b1af08302da10bef55f47ede17ea

I also am showing that bigger zoomed out view here for you guys on QQQ to show the bullishness long term versus the short term bearishness we are seeing. Just like on SPY if we follow the early April retrace then we realistically are targeting a move down to 450-455 into early July.

On QQQ we are actually seeing daily sellers for the first time since the first week of June and we also loss extreme daily bull momentum here too.

Bulls need to hold 471.93 demand and target a bigger move up to 485.26.

Bears need to close under 471.93 to then target a move to 450.65 demand.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 485.26 -> 468.07 -> 459.82  
Demand- 450.65 -> 471.93

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/0y0k7fgewk8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2f1b7cf0a5a2620454010771b327dc2b42291e5

Nq also is nearing daily sellers and has officially loss extreme daily bull momentum. The S/D indicator is showing a pretty strong downward trend and movement potential here too. We would need a pretty impressive reversal tomorrow to change that indication.

We are finally nearing that 19700 contract roll gap I mentioned that week and I do still see that gap filling before much more upside happens.

Bulls need to hold 19592 demand and support to then recover back to 20214 supply.

Bears need to close under 19592 demand to then target the daily 20ema support near 19410 and daily 50ema support near 18953 supply.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 20214 -> 19700 -> 18953  
Demand- 18594 -> 19592

Looking back at the physical measured volatility was actually extremely high and I honestly probably should have sat cash. We haven’t really had an open like this morning where measured volatility is so high and stays so high in quite a long time. We used to get them quite often in 2023 and I actually used to refuse to trade those days.

I was thankfully able to recover two of my accounts to green and one of them to slightly red. After the volatility nearly caused a very red day for me I decided to take my small wins and small red day and call it a day. Which I am glad I did as we entered quite a bit of chop before we had another sizeable leg down.

Good morning, SqueezeFinders!

We are finally seeing a reasonable pullback after the euphoric rise in $QQQ tech index from mid-May through mid-June. It is very probable that we see the gap I mentioned in yesterday's email get filled tomorrow or sometime this week if sell pressure continues. I'm under the impression that majority of the prior rally was a result of expectations of more rate cuts this year. However, Jerome Powell wasn't content with inflation progress toward the 2% target and had to be a buzz kill with reducing rate cuts from 3 down to 1. Bulls were likely gambling big on the assumption that a significantly cheaper borrowing environment was imminent to increase margin ease of accessibility. Such is life, and although the long-term trend remains bullish, we may endure continued short-term downtrend continuation if bulls decide to pull some gains at these heights. I remain cautiously optimistic, but feel we need to be wary of near-term bleeding. The support levels we need to watch are 473.5, 472, 471.5 before likely filling the gap down to 468 area in the near-term. Now, the resistance levels bulls need to break to return to break the downtrend are 476, 478, 480, 482 to confidently reverse out of this short-term downtrend and resume path to 500+.

2178,The Marquie Group Issues Shareholder Update,"The Marquie Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS:TMGI)



Dear Valued Shareholders - we are pleased to announce the successful completion of an agreement between Ulta Beauty and our subsidiary, Simply Whim for the Whim brand in the health and beauty space. Under the terms of the agreement, we are free to expand our Whim product portfolio beyond our current offerings leading to an expanded product line while sharing the brand with the largest beauty products retailer in the United States. This significant development is the latest in our journey as we complete the transition from a solely broadcasting-focused entity to a dynamic company specializing in consumer-facing, health and beauty product development, sales, and marketing.





Whim has successfully launched several beauty products, with more in the pipeline. However, due to limited access to capital, we have re-prioritized our new product development schedule to focus on VitaWhims, our sugar-free gummy vitamins, and our nootropic functional tea beverages, Sanitea and Insanitea. The development of our AminoMints product has been delayed as we engage a new manufacturer, and we have discontinued the Whim Patch development.



The estimated cost for developing each new product is approximately $50,000, totaling $150,000 for the launch of the three current products in development. Additional capital will be needed to support robust sales and marketing campaigns. Once our revenue model improves, we expect to access more traditional forms of capital, reducing our reliance on company stock.



Our subsidiary, the syndicated radio network Music of Your Life, is attracting more listeners as we introduce our updated music catalog featuring the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC). This upgrade provides an unparalleled listening experience in terms of audio quality for streaming radio networks. All of our Whim products are marketed through radio commercials on the network. Sign-up for free and Listen Live at musicofyourlife.com.



To fund operations and product development, we have negotiated a new equity line agreement with the investment firm MacRab. This arrangement involves the strategic sale of stock based on a Forward-Looking Pricing model. Details can be found in our most recent 10-Q and upcoming 10-K. We will continue leveraging this model until our operations are self-sustaining through generated cash flow.



Our fiscal year ended on May 31, 2024, and our 10-K will be published in August 2024. Highlights include the elimination of an additional $200,000 in debt this fiscal year, totaling approximately $800,000 in debt reduction over the past two years.



Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the new additions to our portfolio of innovative health and beauty products under the Whim and Insanitea brands, scheduled for release in late 2024 to early 2025. We project profitability by 2026, with estimated revenues exceeding $1 million.",1719330624,829141,clootch1,t2_5l4uzyrp,20b5680ea602fc3e41e607eb45cc0367a306ac02e3dac5940574b0d9dcc55549,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1do9a0f/the_marquie_group_issues_shareholder_update/

2186,West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (WRLG.v) Appoints Jason Billan as VP of Corporate Development Today Amid Promising Drill Results and Aggressive Mine Development Plan,"Near-term gold junior West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) is focused on advancing the Madsen Gold Mine and its surrounding 47 km² land package in the Red Lake district of Ontario, a region known for its high-grade gold deposits, having produced over 30 million ounces of gold. Today, WRLG announced the appointment of Jason Billan as Vice President of Corporate Development. Billan brings 15 years of experience in the mining sector, specializing in corporate development, strategy, financing, and executive leadership.

Recent drill results from WRLG's Madsen Mine have been highly promising, revealing high-grade gold over minable widths, suggesting strong potential for future production. Notable recent results from the project's South Austin Zone include:

\- 16.69 g/t Au over 8m

\- 6.17 g/t Au over 17.83m

\- and 7.48 g/t Au over 12m

WRLG is focused on successfully building and operating the Madsen Mine, with no immediate plans for acquisition. The company has set an aggressive development plan, prioritizing key infrastructure and development projects, including extensive underground drilling.

WRLG aims to resume production by mid to late 2025, capitalizing on rising gold prices to enhance the company's value.

WRLG also owns the nearby Rowan Property in Red Lake, which spans 31 km² and includes three past producing gold mines: Rowan, Mount Jamie, and Red Summit.

The Rowan Deposit has an established 1200m strike length and remains open at depth, with high-grade gold zones explored to less than 500m. The NT Zone, extending 2 km and hosting several high-grade gold zones, intersects with the Pipestone Bay St Paul Deformation Zone, presenting a highly prospective exploration target between 1 km and 2 km east of the Rowan Mine Shaft.

Billan holds an MBA from the University of Western Ontario and has previously worked in precious metals equity research at Salman Partners and RBC Capital Markets. His career includes significant roles at Nevsun Resources, Wheaton Precious Metals International, and Gatling Exploration, where he played key roles in financing and advancing mining projects. Shane Williams, President and CEO of WRLG, expressed confidence in Mr. Billan's ability to secure the necessary capital for restarting the Madsen mine and aiding in the company's growth strategy.

2187,Healthcare + Tech Boomer Watchlist!!! $KULR $MEIL $ASTI,"With cautious trading surrounding the market, it’s been awhile since the S&P 500 has gone flying. With that said, there’s a couple of stocks in a health and technology integrated sector that I’m loading up on to make some plays with this week. 

These guys are my keys to posting a green P&L for the close of this month:

* **KULR Technologies (KULR:NYSE)** is kind of nice with it. The company develops advanced thermal management technologies such as carbon fiber-based solutions. The market for thermal-tech is rapidly growing, and their specific innovations give me optimism on their position. On top of that, the company’s revenue is steadily growing along with their profit margin. The signs are aligned for these guys to make a push for years to come. NFA tho.
* **Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (ASTI: NASDAQ**) has been flatlining for a hot minute now; they’re due for a breakout one way or another, right? In my opinion, these guys are looking for a gap and GO this week with their most recent news announcing the company’s debt payoff for outstanding balances. Their financial statements haven’t shown the steam most of us would like to see here, but their true innovators of their field, providing revolutionary portable power systems as well as custom solar solutions for defense systems. Seems promising.
* **Methes Energies International, Ltd. (MEIL: OTC)** is a company looking to change the game of oil and petroleum with a more environmentally friendly alternative in their bio-lubes. A line of their products acts as a gasoline substitute that has been tested out by the US FREAKING ARMY in their TANKS. LARGE MACHINERY. Furthermore, they have a line of products in WALMART AND HOME DEPOT. I just don’t know what else needs to get the stock moving. 

Anybody else have one of these on their watchlist or want to add to it? I think I’ve done some solid research here, but we all know the market is full of surprises.

2192,"GRN Holding Corporation Announces Rebranding to Marijuana Inc. Under the Leadership of the “Henry Ford of the Marijuana Industry,” Donald Steinberg"," GRN Holding Corporation, (OTC: GRNF) is proud to announce its strategic rebranding to Marijuana Inc. (www.marijuanainc.com) to signal a new era of growth and innovation in the global cannabis industry. This transformation is led by the renowned CEO, Donald Steinberg, whose illustrious career in the marijuana sector spans over five decades.





Donald Steinberg: Recognized as the ""Henry Ford of the Marijuana Industry.”



Donald Steinberg, documented in multiple books for his pioneering efforts in the marijuana industry, has a storied history that sets him apart from all others in the field. In the 1980s, Steinberg was recognized by Centac, a U.S. government agency, as the largest importer of marijuana into the United States in the 1970s and the largest U.S. distributor. His unmatched ability to build and scale massive global organizations is showcased in his extensive experience and achievements, which continued in all avenues he has pursued as a disruptive entrepreneur.



A notable moment in his career was featured in an interview with American journalist and talk show host Charlie Rose, who highlighted his significant contributions and insights into the marijuana industry. A “teaser” excerpt of Steinberg’s interview with Rose can be viewed at the following link: https://youtu.be/AgqYZr-fZFc.



Being described as “The Henry Ford of the Marijuana Industry” and the “Inventor of the Marijuana Industry” by investigative journalist James Mills exemplifies the impact Steinberg has made on the marijuana industry. Nearly half of the U.S. now legalizes marijuana for recreational use with even more states decriminalizing marijuana or approving its use for medical purposes. Building this foundation was not without risk. Steinberg, like others, was punished for his highly successful efforts in bringing full freighters of marijuana directly into ports across America for distribution.



Since then, Steinberg has been quiet about his past and has worked to successfully build innovative and disruptive businesses unrelated to marijuana, showcasing his expertise as an honest and intelligent businessman in a multitude of areas. Today, for the first time, he is opening up about his trailblazing past in the marijuana industry of the United States, in order to propel Marijuana Inc. to the forefront of the global market.



Steinberg's Vision for Marijuana Inc.



In the 1990s, Steinberg co-founded One World Communications, one of the world’s largest affiliate marketing companies in the international telecom industry, boasting over 200,000 members across more than 30 countries. His visionary approach continued in 2008 when he co-founded Medical Marijuana Inc., the first company on a U.S. stock exchange dedicated to the marijuana industry.



“As many countries relax their laws on marijuana, I see an opportunity to be involved at the beginning of a new chapter in the marijuana industry. Moving ahead with this idea, I formed Marijuana Inc., took control of an existing public company and merged the two entities to pursue growth opportunities. The name change has been filed and we are awaiting final approval from OTC now,” said Steinberg.



Global Expansion with Legendary Seeds



During this time, Legendary Seeds, a Colombian company formed by Andres Perez and One World Legends, has been at the forefront of producing a wide variety of Landrace strains and well-known hybrids. One World Legends, led by Rocky Petrullo, has supplied Legendary Seeds with the genetics to produce these strains, including Panama Red, Acapulco Gold, Mowie Wowie, and many more. Gaining approval from the Colombian government to export started two years ago, and is now in the final stages, marking a significant milestone in the global marijuana market.

About One World Legends (OWL)



One World Legends has sourced many landrace strains for growing in Colombia. Through OWL’s licensed grow and export partners the company brings a Marijuana World Tour to its customers offering genetics from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Jamaica, Mexico, Colombia, Hawaii, Panama and the United States. Since OWL’s partners grow their cannabis genetics in a laboratory with tissue culture, they can fulfill orders for identical THC products weekly, monthly, yearly, and for decades with the same genetic characteristics. Because the genetics are also landrace strains, the tissue culture process also serves as protection for their genetic collection. They are currently growing tissue culture in Colombia of 17 strains as part of their global launch.

About Legendary Seeds



Marijuana Inc. and One World Legends Inc (OWL) are working with licensed Colombian cultivator Andres Perez in a joint venture. Perez states that after nearly two years of genetics testing, growing, and plant selection he has submitted the first of several planned joint government agronomic evaluations required for export licenses.



“We have successfully culminated our first agronomic evaluation trials (called PEAs) in which we observed and tested 10 different cannabis strains representing a mix of world cannabis genetics, seven of these being psychoactive and three being non-psychoactive (CBD and CBG).

The results of this first trial were exciting as it demonstrated the stability and uniformity of our genetics and their adaptation to the Caribbean environment,” said Perez. “As we expected, Northern Lights, Girl Scout Cookies and Hawaiian Maui performed at peak, leaving us with a great sense of what these strains are capable of. Great bud formation, high trichomes density, intense fruity aroma and bright colors are just a few of the attributes that these strains possess. Likewise, Lemon G, ACDC and Cherry Blossom have nothing to envy to our psychoactive genetics. These strains go far in taste and smell, nothing compared to the hay-like, woody taste of the hemp varieties found around the globe, while hitting under the desired 0.3% of THC. These for sure will have a great impact in helping patients worldwide as smokeable CBD and CBG. We are very excited about our first PEA results, and we are proud to become one of the few companies in Colombia to go this far. This is just the tip of the iceberg.”

2194,"Will Daily 8EMA Support Hold? 6-26-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I do apologize for not getting a TA out last night I was finally able to go pick up my new truck!

We are at a very critical spot in this market right now. The bulls have an opportunity to hold this support and prevent this from becoming a sizeable retrace. However, there is still a technical opportunity for bears here.

https://preview.redd.it/jrho8jgv3z8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae3eb94a2c49b961c364a7e0e5766f675c5538b

Tomorrow is a pretty heavy hitting data day… we have GDP, jobless claims and durable goods at 830am. The bank stress test results at market close is going to be very interesting to watch. And of course we have the presidential debate tomorrow night at 9pm too. While the market is in a bit of a weak spot here it will be interesting to see how the algos react.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/bumey7tv3z8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d45348484d1300483ed33cd8cb825e4bd26986

There is a potential long term about month long bull flag that is forming here… However, the technicals of this two day recovery/ support bounce is very interesting to me. We have not had stronger daily buyer since June 18^(th). Now what I find even more important than the lack of daily buyers for almost a week now is the supply and demand indicator has still not signaled a new demand forming. If tomorrow ends up being red we are likely to see a failed demand and failed recovery put in which is one of the strongest downside indicators that we can get. Arguably June 24^(th) to June 25^(th) was already that…

Bulls need to minimally close over 547 and target a move to 548.52.

Bears will look to close under 541.39 demand to then target the daily 20ema.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 536.92 -> 548.52  
Demand- 533.59 -> 541.39

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/2hu7k34w3z8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af9c5ed92bbc585f29f82957d5f8e83fc6478dcd

I am seeing a pretty similar move here on ES in that we potentially have already put in our failed recovery and with a lack of daily buyers returning for 6 days now we are at a classic bounce or die point here… This daily double top here makes for a very exciting day tomorrow. This daily double top has the potential to confirm our failed daily recovery if we can close under 5514 tomorrow.

Bulls need to breakout over the 5539 resistance to then target a bull flag breakout.

Bears need to close under 5514 to then target daily 20ema support near 5450.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5562  
Demand- 5353 -> 5436

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/3jzivogw3z8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5360fe05f13e37524778fac8909ece5dbf0bd0dd

Now the odd thing about QQQ is that we are seeing stronger daily buyers on QQQ here despite ES, SPY and NQ lacking buyers and also showing downside weakness... We did for the previous two days though see daily sellers and today QQQ is the only one (thanks to the final 10 minute pump) to put a new demand in.

Bulls need close over 485.26 to fully be in control.

Bears have the biggest opportunity here to take this lower from a technical stand point. Bears need to close under 475.88 minimally to then target a move below the daily 20ema support at 471.93 demand area.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 468.07 -> 485.26  
Demand- 471.93 -> 475.88

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/s132g4sw3z8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bdf059777a90f94debfc9b05fc8012e3a9d133f

The failed supply and demand recovery I mentioned on SPY is actually far more apparent here on NQ. I see a pretty similar move here on NQ of course. We are showing the failed recovery/ breakout was already put in two days ago and we are now in the move lower stage. This had the potential to be a nice daily bull flag however this daily double top rejection here appears to be the failed recovery confirmation… especially without a new demand.

We still have my target of 19700 that needs to be filled.

Bears will look to take this down and close under 19747 to then target 19592 demand and daily 20ema support.

Bulls will need to minimally close over 20000 to be in control.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 19700 -> 20214  
Demand- 19592

Today was a bit of a rarity for me in that I had taken three trades and had won on all three trades about 15 minutes into the market open. I generally never play the opening candle due to volatility and misdirections, however, I saw a major ES and NQ potential to go higher so I went ahead and took the risk and it paid off handsomely.

Honestly, I couldn’t be any happier that I was done that earlier as basically the whole day was one major chop zone.

So far a pretty solid start to the week.",1719432605,829217,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,5506dee3240c815d8ac3a6506dd4655323924790444b5f78ba5bea3199c794bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dp88ez/will_daily_8ema_support_hold_62624_spy_es_futures/

(Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for U.S. investors), a junior mining company operating in a promising copper region in Idaho where Hercules Silver Corp. (Ticker: BIG.v or BADEF for US investors) recently made a major copper porphyry at its Hercules Project.

BIG's discovery sparked a staking rush in the area, with notable claims made by industry giants Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto, underscoring the region's high potential.

Major mining investment influencer, Rick Rule, recently praised BIG's copper porphyry find, stating it is looking like ""an absolutely spectacular copper deposit"".

Cuddy Mountain shares several geological characteristics with BIG's adjacent Hercules Property, such as the presence of Olds Ferry terrane rocks, historic silver deposits in rhyolite, the Bayhorse Thrust Fault, and mineral-rich formations beneath younger basalt layers.

ZEUS has extensive exploration planned for its project over the summer. The company is set to do a 3D-DCIP IP survey, detailed soil sampling, geological mapping, rock grab sampling, and high-resolution ground magnetic surveys to identify prime drilling targets.

2205,MEIL on Tank Wheelzzzz,"Come on MEIL, I know you got it in ya buddy.

I am still bullish on Methes Energies International Ltd.’s stock MEIL.

But I'm dogging it out over here with the Bears...

You can’t beat innovation in my opinion, and I’m here to share my final hoorah on this day trader.

MEIL’s bio-lubricants are being used in US MILITARY vehicles. Government contracts, anyone?? For that reason alone I can’t see why they wouldn’t gap up, but I’ve been wrong before and so far the chart is a disaster.

Here’s some quick notes I found in the midst of my second round of MEIL DOUBLE-D.

* **They’re a clean solution to a potent problem.**

Maybe it’s my real-life proximity to the BP Oil Plant, but MEIL gives me optimism that we’re moving into a world where we’re not left cleaning up animals with Dawn Dish Soap (disclaimer: this is not a Dawn Dish Soap promo).

* **Early-on Regulatory Compliance**

Let’s face it, the scrutiny around the petroleum industry is continuing to crescendo; the value of the shares from the oil company your ma and pop invested in 36 years ago aren’t worth what they used to be. When all the top dogs fall, somebody has to take their place on the pedestal. 

* **Overall Market Value**

The industry of bio-lubes in general is growing! They fall under the umbrella of EALs, or environmentally acceptable lubricants, which is set to grow as a sector in ROI by 100% before 2029!

Has anybody else gone long with these guys? One way or another, y’all know my position is no secret - check the user. #AlwaysHodling

$AMZN has been set up for a bullish explosion for a long time now.

A three-year base is more than just something to nod at, however.

Fundamentally, they've been toe-to-toe, and in most cases, the top dog when it comes to customer service in the online retail world.

The world is also turning in the same direction as artificial intelligence - another driver Mr. Bezos has implemented into AWS, they're main revenue driver.

The company is posting significant profit growth, already surpassing last year's final tally of $93B, and Amazon Prime Day is set to launch July 16th and 17th.

To play to the bear, $AMZN is supposed to be going toe-to-toe with Tik Tok shop on a similar campaign during the same week...

...but to the bull, $AMZN isn't facing class-action lawsuits by the U.S. Government like its alleged competitor.

This stock's build up might just be exactly what S&P 500 needs to reignite the market.

Just to refresh your guys memories here is the JPM collar. Now I will say in 2022 and 2023 (especially) the collar became a pretty big deal and everyone focused on it. Into end of 2023 and now in 2024 I have to say the JPM collar is not focused on as much as it used to be. That likely is due to being in a bull market verses a bear market though.

I do expect after we get through the collar roll tomorrow and then the crazy weird week next week due to the holidays we will have some much better training ahead of us.

We are finally starting to see the technicals realign and make sense again here. We have stronger daily buyers for the 2^(nd) day in a row on SPY right now. We also finally put in a new demand that was put in at 543.66 today. The bulls despite the best efforts of the bears have continued to hold the daily 8ema support.

With a new demand, stronger daily buyers and the 8ema support holding I do generally expect us to see a breakout to 548.52 supply.

Bears now need to close under 541.39 and 543.66 double demands to have any sort of control.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 536.92 -> 548.52  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66

ES has now held inside a 47 point chop range for the last 7 trading days. To put this in perspective the average 10 day movement on ES is 48pts. Which means we have seen very little overall range here on ES and a severe lack of direction.

We have yet to see for 7 days in a row now though stronger daily buyers on Es, however, we did finally get a new daily demand at 5533. With this new daily demand/ support here I generally am looking for a move up to 5562 supply. I will say that we need to see daily buyers come in though to support that move higher.

Bears need to minimally close under daily 8ema support near 5518 in order to be back in control.

QQQ may have given us a hint yesterday that we were going to see another bullish day as it was the only one with stronger daily buyers and a new demand. However, we now have the other three following us bullishly now.

On QQQ we once again have stronger daily buyers again and now we continue to ride the daily 8ema support higher. I am generally looking for a higher breakout here to 485.26 supply.

Bears need to hold here and close under daily 8ema support of 478.88 and then demand of 476.05 minimally.

Supply- 485.26

In general NQ has also been trading in a pretty strong chop range for the last 7 days, however, its range has been a little more dramatic at 458 pts which is almost double its 10day average daily range.

On NQ we did have stronger buyers return and did get that matching demand at 19952. With daily 8ema support still holding strong (despite losing it on 6/24/24 briefly) we realistically remain in a bull trend and this still has potential to be a very ugly daily bull flag to go higher.

Bulls now need to target a breakout back to 20214 supply.

Bears are not in control realistically until we close under 19952 demand which is where daily 8ema support should be.

Today was a bit of a rollercoaster for sure. I ended up getting stopped out in two accounts basically back to back and then hit a nice winner in my third account. I was able to long my two loser accounts to get them back to green. I felt pretty solid about my trades and took some and unfortunately took some Ls to put one account back pretty darn red. I was able to fight back and end up with a decent green day.

I did take a new eval and pass that today but did unfortunately lose one in the process too.

Overall this has been a pretty solid week of trading for me and I plan to trade fairly lightly tomorrow.

2214,"Green Energy/Photovoltaic Sector Drives Silver Demand, Summa Silver Corp. (SSVR.v) Announces New Drilling Program at Mogollon Project","According to The Silver Institute's World Silver Survey, demand from the photovoltaic sector is anticipated to rise by 20% this year, making up 23% of the global supply. This surge in demand is occurring alongside a 1% decline in silver production, creating market imbalances.

Source: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FVL/pressreleases/26187406/silvers-bright-future-green-energy-fuels-demand-surge/

Summa Silver Corp. (Ticker: SSVR.v or SSVRF for US traders), a silver exploration company, has announced a new drilling program at its Mogollon Project in New Mexico. 

This initiative aims to explore the Queen vein, which is known for its rich mineral deposits, and to identify significant silver and gold resources over a 2 km stretch.

https://preview.redd.it/rw5skxcde79d1.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=787ca83efd3cf485f40fc32ce9225dc2e3c42a49

The company plans to conduct both infill and step-out drilling to assess the continuity of mineral grades, an essential aspect for future resource estimates. 

One of the primary targets is near the historic Consolidated Mine, where previous drilling has yielded notable results, including 448 g/t silver equivalent over 31 meters and 640 g/t silver equivalent over 9.9 meters.

Further drilling is planned 1.2 km south of the Consolidated target, in areas with high potential. 

The South Queen target has reported 393 g/t silver equivalent over 7.4 meters, while the Eberle target returned 1,133 g/t silver equivalent over 1.65 meters. Both areas remain open for further exploration.

Additionally, the Clifton area, which has not yet been drill-tested, has shown promising historic underground sampling results, with grades up to 382 g/t silver equivalent.

Summa Silver is finalizing detailed plans and budgets for this drilling program, set to begin in the upcoming quarter. The objective is to systematically explore and delineate the mineralized zones, providing crucial data for future resource estimates.

With these plans, Summa Silver aims to advance the Mogollon Project, leveraging its high-grade silver and gold potential to drive future growth and development.

2216,RNXT: the new BioTech Tick2Click,"RenovoRx. Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aims to develop innovative targeted combination therapies designed for difficult-to-treat tumors such as pancreatic cancer. One such development is the company’s staple technology, the Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP) platform. This advanced technology is designed to deliver high concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs directly to the tumor site while ultimately minimizing systemic exposure.

$RNXT is currently trading at $1.16 a share, but the overlapping industries give this stock unwavering potential.

Here's a few reasons why I'm big on this stock....

1. Lead Product Showcases Promising Growth

RenovoGem is an oncology drug-device combination designed to deliver targeted chemotherapy, utilizing RenovoRx’s TAMP Technology, directly to tumor sites while still reducing side effects commonly associated with the treatment. The product is still in clinical trials, but has received FDA Orphan Drug Destination for pancreatic cancer, essentially providing years of market exclusivity and building a runway to be a barrier-breaking form of treatment in the field of oncology

1. Wide Market Landscape

RenovoRx’s TAMP Platform has potential beyond treating pancreatic cancer. The technology’s reduced systemic exposure while delivering direct chemotherapy at high concentrations can revolutionize treatment for a large scope of hard-to-treat cancers.

1. Strategic and Experienced Leadership

Prior to taking over as CEO of RenovoRx in June 2014, Shaun R. Bagai was the Global Market Development Leader at Heartflow, Inc., and has a proven track record for innovative technological launches for growth companies and large corporations alike. Additionally, the rest of the leadership team surrounding $RNXT has over 200 years of experience in drug development and commercialization with proven track records of blockbuster drug launches as well. 

RenovoRx is in position to deliver SIGNIFICANT ROI to investors given the ever-growing market sectors where $RNXT has started to blaze a trail; their current share price just currently comes at a discount.

Does anybody else have a position with a BioTech stock? I’ve had some time to do some thorough DD on this one - with the strong fundamentals, I expect to see a sizable gap in share price over both short and long term periods.

2224,"Get Ready for a Weird Week Ahead… 6-28-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","I will say that in generally these JPM collar days have been pretty darn boring. However todays volatility and overall intraday movement was very impressive and fun to play.

https://preview.redd.it/1rodptukhd9d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dcba2037cc19a7aad929ea59b9b686dd884321f

I believe this chart is a week or so old… but we are nearing the streak of no -2% days that was established in 2018. The most impressive streak was that one of 2003 to 2008 which we all know how that ended…

https://preview.redd.it/wxo0648lhd9d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8014abd35b65ed59aa1ec4f4b2e35162590796a0

First off I will ONLY be trading Monday and Tuesday next week. I will be headed out of town on Wednesday and not back till Sunday so no weekly TA next week…

Now lets talk about how WEIRD and untradeable next week is going to be… Tuesday we have JPOW speaking at 930am and Jolts at 10am… gonna be a big market moving day.

Wednesday we have a HALF day of trading… we close the market at 1pm. Whats really weird is that we get FOMC minutes at 2pm when the market is CLOSED.

Thursday the market is closed.

Friday the market will re-open and we get unemployment rate. This is also going to be a highly volatile and market moving data piece. I would get ready for some weird movement and weird after hours movement next week.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/0zxs1mklhd9d1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9af571d0943aab0a6343eb4e9f118ca92110af1

Quite the interesting way to end the week here… I woulda expected a bigger breakout and while my target was a breakout over 5561/ 20214 on ES and NQ I am a bit surprised we got such a major rejection here.

Last week we had put in a new supply and also an imbalanced close. Up until the EOD flush we were set to turn supply into demand and rebalance the market. However, we are now left with no new demand and weaker weekly sellers.

This actually plays out a really nice weekly double top rejection. With back to back weekly dojis and now the weekly double top you have got to start being concerned if you are bullish here. Now market still remains unbalanced here… we either need to see bulls close over likely 550 and turn supply into demand to balance this or we need to see bears take this minimally under 542.91 but ideally under 540 to take some control. As you can see we have our yellow bull channel but we also have an impressive red rising wedge that if it breaks could be pretty impressive to the downside…

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.21 -> 542.91  
Demand- 494.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/5ifuyfvlhd9d1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b2957340afd66211a1ad0ea4722e367fe4404c

Now due to the contract roll and gap up last week ES did not get a new supply nor did it get the imbalanced close we saw on SPY. Therefore we still since our demand was put in at 5000 have not put in a single new level. A 588 point move after a demand or supply is put in on ES is actually an incredibly large move. Last weeks shooting star did not quite play out however we once again are closing out an indecision and a lack of continuation candle here on ES.

Much like SPY we were looking for a more indecisive close here rather than a strong weekly double top doji rejection here. This double doji rejection certainly has potential for bears to take over control minimally next week but perhaps for the whole month of July.

Bulls need to minimally get through 5536 at close but ideally close in the 5600 area to be back in control fully.

Bears have their work cut out for them but need to minimally take this under 5500 which would put in a new supply and likely start a leg down to the weekly 8ema support near the low 5400s.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307  
Demand-5000

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/v6yx5v7mhd9d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=701c0fefc1f66e344d290d0621997e8eae6a84bb

We saw a pretty impressive amount of divergence from SPY/ QQQ and ES/ NQ this week. However, we ended up closing out a pretty similar weekly move here which is that of a rejection. One thing I had mentioned was the fact that tech was not leading the rally last week and this week I would say up until today they were leading the upside move.

On QQQ last week we also got a new supply and an imbalanced close. Up until the EOD flush we were set to balance the market by turning supply into demand. However, in a pretty incredibly bearish move we closed just low enough to rebalance the market but closing under previous supply at 479.37. Now this is where things get pretty interesting in my opinion. We have a pretty solid bearish triple top now at 479.37 with a weekly supply and a weakening of weekly buyers. This certainly opens up an opportunity for bears to seek out the bottom of this weekly channel support near 470.5-471 which also would be weekly 8ema support. However, bulls could find a bounce here while they still remain in extreme bull momentum to push through this triple top. Bulls minimally need to close over 479.37 supply but ideally closer to 490 in order to be in control again.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 458.11 -> 479.37  
Demand- 450.77

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/3b5zjzlmhd9d1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cb2a5cc150b6e06684095e4cc9a7dec6a3564a9

Due to the bigger gap up that NQ experiences on contract roll we have a slightly different move here in the market but in the end this is the same bearish rejection. Last week with the contract roll we did get an imbalanced close with our weekly supply at 19705 being well under close.

We had for a momentum attempted to turn that supply into demand to balance the market but in the end we were not able to do it thanks to the flush at EOD. We now have a solid weekly double doji rejection here with a double top. This opens up a major opportunity for the bears next week with no stronger buyers this week.

Bulls need to fight through this 20005 weekly double top resistance and ideally close near 20300+ in order to be back in control and to rebalance the market by putting a new demand in.

Bears need to seek out (and I generally expect them to) a retest of 19705 supply and ideally close under it next week.

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 18881 -> 19705  
Demand- 18558

I once again had a rough start to the week but was able to turn it around to finish the week out incredibly strong and honestly put in a great week of trading! Absolutely no complaints. I am a bit surprised todays quarterly options expiration gave us such a tradeable movement but I am glad it did.

I have a strong feeling that Monday and Tuesday will be pretty solid trading (Tuesday may be a wash with JPOW speaking at 930 and JOLTS at 10am though)… I will be gone Wednesday through Friday out of town for the 4^(th) of July seeing family. I will certainly not be doing any trading and I honestly think Wednesday will be a complete was of a day trading (think lowest range and volume of the year) and then Friday is going to be so volatile with all the data from Wednesday and Friday morning that its gonna be tough to trade well…",1719606722,829231,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,d384db150358e02bd122a464475232153631df2ba90e471e4d2fe9f0c7a39faf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dqti2o/get_ready_for_a_weird_week_ahead_62824_spy_es/

2226,A Month's Worth of Notes to Set Up Your Next $TSLA Trade,"Hello Reddit Traders...

I specialize in long-term options trading and swinging equities - these specialties always brings me back to our good friend Elon at Tesla.

Before we load our next big long-term option on $TSLA, we're waiting for a confirmed break over our identified level of $204.

That said, we added 50 shares at $160 and $180.

$160 -> $198.71 **+24% | +$38.71**  
$180 -> $198.71 **10%** |**+$18.71**

A famous Redditor by the name of JeffAmazon once said, ""knowledge sharing benefits all retail investors in the stock market.""

So with that, I leave you all with our YTD notes of both the fundamentals and TA for the inevitable set up for our beloved Elon Stonk, $TSLA.

Always open to feedback :) and stay tuned as we approach that $204 level!

 *6/24/24 Idealism of the Future We are gaining strength. They are poised to reveal their robotaxi on August 8th. What else might they reveal? FSD has never been so close to becoming commercially scalable. We are seeing money rotate slightly out of the Mag 7 names into big growth names. Firesales on major names like this are hard to find. Our price targets remain the same.* ***Over $180, we look to target $200. Over $204, $266 to $300+.***   
  
*3/19 We added at $162 (+7%). I’m looking at $160.59 to become a stable range bottom, but will buy down to our long-term trendline support. I am loading up on equities. Time for options has yet to arrive until the trend has reversed. We need to clear $182.78 first, then $203 (historically around 25 days).* ***Once cleared, our big options trade will target $267.*** *We do need to break descending trendline resistance on the weekly, so this will likely take several months. End of our wedge sits around November 2024.*

2240,"Bulls Prevent a Major Drop… 7-1-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","On Friday I was generally expecting this to be a VERY weird week of trading with the shortened week and the big economic data we will be getting. I honestly expected today to be the most “normal” day of trading however, this was a real nice bear trap of a day… I am genuinely impressed by the V bottom and bullish recovery we did… we were looking after opening hour at a major bearish day from a technical stand point. However, the powers be took the VIX down majorily today and saved the day. While volume remains low (barely around 60-65% of the 30day average) the big money is clearly using the VIX to drive this market right now.

If you were looking forward to tomorrow being a better day of trading… well JPOW is scheduled to speak at 930am and then we will get a major economic data point of JOLTS at 10am… This will be very interesting to watch play out… tomorrow could be a VERY good day to just sit cash…

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/ma4vozg3sy9d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fd02f2be9ae123c342f27cfb8921f8f777d0ba7

Here on the daily we once again have a MAJOR phenomenon and oddity from a technical versus price action stand point. On Friday we put in a new supply at 546.46 which gives us a clear low here close on the daily and a new resistance area. We as I mentioned officially lost daily extreme bull momentum and Friday and today both had WEAKER daily buyers. However, despite the weakness we actually held bullish today. I wouldn’t have expected the V bottom recovery we got today based on the technicals.

Now from a price action stand point you can see we have held this 543.66 demand very well along with the daily 8ema support. We did not get a new daily demand today so the favor actually still goes to the downside. However, we may need to see actual daily buyers before we push lower.

Right now we have a pretty clear range… Resistance is 546.46 to 548.52 and support is 541.39 to 543.66.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 546.46 -> 548.52  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66

Looking at ES I would say we have the same oddity of price action here too. We do not have stronger daily buyers here on ES either and we of course loss daily extreme bull momentum. From a technical stand point I cant really justify a bullish move here… however, again from a price action stand point this 5533 demand is a magnet and we have a strong support holding us up at 5516.

Realistically our range here is 5516 to 5533 for support and resistance is 5550-5562. Just chop in between.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562  
Demand- 5436 -> 5533

**QQQ DAILY**

I think its important to note that we have a pretty large divergence between SPY/ QQQ and ES/ NQ right now… Now taking a look at QQQ I can say we have the same odd price action where technicals and price action are not quite agreeing. I would have honestly from both a price action and a technical stand point have expected that to take us much lower today in general. However, this is another case where the last 5 minutes of trading changed the narrative. We had stronger daily buyers come in during the final 5 minutes And a new demand… the rest of the day was less than ideal for bulls in my opinion.

Here on QQQ we have a bit wider but a more clear range here with resistance at 481.59 to 485.26 and support at 476.05 to 479.05. Truly I don’t think we have a sense of direction until we CLOSE over 485.26 or under 476.05.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 485.26  
Demand- 471.93 -> 476.05 -> 479.05

NQ is another one that honestly diverged from the masses today. All day long (well mid day on) we had stronger daily buyers on NQ but we had no new demand until the final 5minutes when we got that big push. We also had a major rejection on Friday with a double top off previous strong supply with a new supply/ resistance put in. It was interesting to then see a major double bottom with a new demand today…

Our range here on NQ is resistance at 20068 to 20214 and support at 19952 to 19967. Realistically though our bigger range is 19952 and 20214. I would be careful on a longer term direction till we close over one of those.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 19700 -> 20068 -> 20214  
Demand- 19592 -> 19952 -> 19967

Today was a GREAT day for two of my accounts and I will be getting a payout tonight which is even great. Honestly I was green in all three accounts and knew I had a payout secured and knew I have 4 backup accounts for MFFU and decided to be a little aggressive and well it didn’t play out. However, I honestly would have taken the last three trades again… I was looking for a rejection and honestly like I mentioned above from a technical stand point and even price action we had numerous rejections that just failed to break down.

All in all a good day. This is also why I like to trade 3 accounts separately as it allows me to spread my risk around. I knew when I was taking my trades that I had already secured a payout, and two of my three accounts were sitting real nicely (2^(nd) account likely also gets paid this week… well next since im only trading tomorrow). But this allowed me to knowing I had 4 backup and passed evals to be able to have a little fun and be a little more aggressive with low risk involved.",1719864500,829291,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,9ee900fd976f92f9696f03cebf25bf1c50246b78060b960bced6be2c65397f46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dt2o4f/bulls_prevent_a_major_drop_7124_spy_es_futures/

2245,Quantum computing is a new opportunity in 2024: Nvidia / WiMi is starting a new round of tech development,"In 2024, with the birth of a large-scale cluster of quantum cloud computing power and the birth of 500 + bit superconducting quantum computing chips, quantum computing has successively become a hot topic.



**Quantum computing has become a mainstream investment theme**

More notably, strategic investor interest in quantum computing has increased significantly, with more than $2 billion being invested, and Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) have been active strategic investors in the past three years.

On June 26, Microsoft said publicly that the company’s vision is to empower scientists through new AI technologies to unleash their creative potential and address some of the most pressing challenges. To realize this vision, we need to combine generative AI technology with quantum computing to enhance every stage of the scientific approach.

Meanwhile, on June 27, Nvidia (NVDA) held its fiscal year 2024 shareholder meeting. As for the development prospects of quantum computing mentioned by some shareholders, Huang said that the future of computing algorithms will be to accelerate the combination of computing and quantum computing. Nvidia will not build quantum computers, but is working with the entire ecosystem to build all the platforms needed for quantum computing.



**Quantum technology is changing rapidly**

For example, quantum information computing technology is one of the important directions for cultivating future industries, building new quality productive forces and promoting high-quality development. It attracts a number of giants to gather together and is expected to lead a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation.

Tracing back to the late 1980s, scientists applied quantum mechanics to the field of information, quantum information technology was born, and attracted the attention of the superiority and development potential of classical information technology, which was called the “second quantum revolution”.

Among them, quantum computing is a branch of the three basic characteristics of quantum superposition, quantum entanglement and coherence; quantum communication mainly uses the characteristics of quantum entanglement, involving quantum cryptographic communication, quantum remote transmission and quantum intensive coding; quantum precision measurement is one of the foundations of quantum information technology application, involving the observation of quantum physical state and its information carried.

Now, after more than 40 years of development, quantum computing technology has from only academia basic scientific research and cutting-edge technology exploration, gradually into the industry participation of engineering application research and future industry in the process of history, gradually into the technology research, engineering research and development, application exploration and industry integration to promote the key stage of development.

Industry insiders believe that the powerful computing power of quantum computing will bring disruptive changes to the human society, will promote the development of quantum communication, quantum sensing and other related fields, and form a complete quantum information technology system. Quantum-based computing technology has natural advantages in dealing with big data, complex computing and other issues, and will promote a new round of scientific and technological revolution to make breakthroughs in more fields.

 

W**iMi seized the opportunity**

There is no doubt that quantum computing technology frequently appears in the discussions of investors, and it has become a cutting-edge technology field that attracts much attention after artificial intelligence. It is understood that, as a start-up company in the field of quantum computing, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) quantum computing technology is developing rapidly. Pay close attention to the long-term development trend, accelerate the progress of product development, fully grasp and understand the good opportunity in this field, and fully prepare for the possible investment opportunities in the future.

Up to now, WiMi’s Microawareness Quantum Science Research Center has established a deep alliance with domestic top universities and research institutions on the basis of mutual trust. Through joint research and development projects, WiMi integrates the resource advantages of both sides to jointly overcome major scientific problems in the field of quantum science. In addition, by sharing scientific research resources, the development status of quantum technology and its potential impact on the technology market are analyzed, which provides technical theoretical support for practitioners and investors.

In the context of increasingly fierce global competition in science and technology, continuous breakthroughs in the field of quantum computing will inject strong impetus into scientific and technological innovation and economic development. In this regard, in the field of quantum computing, WiMi has also conducted research on AI, semiconductor, optics and other technology routes, and has made important breakthroughs. This provides a strong guarantee for it to occupy the commanding heights of science and technology in the field of quantum computing in the future and maintain the core competitive advantage of the enterprise.

 

T**o sum up**

The long history has long proved that the power of technology, like a constant spring tide, always pushes the world forward. In this science and technology competition, all enterprises should continue to grasp the general trend, play a good ‘first hand chess’, give full play to the leading role of scientific and technological innovation, industrial control and safety support, gather strength to make original and leading scientific and technological breakthroughs, and contribute to the construction of a more harmonious world.

2251,University of Nebraska Medical Center Launches Patient Enrollment for RenovoRx’s ($RNXT) Pivotal Phase III,"RenovoRx, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is pioneering novel precision oncology therapies through its local drug-delivery platform, Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP).

**Highlights from Recent Developments**

Pre-Clinical Studies Publication: The company recently published pre-clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy and innovative drug delivery mechanism of the TAMP platform. This data supports TAMP's potential to transform cancer treatment by delivering chemotherapy directly to solid tumors, minimizing systemic side effects.

Pancreatic Cancer Focus: One of the most promising applications of TAMP is in treating pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Traditional chemotherapy is administered intravenously, leading to widespread side effects. In contrast, TAMP targets the tumor directly, potentially increasing effectiveness and reducing adverse effects.

Expert Insight: Dr. Farsad, an expert in the field, highlights the significance of TAMP, stating, “TAMP has the potential to provide a valuable treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Early studies suggest it can increase local therapeutic tissue concentration independent of traditional methods. We are eagerly awaiting the final outcomes of the ongoing Phase III clinical trial to validate these benefits.”

2262,Conviction on the Position: Why $U Should go Long with Unity Software too,"See what I did there? ;)

I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little butthurt by Cramer calling this software stock “a falling knife…”

C’mon, Cramer! You’re supposed to be my guy!

If you’ve been long with **Unity Software ($U)** for a while now, I’m sorry about the hit its taken on your portfolio YTD.

However, I come to give the trading community of Reddit some reassurance as to why there’s still upside to be had with these guys - and this is the most ideal time to buy.

**Unity Software Inc.** is most-known for their software products that provide real-time 3D content to video game developers.

Their technology, the Unity Engine, is spread across various product/subscription options offered by the company, and is responsible for the development of popular games such as Among Us, Subnautica, Rust, Cuphead, and free or cheap-to-play games.

Their most notable products are known as Unity Pro (for professional game developers), Unity Plus (for indie games), Unity Ads (for monetization of your web service) and more. These products span further than the video-game industry, garnering their artificial intelligence development within the automotive, film, and engineering industries as well.

What’s unique is Unity Software’s business model - the business is split into **Operate Solutions**, which is responsible for their ad revenue, in-app purchases and other tools, **Create Solutions** (where revenue is driven from the Unity Engine), and **Strategic Partnerships**.

Over the last two years, the Create Solutions segment has been the largest source of income to the revenue figure. However, the growth rate of that revenue figure is crashing…

25.23% growth from 2021 to 2022, 15.11% from 2022 to 2023, and a 32% decrease from their year-open share price of $38.79/share are all terrible nods from the fundamental section.

Furthermore, Unity’s EBITDA and free cash flow have seen significant increases over the course of 2024 as well.

But a popular AI/Software stock researcher and I still speculate this is a “buy the dip” opportunity.

A primary speculative reason for the fall of $U is the raised subscription service cost. Developers who use Unity Software to develop and distribute their games have to pay a subscription fee for the distribution and development.

Towards the end of 2023, interim CEO Jim Whitehurst raised the subscription fee on the developers using their engine to make gains, ultimately driving a short spurt to the revenue figure.

Although it did give a boost to the total, this added charge pissed off a LOT of developers, causing $U to fall all the way down to where we are today - a mere $16/share, after Unity reported an EPS of -$1.83 for their shareholders in 2023.

All of that said, the bad man is now gone everybody…

Tomorrow, 7/3, Matt Bromberg will take the reins of Unity Software Inc. as the newly appointed president and CEO.

Bromberg brings over 20 years of service in the gaming industry as he is formerly the COO of Zynga, and had other leadership positions before this with Electronic Arts.

Before both of these ventures, Bromberg served as the President and CEO of Major League Gaming, where he played a monster role in the esports revolution.

While running the show at Unity, Bromberg will continue to hold his positions at Monzo, Blast, and Fitbit, which are all tech companies spanning across various market sectors.

Bromberg has a heart for the gamer, not to mention, their developers - and its alleged his plan is to lower the fee on their subscription service to open the gates to the next “Among Us” developer.

I personally think “the falling knife” was caused by lack of customer appreciation from leadership; a change in leadership could be the spark $U needs to light a fire on the bottom wick of the stick ;)

Analysts are projecting a $0.13 EPS for their Q2 earnings call - a decrease from the previous years projection of $0.17. Unity Software hasn’t missed projections on this front for some time, and have even turned in an average 56% surprise factor since Q2 of last year.

Although analysts are projecting a +20% growth in their revenue year-over-year, what will be most interesting to see is if Unity will be able to turn around their plummeting profit margins by the end of the year.

I added shares to my position with $U today, with the change in leadership set to go tomorrow, this might be the last time to “buy the dip,” and when the next hit mobile game comes out, I’m hoping to have a little “told-you-so” moment in the back pocket.

It’s speculation, but it's optimistic.

Let me know if you guys have a position, long or short, with $U 2! (See what I did there again ☺️)

Hope you got something valuable here \~ always NFA

2263,Pioneering Indigenous Economic Empowerment: Nations Royalty Corp. (NRC.v)," Nations Royalty Corp. (Ticker: NRC.V) is an innovative Indigenous Royalty Company established to provide exposure to royalties derived from Benefit Agreements with First Nations, with an initial focus on the Nisga’a Nation.

NRC's partnership with Nisga'a marks the beginning of a broader mission as NRC is in discussions with other First Nations, aiming to expand its impact. The company seeks to drive economic independence for Indigenous communities by managing significant assets and reducing their reliance on government transfer payments.

The ambition behind NRC is supported by a robust management team with deep expertise in natural resources, Indigenous engagement, and Benefit Agreement negotiations. 

A key figure in this venture is prolific inventor and figure in the mining space, Frank Giustra, who started Wheaton River, which later became Wheaton Precious Metals, a pioneer in the metals streaming business.

Giustra’s belief in NRC’s potential is evident in his statement: ""I believe that Nations Royalty will be as impactful in the mining and royalty space as when we founded Wheaton Precious Metals and introduced the concept of Metals Streaming in 2004.""

NRC distinguishes itself through its pioneering position in the Indigenous royalty space. By capitalizing on the historical leadership and innovative spirit of the Nisga’a Nation, NRC offers a unique investment opportunity in a previously untapped market segment.

The company’s strategy involves acquiring additional royalties, both in Canada and globally, presenting significant growth potential for investors while facilitating the economic empowerment of Indigenous communities.

This approach allows First Nations to unlock the value of their royalties, often stemming from Benefit Agreements, while retaining the Net Asset Value (NAV) multiples typically afforded to established royalty companies like Wheaton Precious Metals and Franco-Nevada.

For First Nations, joining their royalties into NRC offers several compelling benefits. Aggregating their royalties strengthens their balance sheets and enhances economic independence. The company’s value is notably underpinned by five Nisga’a Benefit Agreement Royalties, valued at $214 million, which brings financial credibility and the potential for dividend payments to shareholders.

https://preview.redd.it/hittoszvh6ad1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0db09d6a5787a485fdf7f8a956cdffaf535891

Additionally, NRC provides a platform for Indigenous communities to unite and diversify their exposure to various royalty projects across Canada, fostering collective economic advancement.

NRC’s innovative model contrasts traditional royalty structures by reducing risk for First Nations. If a single project experiences difficulties, the royalties from multiple projects across Canada and potentially worldwide offer a diversified income stream.

This diversification mitigates the risks associated with individual project hiccups, natural disasters, or the end of a mine’s life, ensuring more stable and consistent royalty payments.

Additionally, the company appeals to both natural resource and ESG-focused investors by offering exposure to the rapid growth potential of the last untapped royalty space. 

As there are over 150 Benefit Agreements for mining operations across Canada and NRC has a vision to add many more First Nations as long-term shareholders. With this, NRC may be able to pay dividends to shareholders in the near future.

TMAS has also invested in and applies advanced processing and patented leaching technologies, aiming to reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of metal extraction while maximizing efficiency.

Yesterday, TMAS announced the appointment of David Caldwell to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. This strategic move aims to leverage Caldwell's extensive experience in the global mining sector to advance Temas' projects.

David Caldwell brings over 35 years of mining expertise, with a robust background in project development, feasibility studies, permitting, and asset build-out. 

He recently served as Co-Founder, Director, and Chief Innovation and Sustainability Officer at Pinnacle Iron and Steel/Trinidad Tobago Iron Steel Co. During his tenure, Caldwell led ESG initiatives, innovated methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and explored waste transformation into revenue streams.

His work in metallurgical optimizations for vanadium, titanium, and iron feedstocks to recover valuable metals and chemical products further highlights his proficiency.

Prior to his role at Pinnacle, Caldwell spent over 14 years with BlackRock Metals as Co-Founder, Director, and VP Technical Services. 

He was instrumental in identifying the potential of Quebec’s Lac Doré layered complex, culminating in a full feasibility study for a $1.3 billion construction project.

This project boasted the best vanadium grades in North America, along with excellent titanium and high-purity iron credits.

2279,"Why I think MAXN is going to go up, and why I think it's happening really soon.","Not financial advice, just my opinion, also has been really heavily discussed on Reddit recently.

It's a well established company that had a drop in revenue due to multiple reasons, largely the resolved dispute with its former main customer Sunpower.

The share prices dropped as a result of a share dilution announcement through its main shareholder TCL Zhonghuan buying $100m in stock and $97.5m dilute to get more liquidity for the company, a class action lawsuit alleging that investors weren't made fully aware of how much Sunpower was part of their revenue and heavy shorting (it's like 60% shorted right now with 600+% short interest). In fact the float is 30m and it had a 202.5m trading volume just earlier for the day.

Perhaps it isn't worth the $1 per share right now that it fell from a few days ago, but imo it shouldn't be this low at 17-18 cents each. Shorts have to cover eventually and retail might find it attractive enough to enter at this low price point and frankly, which has a good chance of triggering a squeeze back up to something that isn't artificially shorted down by hedge funds. 

In fact I think all it takes to shoot back up is a single hedge fund going bullish on the stock, combined with shorts covering and retail buying.

I'm willing to take the risk of the stock dropping further and gamble on it because I think the company is worth more than this. In fact just $5m would lock up the entire 30m float. It might even be linked to RK's fire emoji before the GME explosion lol.

After all, would an investor like TCL Zhonghuan invest $197.5m to help tide MAXN over if they really thought it's worth just $0.15-0.20 for a total market cap of just... 9.5m?

2302,"Market Prepares for JPOW… 7-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","After taking a little break last week from trading to enjoy the 4^(th) of July and see some family… it appears the market did not take a break and instead had its own fireworks as its gone on an impressive four day pumps through new ATHs on ES and Nq…

https://preview.redd.it/qgiauxo5qcbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=398aee4a8b1116df7aeed7606dd96cbab1423a00

If you thought this week was going to be better… well just take a look at this calendar here… we have two days of JPOW testifying (usually form 10am till about 1pm), we also have Yellen yapping at 10am tomorrow too and then Thursday we will get CPI… this is going to be a very volatile week.

https://preview.redd.it/a08ivpy6qcbd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8b5770a8ad76c4bb871a4d40ed7f32f1677713

It is pretty much a given in now a days in this regarded market that any time we have data or a fed speaker (especially JPOW) the highest probability move is that market will find the smallest sliver of bullish copium and rip all day.

Over the last almost 3 years only two of the 5 times JPOW has testified has the two day move resulted in a bearish move.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/dr4dmtz6qcbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4fc628ce1dd9732c8db72fd7b52ea8da678ebe

Impressively we are almost back into daily extreme bull momentum now. Which I suppose shouldn’t be too surprising as we have gone on a pretty impressive three day run leading into today.

Bulls are now back in price discovery mode once again here. The buyers were just barely able to weaken today on SPY though. However, despite the weakness today we did not end up with a new supply. This doji here actually gives way for either type of move tomorrow.

In general I still think a retest of the daily 8ema is plausible which takes us back to 551-552 area. However, we are realistically long term bullish until we close and hold under the triple demand/ support from 541.39-545.23.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/s61tirb7qcbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=327a78d238c33bd919855b571e713c0a31ade765

We do have a slight difference here on ES and SPY… despite the fact that we are also re-entering extreme bull momentum here we are not seeing weaker daily buyers today. However, this potential shooting star candle tomorrow could once again lead to a retrace lower tomorrow. However, quite often when we get these days we tend to see bulls buy the dip anyways. Realistically, the bulls just buy up every technical pattern lately.

Again I expect daily 8ema support could be retested near 5580, however, I would not be long term bearish till we closed under 5532 demand/ support.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562  
Demand- 5532

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/tpta0dn7qcbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=988b1b587bd1a40e9f7a95b11e7f63e03d2bb6b2

I am generally impressed with the tiny range we saw on QQQ/ NQ today… we barely hit 36% of the 10 day average daily range with 30 minutes left. We had some very impressive divergence on ES and NQ today too which was interesting to watch. Today very much so seemed like the algos used one to pin the other and vice versa. There was very few times when the algos moved both SPY/ QQQ together in congruence today.

On QQQ we continue to see stronger daily buyers and we are officially back in extreme daily bull momentum. We of course did not get a new daily supply today.

Realistically bulls can push into the 500+ area tomorrow. However, I again think the daily 8ema support near 490 is most probable to be retested first.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 485.26  
Demand- 471.93 -> 476.05 -> 479.05

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/uwh0zoy7qcbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=271d8aa18395bf81ec60282d62e2f9fd7020184c

Today NQ came up and touched a pretty impressive resistance line that dates back to September 2023. This is of course the almost year long bullish channel that the market has been in. We had a very nice touch and rejection off that and new ATHs today.

Similarly here we once again have stronger daily buyers and are back in extreme daily bull momentum. There is no new supply yet so it is a bit difficult to justify a true bearish bias.

I am generally still sticking to the theory of a daily 8ema retest near 20350-20400 before we can see a sustainable upside move (especially after 4 days of straight bullishness). However, I again would not be long term bearish until we closed under double demand support of 19952-19967.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 20068 -> 20214  
Demand- 19952 -> 19967

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I was hoping after the last two weeks of choppy trading that we would see a bit of an improvement today and well I was sadly mistaken. I got blasted pretty good early morning in the incredible volatility on NQ (despite the smaller range) and even more port wrecking was the incredibly divergence on ES and NQ… I truly just couldn’t get on the right side of any trade this morning.

It did unfortunately cost me a funded account today. I continue to have three backup funded so that account will be replaced today. I was able to get both my other funded accounts back to green by EOD thankfully (that is the two lowest accounts shown that are MFFUSFST and MFFUSFEX). I did end up opening a new eval today which is the top account MFFUEVEX and hope to continue working on that tomorrow.

Not quite the best way to start my week and with the volatility and heavy hitting data coming the rest of the week I plan to tread lightly this week.",1720469195,829456,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,df16a6c6e4208dc0cafa210d042549f73c722f73a90d2a564370d4d65acf866e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dyimts/market_prepares_for_jpow_7824_spy_es_futures_and/

2305,Bullish on Copper - Here's Why CLLXF Stands Out,"**Hello and happy Monday everyone.** Sorry for the slow posts recently, I’ve been moving cross-country and taking the scenic route! Today, I’m diving into a top copper pick for the next few days - $CLLXF (Callinex).

**But first, let’s take a look at copper demand, specifically for CLLXF!**

1. **Copper Demand:**

* Copper demand is projected to increase by 46% by 2031, driven by the energy transition and broader industrial use. Specifically, excluding China, copper demand is expected to accelerate.
   * McKinsey estimates that global copper demand will reach 36.6 million tonnes (40.3 million tons) by 2031, up from 25 million tonnes (27.6 million tons) in 2023.
   * However, the supply by 2031 is predicted to be only 30.1 million tonnes (33.2 million tons), indicating a significant shortfall. Therefore, maintaining copper supply is essential for decarbonization efforts.
* Government policies promoting global electrification are creating a sustained new demand for copper while making its supply more challenging due to ESG requirements imposed on new mining operations.
* Electric Vehicles (EVs), leading the electrification movement, account for 55% of copper demand and use 2.5 times more copper than an average internal combustion engine car.
   * The average home uses over 400 lbs of copper, an internal combustion car uses 66 lbs, and an average EV uses 150 lbs.

1. **How to Gain Exposure?** Investing in copper mining and exploration stocks provides indirect exposure to copper prices. These stocks are typically leveraged plays on copper prices due to the fixed costs associated with extracting the metal. Historically, copper miners and explorers have outperformed bullion in bullish markets because these companies use their operating leverage to enhance future profits, potentially boosting share prices.
2. **The Trade:** I’m looking for serious gains on this one, but I’m flexible with my entry point.

* **Entry:** $0.756 & higher
* **Targets:** $0.90, $0.935, $0.95, & $1+ (if you get an entry around $0.75 or so, make sure to take gains when you see them)
* **Long term target:** about $3
* **SL:** $0.59 (please follow your own risk management rules! $0.59 is quite a big SL)

**Reasons why I like this entry point:**

* Sitting on historic support that has seen wicked gains
* A big sell-off has granted us a favorable price point
* Favorable risk/reward, in my opinion

**So there ya have it.** This is my copper play! Throw this one on the watchlist - CLLXF!",1720476553,829460,Jacale1,t2_1thx1lvy,cb8862b131230ead4c644251cc55d8f03fde5c770fd4b34ef067226e9995e17b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dylovy/bullish_on_copper_heres_why_cllxf_stands_out/
2306,"Luca Mining (Ticker = LUCA.v, Mcap $101M): Driving Growth with Gold, Copper, Zinc, Silver, and Lead Production in Mexico – Aiming to Produce 60K - 70K Oz Au Equivalent in 2024","Luca Mining (Ticker: LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors) is a diversified Canadian mining company operating two fully-owned producing mines in Mexico, specializing in gold, copper, zinc, silver, and lead. These mines have substantial development and resource potential.

LUCA's Campo Morado mine, an underground operation in Guerrero State, Mexico, produces copper-zinc-lead concentrates with precious metals credits. It is currently undergoing an optimization program to improve recoveries, grades, efficiencies, and cashflows.

The Tahuehueto Gold and Silver Mine in Durango State, Mexico, is LUCA's new underground operation. Located in the Sierra Madre Mineral Belt, the mine is completing the installation of major equipment and commissioning its mill to 1,000 tonnes per day, aiming to increase production by the second half of 2024.

Luca Mining anticipates generating positive cash flows in 2024 and is focused on growth to maximize shareholder returns. For 2024, the company has set guidance for consolidated production and sales between 60,000 to 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent, with revenue projected between $90 million and $105 million. Consolidated total cash costs are expected to be between $1,200 and $1,335 per ounce of gold equivalent produced, and all-in sustaining costs between $1,320 and $1,500 per ounce.

https://preview.redd.it/x10shxj4tdbd1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6895ff2ecc85c848acf67a4cf1fdf0843f3ccfa

Key milestones for 2024 include expanding throughput at both mills, declaring commercial production at Tahuehueto, adding a separate copper concentrate at Campo Morado, and starting major exploration programs at both properties. President Ramon Perez highlighted the company’s progress and the potential for significant cash flow growth in the second half of the year and beyond.

In Q1, Luca produced 14.1K ounces of gold equivalent with the mines operating at a fraction of their potential capacities. The company is focused on increasing capacity, nearing full production targets. 

At Tahuehueto, the new mill is 97% complete, with the final component installed to ramp up production significantly by Q3 and Q4 2024. Recent high-grade gold discoveries at Tahuehueto indicate potential for resource expansion.

At Campo Morado, the company is ramping up to 2,000 tpd, recently achieving 1,800 tpd. The plan includes producing three high-quality concentrates (copper, zinc, and lead) to improve cash flows. The company’s ongoing metallurgical test work supports this goal, with completion expected in Q3.

2310,$RNXT Shares Close +5% on Monday 7/8,"With all the excitement and returns in the biotech world, $RNXT has been one of my top tickers lately. It’s been a wild ride, and I know many of you can relate to the highs and lows of trading. I gotta admit it’s been pretty hard finding these undervalued stocks

If you’re new to the money-making BioTech sector of the Stock Market, RenovoRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNXT) is a late-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative and technological solutions for difficult-to-treat cancers.

RenovoRx.’s [\~TAMP platform technology\~](https://renovorx.com/tamp/) is designed to ensure precision chemotherapy treatments, allowing access to tumors that were previously thought to be untreatable, such as pancreatic cancer.

$RNXT’s TAMP technology is at the forefront of their staple product, the RenovoGem. It was announced last week that RenovoRx launched patient enrollment at Nebraska University for their Phase III Clinical trial for TAMP and RenovoGem, where the technology is being compared to the existing invasive and difficult process of pancreatic cancer treatment.

Today, $RNXT share price gapped up +5%!

This is likely the concussive effects of RenovoRx [\~announcing acceptance for publication\~](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renovorx-announces-acceptance-publication-international-123000075.html) in an international peer-reviewed journal, [\~The Oncologist\~](https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1549490x); a publication dedicated to translating the latest research developments into the best multidimensional care for cancer patients.

This may seem like small news for a BioTech company, but for a stock that has a price target of $8 by next year, this could be huge. Given that the Phase III pAc-trials are a success, RenovoGem will be featured on a centralized newsletter surrounding pancreatic cancer treatments, $RNXT’s primary target market.

With their recent appointment of Senior Vice President Ryan Witt, as well as having the ball rolling on their top-of-the-line innovative product, my optimism remains high around holding my position.

Has anybody else been keeping up with BioTech lately? Any other tickers I should add to my watchlist? Always open to feedback!

2319,"Market Responds to JPOW… 7-9-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","If you remember yesterday most of the time day one has been green when JPOW testifies we are bullish… however today we did get a pretty flat to neutral day…

https://preview.redd.it/n6g66rmrujbd1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=e623a735b09cfd4ac8b8f9ac152d7af372c669ee

I find it very interesting that the market has not opened red on day two of testimonies… however it has closed red quite frequently on day two…

https://preview.redd.it/6u2wciyrujbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68f4adaf36ce76a5797a662403490212dc2bf26

Remember JPOW will once again be speaking tomorrow and we will get the 10yr bond auction at 1pm which certainly will cause some movement in this market leading into CPI on Thursday. I will have a better analysis for you guys of CPI tomorrow night!

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/4oqm0v8sujbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1215e8313cf8f864056f903901271801a0ce66d

Most impressively here on SPY we did NOT get a new daily supply. However, we put in our second red doji day today. We also again are seeing weaker daily buyers which continues to support my theory of a backtest of the daily 8ema support is coming. SPY still has not taken back daily extreme bull momentum here.

Bulls will look to break out to 560+ tomorrow.

Bears again will be targeting a drop back to the daily 8ema support near 552.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/mwdwgxjsujbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a50a19e1b4604688381fde276958e0bb28a801

Here on ES we once again have a wick to the upside and completed a doji here… we did not get a true reversal pattern here though. We are seeing daily buyers hold on for dear life but I do expect that likely they will weak overnight and into tomorrow which could set up a red day for us.

We did not get a new daily supply (resistance) today either but I do expect that could again come tomorrow.

Bulls need to target once again a new ATH.

Bears will look to backtest daily 8ema support near 5600.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562  
Demand- 5532

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/3yoxid7uujbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=919be988467e1da759e321d2f4ee6a0ea0a2b7c3

This is where Tech and SPY are diverging. I generally favor the trend of tech over the general market as usually tech is in charge due to the heavy market caps of tech.

We on QQQ did get our weaker daily buyers and we did get a new supply at 497.34 today. We could be seeing a potential reversal candle here that would likely set us up for the daily 8ema retest I have been talking about. QQQ is however, barely holding onto daily extreme bull momentum.

Bulls need to retake 500 (which was my target if you remember) and close over it now.

Bears will look for that daily 8ema support retest near 491-492 area.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 485.26  
Demand- 471.93 -> 476.05 -> 479.05

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/fg138x6tujbd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e040b355dbcfb85f99880a58a5ebfbca5854733

Similarly here on NQ to QQQ we got a new daily supply at 20685. However, this is a far more obvious and strong daily double top/ doji rejection here. This pattern with weaker daily buyers and the new daily supply generally speaking does open us up to a higher potential of a red day tomorrow. The biggest bullish thing we have is the tiny amount of extreme bull momentum that we are holding onto still.

Bulls need to seek out 20800 to continue this rally.

Bears will look to retest the daily 8ema support near 20400 tomorrow.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 20068 -> 20214  
Demand- 19952 -> 19967

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Honestly a pretty solid day of trading for me today. I think with the pretty relentlessly painful trading we have had for the last few weeks this was one of the first days I didn’t start out in the hole. Looking to continue the momentum into tomorrow and the EOW.

I gotta stop trading power hour… especially short… no matter how dang good it looks. Just hard to believe that the final 10 minutes of the day every single day can be bullish like this…",1720555493,829480,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,c1b0a1d25e1903d910b923687da1a8c760aea307e6c01369b2613eaece24c571,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1dzc1xw/market_responds_to_jpow_7924_spy_es_futures_and/

2322,"TODAY: West Red Lake Gold Mines Reports Significant Drill Results at North Austin Zone (3.40 g/t Au over 10m, 12.21 g/t Au over 3m & more)","Today, West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) announced promising drill results from its 100% owned Madsen Mine, located in the Red Lake Gold District of Northwestern Ontario, Canada. This latest update highlights the significant potential of the project's North Austin Zone, a new area of high-grade mineralization that extends the current Madsen resource to the northeast.

**Geological Context**

The North Austin Zone, situated in the footwall of the main Austin Zone, is part of a larger mineralized system characterized by broad, kilometer-scale alteration and deformation corridors. The area has been subjected to intense deformation and high-temperature metamorphism, leading to the formation of a skarn-like replacement mineral assemblage.

https://preview.redd.it/75hw9rii0lbd1.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3bccf93db343ec1ffa348530dea46521615028f

Gold mineralization at the Madsen Mine is typically identified by fine grains of free gold within strong alteration and veining. The presence of pervasive silicification and quartz-carbonate or diopside veining further indicates high-grade zones within the mineralized structure.

**Drill Results Overview**

The recent drilling program, conducted from underground, was aimed at expanding the North Austin Zone both down-plunge and to the northeast. The results were noteworthy, with multiple high-grade intersections, including:

* **10 meters at 13.40 g/t Au**, including 1.0 meter at 85.61 g/t Au.
* **3 meters at 12.21 g/t Au**, including 1.0 meter at 32.84 g/t Au.
* **16.98 meters at 3.12 g/t Au**, including 0.98 meter at 11.78 g/t Au and 0.79 meter at 15.60 g/t Au.

These intersections are significant, as they not only confirm the presence of high-grade gold mineralization but also suggest the potential for further resource expansion in the North Austin Zone.

**Future Outlook**

WRLG's current underground drilling program at the Madsen Mine focuses on defining near-term mining inventory and expanding the current mineral resource. The strategy includes targeting the more continuous and higher-grade portions of the Austin, South Austin, and North Austin Zones, with continued drilling planned into 2025.

Shane Williams, President & CEO of WRLG, highlighted the significance of the recent drill results and the company's future plans, stating, “With the team now working towards a planned mine restart in the second half of 2025, the drills at Madsen will continue to delineate and define the high-value mineral inventory needed to support that objective.”

2327,CLLXF Trade Setup Looks Promising,"Hello and happy Wednesday, everyone! I’m excited to share my trade setup for CLLXF. This one’s got me particularly pumped due to the recent announcement of a massive copper resource find—over 400 million pounds!

We’re feeling confident about this one, so let’s give it some breathing room. However, seeing some solid movement and volume soon would be great.

**Entry:** $0.756 & higher

**Targets:** $0.90, $0.935, $0.95, & $1+ (If you get an entry around $0.75 or so, make sure to take gains when you see them)

* Targets are juicy, looking for this one to perform well.

**Long-term target:** about $3

**SL:** $0.59 (Please obey your own risk management rules! $0.59 is quite a big SL)

**Additional comments:**

* Bounced hard off a very strong and historical support zone—especially on the daily and weekly charts.
* Copper prices and value have been skyrocketing over the past few years; this is a great way to get exposure.
* Has a history of volume and price surges—great exit liquidity.

I hope you all have a fantastic trading day today. Good luck!

2356,"Markets Tumble Post Cold CPI… Lets Talk About it! 7-11-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Well if you saw my CPI post last night you know that I pretty much (like JPM) saw today as pretty much a win win for the bulls. There was very little odds of getting a hotter CPI print than previous. Historically speaking markets rarely sell off on a cool CPI print.. so what gives? Why are we selling off today? Lets get into it…

https://preview.redd.it/sef7vzy45ybd1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=d35e280136718e58e34114ad3581b01e56518ae8

I am honestly always amazed by this market and its ability to surprise us… leaving 2023 and heading into 2024 the market at one point had 7 rate cuts priced in and for a long time we had March 2024 as the first rate cut… however, of course over time we learned that the market was wrong and overzealous like usual. We eventually pulled back to where we are now about 25-50bps of cuts before EOY. However, until today we did not really get much of a negative reaction to that.

Here is why in my opinion we are seeing the weakness today… the market is finally facing reality in my opinion…

https://preview.redd.it/10j0ezb55ybd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=698fd4cf57defc595f907828326e0e17ff24f705

It all starts with Unemployment. You may be wondering why it starts with that… lets think what JPOW has been trying to broadcast for basically the last two years… he has been trying to broadcasts a scenario where we get a SOFT LANDING… essentially this is the picture perfect case for the FED… where the economy (jobs, etc.) stay strong AND they get inflation to decrease allowing them to cut rates… this is a win win as inflation comes down but the market doesn’t suffer… However, if you look at the chart above you can see that the UE (unemployment rate) is rising at a pretty strong pace… we are now at 4.1% UE which is the highest level since December 2021…

Now lets look at the CPI YoY from today…

https://preview.redd.it/tzmh0sq55ybd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9733992d5569f68ecaf7498df4b1d85a7ae78bc4

Now this is where we hit speculation time… CPI officially came down to 3%... we came mighty close to seeing our first two handle on CPI since April 2021… We however are once again sitting on the bottom of our range of 3-3.7% that we have held in since July 2023 (officially a year now).

The market may finally be realizing that inflation indeed is coming down which is great! However, JPOW since December 2023 has been telling the market not to worry because the soft landing (low UE/ Strong economy with inflation returning to normal) was coming. However, he can not say that anymore… we very well are heading into the worse case scenario for the FED and frankly our economy… where we see a massive spike in UE and we bring rates down at the same time…

Not to mention the historical precedence that we almost always see a market correction/ crash once the fed starts to cut… If you look at the heat map from today…

https://preview.redd.it/cuduik265ybd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a50853417a7a43ef0afaacb1ff61c2d46dd149f

You can see who your biggest losers were and that was Big tech! the most interesting thing is the massive rally on the russel today… there is a very clear rotation here.

Now what truly matters in my opinion is what happens tomorrow… IF we get the standard market buy the dip here tomorrow then this was just a one off event of some massive profit taking in big tech and likely we continue our monotonous rally higher… however, if market gets a continuation day lower then we are likely looking at a sustained shift in the markets direction here.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/0ccn8he65ybd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f8918a2e0f3152ed499e4cded74b94755602a13

We finally got our long awaited supply today on SPY at 561.42. This is a pretty impressive daily double top rejection off this supply also. However, as you can see the markets here on ES continue to hold the daily 8ema support. In general, I still find it risky to be bearish until we close 541.39 – 545.23 triple demand/ support area.

We obviously did weaken our daily buyers today, however, we again remain in extreme bull momentum. When we are in extreme bull momentum we almost always buy the dip off that 8ema support. I generally am anticipating a push back up tomorrow. Historically markets take more than one data peace to take us lower for a sustained period of time.

Bulls will look to reach back up to 561.42 supply.

Bears need to close under daily 8ema support to then target the triple demand/ support area of 541.39-545.23.

Much like SPY we did get a nice daily double top rejection with a new daily supply at 5685 today. We again have weaker daily buyers but remain in extreme bull momentum. While this a really nice daily double top I would again not be shocked to see a daily double bottom as we held daily 8ema support and we also did not completely bearishly engulf yesterdays candle.

Bulls for now remain in control as long as daily 8ema support holds. They need to push this back closer to 5685.

Bears must break through daily 8ema support of 5616 and look for the 5332-5562 support area.

Big tech of course was the talk of the town today… a massive drop in daily buying support. I have said now for about a week maybe two that big tech has NOT been leading this rally… for quite a while now tech has been struggling and ES/SPY has absolutely been holding up price action. Today ES was not able to keep tech alive. This is where I think the biggest bear case does come is from tech being sold off. IF we continue to see this rotation out of tech… spy can realistically only hold itself up so long…

With a massive drop in daily buyers today, breaking back out of daily extreme bull momentum and seeing a new daily support at 502.99 we are starting to approach a drop here… we are fighting at this daily 8ema support area and I don’t expect to go down easily.

Bulls need to recover this drop tomorrow and close back over previous demand of 497.71.

Bears will look to backtest daily 20ema support near 485.26 supply tomorrow.

A truly impressive move on NQ today hitting 606+ points of range which is over double its usually 10 day average daily range. With this massive hit in daily buyers and new supply at 20897 it is hard to not see a downside case here… todays daily bearish engulfing candle is a big hit for bulls to overcome. We are also looking at a nearly month long rising wedge here on the daily that could easily set this market up for a major correction.

Bulls must retake 20600 tomorrow to stay in control.

Bears need to firmly break the rising wedge and target a drop back to 19951-19966 daily double demand support which is just under daily 20ema support.

I know we have not talked about the VIX is quite some time… however, I think its important to mention today because it shows how this drop is different than usual. In general when we see a big red day like this (and NQ hitting over -2% is a major drop) we almost always see a significant move up on the VIX… The VIX I believe at max todays was up 3-4%... this tells me we are actually NOT seeing long term hedges being put on (remember VIX is 28dte+). Now some of this truly is likely due to the 0dte everyday craze… but I also believe what we are seeing when we look at the major drop on NQ relative to the smaller drop on ES is that this was strictly a rotation (take profits) out of big tech and not an actual market induced sell off…

Another thing that was interesting today is that ES had a negative breadth (buying pressure) and NQ/ NYSE had a positive breadth… however, as you can see NQ got hit the hardest. What does this mean? This means tomorrow is a big day… I am genuinely curious to see the market reaction tomorrow. VIX has held this 11.85-13.85 range ($2 range) since basically May with a few days of exception. Historically the VIX has not liked to stay in the 11s for very long… IF we see the VIX breakout in a major way that will be our confirmation of sustained downside coming.

2357,"Copper Prices Exceed $10,000 as PRIZ Plans for Drilling in Arizona's Copper Belt","Copper prices recently surged past $10,000 per tonne, after Citigroup analysts forecasted that copper prices might continue to rise due to expected policy support from China, particularly in renewable energy and infrastructure investments anticipated to be announced at the Third Plenum meeting in mid-July.

The bank also noted that copper consumption in the first half of 2024 showed a robust year-over-year growth of around 4%. Additionally, long-term copper prices could reach $12,000 per tonne, supported by anticipated rate cuts in major economies.

Prismo Metals Inc. (Ticker: PRIZ.c or PMOMF for US investors) focuses on exploration for copper and precious metals in the US and Mexico respectively. Its Hot Breccia project, located in Arizona's copper belt, shows promise for significant copper mineralization.

https://preview.redd.it/mlpgp0848ybd1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=546fd9e6ceda8f201abd65817c9d1ecabbd62276

Arizona, a key player in copper mining, has ten major mines producing between 23 and 632 million pounds of copper annually. The state boasts a strong mining infrastructure, including highways, water access, power lines, and facilities like the Hayden smelter and Asarco concentrator.

The Hot Breccia project covers 1,420 hectares, approximately 4 kilometers south of the historic Christmas mine, which yielded 363 million pounds of copper, 2.1 million ounces of silver, and 55,026 ounces of gold from 25 million tons of ore.Hot Breccia is believed to contain high-grade copper skarn mineralization similar to the Christmas mine, despite being covered by volcanic rocks. 

Recent exploration revealed samples with copper concentrations up to 5.69%, alongside 0.24 g/t gold and 32.8 g/t silver, indicating significant porphyry-related mineralization at depth.

PRIZ plans to begin drilling at Hot Breccia soon, with permits expected shortly. The drilling plan includes drilling 5 1,000m-deep holes.

PRIZ is well-funded for this initiative, having raised $1,147,500 through a private placement in June, aiming to fully unlock Hot Breccia's potential, take advantage of a surging copper market driven by anticipated Chinese policy support, and provide attractive opportunities for stakeholders.

When you look at this weekly candle one of the things that I think is most impressive is the fact that we had the “major” drop on Thursday yet our SPY candle barely broke below its opening… the markets did a nice job of padding the upside cushion.

We have officially put in a new supply at 554.7 which of course gives us an imbalanced close. Now I would say 99% of the time that we find this lately that has resulted in the following week being very bullish to then turn that supply into demand (support). As you can see here we have formed a massive rising wedge here on the weekly (we also have one on the daily too).

We remain in extreme weekly bull momentum and despite the new supply this week we have stronger weekly buyers still. In general bulls likely will continue this run up next week.

Bulls new target is 570.

Bears need to close under 554.7.

Nearly identical setup here on ES… we are seeing stronger weekly buyers (and honestly quite a nice pop on them) but we of course not a new supply at 5614 which leaves the market currently imbalanced. To rectify this we need to either close back under 5614 next week or the more probable solution will be to push higher and then turn this supply into demand (Support) to rebalance.

Much like on SPY here we have stronger weekly buyers, we remain very firmly in extreme bull momentum on the weekly timeframe and in general we are just riding the daily 8ema support higher and higher.

Bulls need to target a closure between 5750 and 5800.

Bears will look to close back under 5614.

If you follow me on the daily you know I have been talking about (Especially intraday) the massive divergence that ES and NQ (spy/ qqq) has had for nearly a month straight now. The weeklies here show that even better here. On SPY/ ES we realistically are set  up for a continuation higher next week… which makes a lot of sense considering that ES/ SPY have realistically been keeping this market alive and pushing us higher and higher for the last few weeks (tech is NOT driving this right now).

Now on this weekly here for QQQ we have a very strong and clearly weekly rejection here with this double top doji. In reality this pattern should and could play out a very nice retrace for us next week. However, there are a few things working against the bearish price action set  up…

On QQQ since April we have been in this really nice yellow bull channel. While we did get a nice double top rejection here in general the weekly 8ema support perfectly runs with the support line of the bull channel. I would expect that if we do retrace next week that we will not break any lower than 482.6 area. This is where the weekly 8ema and weekly bull channel support will be.

Now from a bearish stand point here we have a new supply with the double top at 496.33, we actually DID get weaker weekly buyers here and we have the nice price action setup. My target of course is the 482.6 area.

Now from a bullish stand point we remain of course in weekly extreme bull momentum here which a lot of times will trump technicals and price action. We also of course have the more bullish case of ES/ SPY who are obviously driving this market right now.

Bulls will target 510+.

Bears will target 477.71.

NQ also has a nice double top doji rejection with the new supply at 20587. Now of course we have the weaker weekly buyers here on Nq which all supports further downside for next week and a temporary retrace setting up. Our yellow bull channel support is near 19775, however the weekly 8ema support will be closer to the 19955 demand which is my target for next week if we are weak.

Bulls could easily while in extreme weekly bull momentum buy this right back up and push us back over ATHs and target 21000.

I forgot to Friday when I took off early to grab a screenshot of my weekly results but here is my Friday.

Overall I had a great day for the most part. I was able to grab a huge win in one of my accounts, unfortunately took a decent hit in one of my accounts and then had a solid day in my other account. I was looking for the first big retrace and that finally came which allowed me to pass another eval to add some more backups.

In general, this week was REALLY rough on me… I still struggle wanting to play shorts due to me strategy being that of mean reversion and technical/ price action. Unfortunately this market with the extremely low volume continues to play out as a buy the dip only market. I really continue to see so many similarities between this summer and last summer. I really am looking to adjust some of my trading and focus more on long opportunities than short opportunities.

The way I am seeing it now longs have a higher probability win but not always more gains… shorts have a way lower probability of wins but when the short finally comes its usually a big winner.",1720874886,829580,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,4199cfc150c42f5c4e2552513ab21266d2255282edffc48894844a43a32f1d0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1e29mqv/earnings_season_has_arrived_71324_spy_es_futures/

The movement to reschedule canna bis reflects a broader acknowledgment of its medical benefits and the necessity for regulatory reform. Currently classified as a Schedule I substance, canna bis is deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, placing it alongside heroin. This classification imposes severe restrictions on research, commerce, and taxation of canna bis-related activities.

**Financial Relief and Industry Growth**

One of the most immediate and impactful changes of rescheduling canna bis to Schedule III would be the elimination of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. This provision currently prohibits canna bis businesses from deducting typical business expenses, leading to disproportionately high tax burdens compared to other industries. Allowing these deductions would align the tax treatment of canna bis businesses with other sectors, significantly boosting profitability.

Eliminating Section 280E restrictions could free up substantial funds for reinvestment in operations, research and development, and market expansion. Lower operational costs could also be passed on to consumers, making medical canna bis more accessible and affordable. Improved tax conditions could reduce the stigma associated with canna bis businesses, facilitating easier access to loans, credit lines, and other financial services.

**Broader Economic and Social Implications**

The potential rescheduling of c annabis carries far-reaching implications beyond financial relief for businesses. Advocacy groups and social workers have been vocal in urging President Biden to fully decriminalize mari juana, arguing that rescheduling alone does not address the systemic injustices caused by decades of prohibition. Nearly 150 social workers recently urged the President to remove m arijuana entirely from the CSA, highlighting the disproportionate impact on communities of color and the ongoing social and economic harms of criminalization.

The current patchwork of state and local laws has created significant disparities in opportunities and outcomes across the country. While communities in legal states benefit from regulated mariju ana sales and the economic opportunities they bring, other areas continue to face severe penalties. Full decriminalization could mitigate these disparities, ensuring more equitable access to the benefits of legalization.

**Opportunities for Growth and Innovation**

The rescheduling of ca nnabis could unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation within the industry. Companies would be able to deduct business expenses, leading to increased profitability and the potential for reinvestment in various areas, including research, development, and expansion into new markets. This financial relief could also result in lower prices for consumers, making medical cann abis more accessible and affordable.

Additionally, reduced stigma and improved financial services could facilitate easier access to loans, credit lines, and banking services, further supporting business expansion. Enhanced tax relief could foster more competitive market pricing, decreasing the allure of the illicit market and driving industry growth.

**How companies could benefit from Rescheduling**

One company that stands to benefit significantly from these changes is InterCure, known as Canndoc in Israel. Founded in 2008, InterCure has established itself as a leader in the pharmaceutical c annabis sector, producing high-quality, GMP-standard cannab is. The company’s vertically integrated model, which controls cultivation, processing, distribution, and sales through its network of 29 pharmacies in Israel, allows it to maximize profitability and maintain operational flexibility.

**Expansion into Europe**

According to a recent analyst report by Zuanic and Associates, InterCure’s strategic initiatives in Europe, particularly in Germany, underscore its growth potential. The German medical ca nnabis market is experiencing rapid expansion due to regulatory reforms that have removed can nabis from the list of narcotic substances. This change facilitates easier access to medical ca nnabis and could lead to full insurance coverage, similar to other medications under comprehensive German health insurance.

Moreover, according to the same report, InterCure’s experience in the highly regulated Israeli market provides a competitive edge as it expands into Europe. The company’s expertise in producing pharmaceutical-grade cannabi s, combined with its established partnerships, positions it well to capture significant market share in Germany and other European countries.

**Potential Impact in the U.S. Market**

The report also highlights that while InterCure’s success in Europe is notable, its potential for growth in the U.S. market could be even more transformative. The company’s expertise in meeting stringent regulatory standards and producing high-quality medical ca nnabis positions it well to enter the U.S. market, especially if c annabis is rescheduled to Schedule III. This rescheduling would not only allow InterCure to benefit from the same financial relief as other U.S. companies but also leverage its established pharmaceutical-grade production capabilities.

2384,"Markets Find Temporary Top… 7-15-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Coming into this week we did have a decently strong bearish setup on both the weekly and daily timeframes. Bulls of course after hours had all the strength in the world. However, with JPOW speaking again today markets had to struggle to hold support. Today was much like Friday a very volatile day that led to a power hour dump.

**SPY DAILY**



https://preview.redd.it/847k72h9oqcd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3f61f7acf088462c6062584b967628bc8e5cf8

Going into this week 561.42 was the clear cut daily resistance that we needed to keep our eye on. Its no surprise that todays intraday retrace came after rejecting that level. Bulls continue to fight here, however, to a bit of surprise we continue to NOT see stronger daily buyers. That is likely why today and Friday both resulted in such strong rejections. This daily DOJI candle rejection here with weaker daily buyers sets us up for a nice potential retrace. 561.42 is critical resistance as I mentioned and I have critical support at 556.48. Which even level breaks AND has support of sellers or buyers will likely get a sustained continuation.

SPY DAILY LELELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52 -> 561.42  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/1w9alz3aoqcd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=518c1a067799c40f69dd00f4866d1f592c787b2c

Similarly here on ES our critical resistance has been 5685 which is again where we rejected. We also struggled to see stronger daily buyers come back in today which means the upside continues to be unjustified and could easily result in a sizeable retrace until that proper support comes back in.

Much like SPY our critical support to watch sits at 5631.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562 -> 5685  
Demand- 5532

Now I think a lot of people disagree with me when I say that tech (qqq/ NQ… NOT individual tickers) is lagging this recovery… and if you disagree I encourage you to look at where ES/ SPY is compared to last weeks dump and where QQQ/ NQ is… you can see that QQQ/ NQ have barely recovery 50-60% of the full dump while ES/ SPY have breached and fully recovered that dump. Now yes some individual tickers are getting bought up like TESLA… but as a whole big tech is not moving this market…

In my opinion until big tech once again is the LEADER and not the follower/ laggard we are likely stuck in a choppy and nasty mess here.

QQQ also has much weaker daily buyers today and failed to even reach its critical resistance of 502.99 (supply). Bears have a major support at 491.84 that they need to break through.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 485.26 -> 502.99  
Demand- 479.05 -> 497.71

Identically here on NQ we are seeing no new demand, and weaker daily buyers here. We also didn’t even fully make it back to our 20897 supply which is of course our critical resistance. This doji rejection here also gives life to a possible downside move tomorrow. Realistically until buyers come back in to support this price it is going to be difficult for markets to continue to push higher.

Bulls have to defend the critical double bottom support at 20429.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS

I don’t know what it is about Monday but I have absolutely been struggling on them. Today I got whipsawed and stop loss hunted like I haven’t in a very long time. I truly just couldn’t get a direction right to save my life. Also there was a lot of platform issues with ninja and tradeovate this morning which left me sidelined for a long time and missing some decent plays. I also had one play where I entered and hit my be and saw basically and instant 30pt reversal which was completely wild… it was just some straight up brutal price action for a Monday once again. I had a nice long (so I thought) that I entered during opening hour that of course smacked my stop and instantly popped higher.

 I did lose one account (some how in the same day though mffu activated a new funded for me). I was able to thankfully recover two of my accounts from deep red to basically break even today though thankfully.

Oh, their at it again, waving around the Gale complaint like it's the Holy Grail of truth. It's amusing how they trumpet these ""allegations"" as if they're hard facts. News flash: just because you copy and paste a bunch of ""news"" reports doesn't magically turn them into gospel truth. Just like repeating a lie a thousand times might make it familiar, but it doesn't make it factual.

Let's break it down. The complaint itself admits that the allegations are based on ""information and belief."" Translation: it's a mix of what the plaintiffs think they know and what they've pieced together from some ""news"" reports (just look at all the footnotes citing Bloomberg. lmao) and a sprinkle of documents from Franchise Group.  It's like assembling a puzzle without half the pieces and declaring you've solved it.

  
Against that backdrop, the continued suggestion that Kahn individually double pledged FRG stock as loan collateral IMO is pure nonsense. This speculation was debunked months ago with public UCC documents clearly showing that Prophecy holds a secured interest from Vintage Opportunity Partners, L.P., not Kahn individually.

As Rily stated back in February: 

Over the past year, persons acting to manipulate the price of the Company's stock and to profit from that manipulation have sought to overwhelm the Company and its partners, advisors, employees and clients with baseless claims of alleged wrongdoing by B. Riley Financial, often accompanied by outrageous personal harassment. Their actions have far exceeded the acceptable limits of financial research and are an attempt to actively damage our business to justify their inaccurate claims. **Their behavior is inexcusable, and their claims lack merit.** Critically, B. Riley Financial does not owe - and never owed - any debt, of any nature, to Mr. Kahn on account of the resolution of the Rent-A-Center litigation. There was not a ""client revenue sharing agreement"" with Mr. Kahn, and the transactions with Mr. Kahn and his companies were on market terms. B. Riley Financial has a perfected first-lien security interest in the ownership interests in Freedom VCM Holdings, LLC (FRG's post-transaction parent entity) currently collateralizing its loan with Vintage Capital, the certificates are in B. Riley Financial's possession, and the Board remains confident in the long-term investment thesis for Freedom and FRG.

2406,"SPY and QQQ Continue to Diverge… 7-16-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Today is another great example of how tech is NOT leading this rally… it actually is impressive (and a bit frustrating) watching the clear and perfect bearish setups on NQ form to then look at ES who has a similar setup forming. However, instead of watching ES follow through and confirm the bearish setup we are seeing bullish support seemingly out of no where come in and completely negate and reverse all the bearish movement. This is very difficult and at times senseless movement we are seeing. Low volume summer trading is never fun and this summer feels even less fun that the past.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/ecwtdfs8txcd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb67227b486ef94c1703b20270a61f37fa462eec

In probably one of the most impressive and unique supply/ demand moves I have ever seen we turned our supply from 7/10/24 into a demand today. Now usually we need to see an imbalanced close in order to turn a supply into a demand, I honestly do not think I have ever seen a time when a supply has been turned into demand like this.

With supply now turned into demand at 561.58 this is considered our line in the sand. As I have mentioned SPY/ ES are clearly what is holding this market up right now. SPY has made a new ATHs while NQ hasn’t even recovered the full drop yet. We also saw a return of stronger daily buyers on SPY today and SPY maintained extreme bull momentum on the daily (which may account for some of this goofy strength we are seeing).

As of right now until we can get a strong and true closure under the daily 8ema support on SPY/ ES it is very difficult to be bearish as our best case bear scenario is consolidation.

SPY DAILY LELELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23 -> 561.58

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Now here on ES they snuck in a demand at 5639 yesterday right before the 5pm closure. So not only are we seeing ES and NQ divergence but we are actually seeing SPY and ES divergence in the supply/ demand stand point. For ES here our critical demand/ support is 5639 and now that we were finally able to breach and close/ hold over 5685 that is our key support to watch.

Much like SPY until bears can break us through the daily 8ema support we are just in a bullish/ consolidation chop area. Despite stronger daily buyers and extreme bull momentum here on the daily we are really struggling to make upside moves and breakout… which honestly isn’t surprising being that NQ is not joining nor leading this rally.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562 -> 5685  
Demand- 5532 -> 5639

I continue to feel bearish (to neutral) on this market as QQQ and NQ just do not want to join in this upside movement here… not only did daily buyers on QQQ weaken again today, not only did we lose extreme daily bull momentum but we also tested and hard rejected off the previous daily demand (support) of 497.71. Now despite all of that we actually impressively are holding onto daily 8ema support. Truly the only thing holding up tech in my opinion right now is SPY and Es.

I have critical support at 491.83 and I have critical resistance at 497.71 now and then 502.99.

I don’t see this market going anywhere anytime fast until QQQ and NQ either join the rally or ES and SPY finally join the weakness.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 485.26 -> 502.99

Here on NQ we are seeing one of those famous major failed recoveries here on the supply/ demand indicator. Those are some of the strongest upside or downside moves I have ever seen. However, we continue to despite weaker daily buyers just barely hold onto the daily 8ema support.

Here on NQ I have critical support at 20435 and I have critical resistance at 20626 (our daily double top from today) and then 20897.

Overall a pretty solid day of trading. I took an early short which of course got stop loss hunted before we started our solid move down on NQ… was able to grab some nice ES shorts. Found my Breakeven stop loss hunted hard before I was able to get a nice short win again on NQ…

2421,"Markets Tumble… 7-17-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Yesterday and really for the last two weeks I have been saying that tech has been attempting to push this market lower and the only thing preventing that is ES/ SPY (and DOW/ Russels abnormal strength). Today on the backs of some Chips news big tech took a massive overnight tumble and this time not even the broader market could hold it up.

Its actually funny that I mentioned on TECH last night that from a supply and demand perspective that we had a MAJOR failed recovery which set us up for an impressively high probable and big downside move… I would call a nearly 3% drop (600pts) a major move down…

The only question to be answered now is… will markets immediately buy the dip like they did on July 12^(th)? Or are we about to see a major follow on red day to start a potentially bigger correction? Well lets dig into it here and find out…

 

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/saagz40j05dd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=046e4e03f85e36dc388805848f24de224ca314c0

Yesterday I mentioned on SPY that we had that phenomenon where we turned a previous supply into demand that was not in the normal fashion we see that happen. Well with this major rejection here we are seeing a new supply at 564.94 here on SPY. We had a major rejection and closed not only below the previous demand/ support of 561.58 but we finally after 9 consecutive days of breaking out higher and higher over the daily 8ema support have closed below it.

As you can see by the red trend line we are still in a short term extreme bull channel higher but not only that we are in a year plus long bull channel (yellow lines). If you remember my critical support was 556.5 on SPY and we bounced within 6 cents of being directly on that level today. As bearish as it is to have such a major drop here on markets, new supply, and weaker buyers I would still like to see markets CLOSE under this level before I start to believe true weakness comes to this market.

The way I see it is that IF SPY gets a follow through red day tomorrow and we can get a closure under daily 20ema support of 552.27 before the EOW AND most importantly the algos don’t rotate bullishness back to tech then I would not be surprised to see a bigger move down to the 541.39-545.23 triple demand/ support area. However, IF we see algos buy this dip and we can recover back over the daily 8ema resistance tomorrow near 558.34 then there is a very good chance that SPY will make a run back to 564.94 into the end of next week.

SPY DAILY LELELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52 -> 564.94  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23 -> 561.58

 

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

Now yesterday I mentioned that on ES we had a much different looking setup than we did on SPY for the supply/ demand. Today we put in a new supply at 5719 and came all the way back to our critical demand/ support of 5639. With a breakdown and closure under the daily critical demand here this gives a higher probability of follow through lower.

We have realistically since 7/10/24 been trading inside a nice 77pt range. While we did get a new supply and we did see buyers weaken I generally while remaining barely in extreme bull momentum on the ES daily have a hard time believing that we are going to see follow through tomorrow.  

Bulls need to recover back over 5650 and daily 8ema resistance tomorrow minimally.

Bears need to close and hold under 5639 with a target of 5591 which is the daily 20ema support.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562 -> 5716  
Demand- 5532 -> 5639

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/6hdjmmqj05dd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3902b8dad641fb5c66ac48080589a829a6f63b7b

If you thought that SPY was goofy from a daily technical perspective well here on QQQ we have an even more interesting move… As I mentioned the massive daily failed recovery played out I mean pretty darn perfectly. Could have expected or wanted to see a better technical breakdown than what we did today. Now again the question still remains to be will we bounce tomorrow or will we finally see some bearish continuation?

Here on QQQ we have daily SELLERS for the first time since June 24^(th) 2024 and the strongest sellers have been on the daily timeframe since May 2^(nd). We not only closed under daily 8ema support but we completely gapped down below the daily 8ema support and closed well below the daily 20ema support. This is a pretty impressive bearish breakdown here. We are coming into a pretty strong and major triple demand/ support area of 471.93 to 479.05 on the daily that we held from June 12^(th) to July 1^(st).

Bears are looking for follow through to the triple demand area of 471.93 to 479.05.

Bulls are looking for a recovery minimally back over the daily 20ema resistance of 486.9.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 502.99  
Demand- 471.93 -> 479.05 -> 497.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/xdvtyx2k05dd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=846853fab834e27cac4024d42ced11bb77298459

The major failed breakout/ recovery here on NQ played out in a very impressive 632 point drop… I generally am impressed we were able to close almost -3% day on NQ today. Now again the last time we had one of these drops the market chose to recover a majority of it the next day… however, we are actually playing out a really nice 123 rollercoaster here on the daily which does set us up for a pretty impressive follow through to the downside tomorrow.

The most bullish thing I can find here is the fact that we touched and directly bounced off 19962-19967 support almost to the point at the EOD. For bears to really be in control I would have like to see that level breached and closed under like ES did with 5639.

Bulls will look to recover minimally back over 20214 tomorrow which is the daily 20ema resistance.

Bears are going to see out continuation with our next downside targets being 19592 to 19700.

2432,How do you confirm a breakout? What do you use to spot a true reversal without getting faked out?,"Hey ya’ll, I was looking at a lot of stocks yesterday and added a few stocks from this sub as well. Specifically WCUFF and LCID  Unfortunately, I am not the best at trading just yet, but I have definitely had a couple of green weeks in a row. In my trading journal, it is very easy to spot that one of my weak spots is fakeouts. My favorite thing to trade is reversals, spotting them early and riding the wave. I have tight stop losses to keep my risk-to-reward ratio high. It is honestly how I remain profitable.

Anyways, One of the stocks, WCUFF,  has just broken a trend and has started a reversal. However, for this trade I am not too sure just yet, which is why I am asking you guys for more tricks and tips.

2439,"Bears Get Continuation… 7-18-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","The question we were all looking for was whether or not this sell off was real and sustainable… well the question has been answered and we finally see some bearish continuation. Looking  at ES here this is the first time we have had back to back days of downside continuation since middle of June… besides that we realistically have not had a true back to back days of downside movement on ES since the last week of May.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/jce3231d5cdd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6b0dee653b0cd5c0e2586b474dd4d29b50bfdf

For the first time since May 7^(th) we have daily sellers back on SPY. We have officially loss our extreme bull momentum here on the daily SPY chart too. Not only that but we have finally broken down through the daily 8 and 20ema supports.

I do expect some downside continuation tomorrow before a potential relief bounce over the weekend. Our next targets here now that we have lost the daily 20ema support for the first time since May 30^(th) is the daily 50ema support. We have not touched the daily 50ema support since May 2^(nd). That currently puts us near the triple demand lower level of support from 541.39 to 545.23.

Bulls now after basically 2.5 months straight of being in control officially have lost control. They will not be in control again until we retake the daily 8ema resistance at 556.68.

SPY DAILY LELELS  
Supply- 546.4 -> 548.52 -> 564.94  
Demand- 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23 -> 561.58

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/hjbsiged5cdd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3fdfbe261fc7538b62d35a9a2c5dd60bea5a338

After bearly holding onto the daily demand level of 5639 yesterday the bulls made an attempt to recover this morning but with weaker daily buyers were unable to hold 5639. With this demand being lost which dates back to 7/10/24 we are now set up to back test our demand/ support of 5532 from end of June. With the daily 20ema support being breached here again our target is the daily 50ema support which is also our yellow bull trend line support. We have our first daily sellers on ES since June 3^(rd).

Bulls now need to bounce here and minimally hold 5532 demand. But realistically to be back in control need to retake 5639.

Bears will look to target 5532 demand and then 50ema support near 5465.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5550 -> 5562 -> 5716  
Demand- 5532 -> 5639

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/32xdc2rd5cdd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc674118623346266f7df5007533e97ca5031fbe

Here on QQQ we finally broke our bull channel support that dates back to middle of April. With our major failed recovery yesterday and our first back to back stronger sellers since beginning of June the Qs took a major leg down once again today.

The daily 50ema support looks like a clear target here on QQQ. We have come into my target of the triple demand/ support of 471.93 to 479.05 already. But I do expect the downside move to 471.93 and the daily 50ema support to happen.

Bulls need to prevent a daily 8/ 20ema bearish cross under and retake 488.45 to be back in control again.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.59 -> 502.99  
Demand- 471.93 -> 479.05 -> 497.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/qum7us1e5cdd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb8f1c5c26ed9a4d23c743161e9b95d37ed60db

Similarly here on NQ we have stronger daily sellers back to back after our major failed breakdown. Not only that but we backtested and hard rejected the daily 20ema resistance this morning. That is honestly how I knew early on that this was about to be another major bear day. That backtest and failed recovery (again) was our sign that this is not just a one off sell off like CPI last week but rather likely a stronger correction of 5-10%. We have already dropped 5% off NQs high and 10% would put us near 18900 area.

Bulls need to retake the critical double demand/ support of 19952-19967 tomorrow and target a recovery back over the daily 8ema resistance of 20285.

Bears must defend this double demand support which is now resistance to target our next move of 19592 which is the daily 20ema support.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 20068 -> 20897  
Demand- 19952 -> 19962 -> 19967

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/qchc44de5cdd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3ced0990512aec7cd6fb6500572fd3ba71f74ef

Today is a great day to look at the VIX… one thing that makes me also believe this is a TRUE sell off and not just a one off event is that until realistically today the VIX did not have a major breakout… the VIX had been holding onto the 14.83-15.15 double supply and resistance area from May.

However, today the VIX took a major acceleration to the upside and we finally have broken through this key resistance.

We actually have a pretty impressive cup and handle that is forming here on the VIX which puts our target near 21.29-21.73. If we hit that level again that should give us about a total VIX spike of 79% which the last time we had a major correction in the market we saw a VIX spike of about 74% which was from March 21^(st) 2024 to April 19^(th) 2024 where SPY fell 5.88% and QQQ fell 8.1%.

Currently SPY has fallen 2.6% and QQQ has fallen 5.32%... that means we could be looking at about 3% more drop on SPY to the 531-532 area and QQQ could be looking at 3% more drop also to the 461 area.

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I took yesterday off because of the tradeovate issues and I also was waiting on MFFU to resolve the failed accounts… they ended up resetting my failed funded so I now actually have 4 funded accounts. They also restored two of my failed evals from that day…

I was able to pass both evals thankfully which now gives me 5 dormant passed evals (which is the max) and I have 4 funded 50k expert accounts.

I had a pretty solid day of trading. I got wicked out this morning and mid after noon due to some volatility ( not surprised) and was able to recover all of my accounts back to green. I took a trade EOD that I was early on but was able to jump back into for profits to recover that loss…

All in all a good week with all 4 accounts in the green.

Looking forward to cruising into the weekend tomorrow and doing some nice light trading to hold my green week!",1721333887,829612,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,2d220b03529e3abf344e2017b208279845312c34e13f967cf413854d093a37c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1e6l0xt/bears_get_continuation_71824_spy_es_futures_and/

2442,Due thy Diligence on RenovoRx | $RNXT,"What it do hodler crew!!!

I've recently been diving even FURTHER into RNXT, let me know what y’all think about the research…

For those who don’t already know, RenovoRx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on targeted drug delivery to treat solid tumors. Their flagship product, RenovoGem, is designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to the site of the tumor, potentially increasing efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. They are currently in clinical trials and showing promising results.

# Recent Developments:

* Clinical Trials: Ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for RenovoGem in pancreatic cancer started recently with Nebraska University
* Collaborations: Partnerships with leading cancer centers to validate their technology and expand applications.
* Financial Position: Strong financial backing and recent funding rounds to support ongoing research and development.

# Risks to Consider:

* Clinical Trial Outcomes: The success of their product heavily depends on positive clinical trial results.
* Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the FDA approval process can be lengthy and uncertain.
* Market Competition: Competing with established treatments and other emerging technologies.

I believe RNXT has strong potential due to their innovative cancer treatment. However, monitoring their clinical trial progress and financial health is crucial. Like the rest of the ever-growing biotech sector, the market potential has a chance to blow the roof off.

What are your thoughts on RenovoRx? Have you invested or are you considering investing in RNXT? Let's discuss!

2449,"Bears Power Through The Weekend… 7-19-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","We once again found a nice continuation from the bears today. Opening hour I would say that the market had as equal odds of a bounce as they did a sell off, however, in the end the bears showed solid strength.

https://preview.redd.it/kvd1ulwc5odd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa000c9e07e74741f7bc3392520d6c2228a1ff04

We continue our earnings season next week with Tesla and Google being the most notable. Due to all the chip movement this week I do suspect IBM could be of note too.

https://preview.redd.it/pw0n1g8d5odd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2c7ff3496f4a1ed7813ab6156c3bb18e28df62

The most notable data next week is PMI and GDP towards the end of the week. Outside of that a decently light data week ahead.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/w9hx586e5odd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b2756f27b002971381310ebe0ee641c60868a11

Last week the market closed out an imbalanced week with us closing the market higher than the Supply that we put in at 554.7. We have officially rebalanced this market and now we seek out what comes next. Interestingly enough this is the first true bearish engulfing weekly candle we have had on SPY since the first week of April. If you look at it while a different setup that was also the last time we had multiple weeks of downside on SPY.

In general with this hard rejection, and bearish engulfing candle here my favortism does remain to the downside. From a bearish perspective here we have much weaker buyers here now and we broke a three plus month long support line and rising wedge support this week. Bears need to drop back through the weekly 8ema support and demand at 543.87 next week to seek further continuation.

From a bullish perspective we do remain in extreme bull momentum on the weekly. Bulls continue to defend the weekly 8ema support which is our highest probable bounce area. If bulls hold support there we should look for a move back to 554.7 supply.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.21 -> 554.7  
Demand- 543.87

**ES FUTURES WEEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/2s85t7ie5odd1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=4028429c534b7fee8ba4d5ed0c476a2ff90480b8

One of the most unique things about this bearish engulfing candle here on ES is the fact that we actually had stronger weekly buyers until basically the final hour of the day where we actually took a massive hit in buying support for the week. Generally speaking much like we see on SPY this week we should see weaker buyers on a rejection like this. While we remain in extreme weekly bull momentum and we continue to defend weekly 8ema support here at 5510… there is actually a very high probability that we could see a weekly double bottom off the 8ema to take us much higher.

With the market rebalanced here it will be interesting to see if the weekend allows for markets to reverse this bearish strength of the last three trading days or not.

Bulls need to retake 5514 supply to be back in control.

Bears will look to break through 5510 the weekly 8ema support to target the rising weekly wedge breakdown to potentially as low as 5307 supply.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307 -> 5614  
Demand- 5000

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/kcpcvjve5odd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d35835e88d462774bb0ee25f7b9f0ec1f7afc94

While I think the trend of ES and SPY is important I always tend to favor the overall trend of QQQ/ NQ. Here we actually have an impressive bearish reversal. We have a very impressive evening doji star pattern that played out textbook over the last three weeks now. This is a pretty hard fast and steady rejection/ reversal off the 496.33 supply area.

We are now in the fight for weekly 8ema and weekly demand of 477.71 here. With a major drop in weekly buying support, loss of extreme weekly bull momentum and this major rejection here I do generally favor continuation to the downside.

Bulls need to bounce back towards 496.33 supply to be in control.

Bears have broken a 3 month long support channel here… they are now targeting a bigger drop back to the 450.77-458.11 support area.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 458.11 -> 496.33  
Demand- 450.77 -> 477.71

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/uijql15f5odd1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd7d36135e257cae780fd640e032cb7a365c29c4

I again think this massive doji star reversal pattern playing out here while also breaking the 3 month long bull channel support is a very impressive and bearish move for the markets next week. We also broke through weekly demand/ support at 19955 with weaker weekly buyers and a loss of weekly extreme bull momentum now.

I am generally expecting bears to attempt to take this back to the 18558-18881 support areas while bulls will need to minimally close next week over 19955.

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 18881 -> 20588  
Demand- 18558 -> 19955

Honestly despite a bit of a rough Monday (once again) I had a great week of trading. Thankfully MFFU made everything right/ whole again with the tradeovate issues so I once again am sitting pretty good here going into the weekend.

I have found I need to sit out the first 30-45 minutes again and be a little more patient. We are seeing with the VIX near 16-17 again a far deal more of volatility and that means we have to be more careful with our entries… instead of entering on a good 15min reversal we may need to enter the 15min reversal but utilize a 5min candle to do so.",1721479178,829646,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,c6ee8e17ac05596f123112dc74985da9931d6bad326b1f6d700a043f84d5a190,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1e7uq6a/bears_power_through_the_weekend_71924_spy_es/

2453,Nuvectis Pharma: A Dark Horse in the U.S. Precision Medicine Race? FastTracked Orphan Drug and Promising Initial Resutls (NASDAQ: NVCT),"The U.S. precision medicine market is expected to balloon from $24.95 billion in 2023 to a whopping $76.12 billion by 2033. That's a massive CAGR of 11.80%! Amid this explosive growth, one player, Nuvectis Pharma (NASDAQ: NVCT), seems poised to potentially carve out its niche.

**Why Nuvectis Pharma?**

Founded in 2020, Nuvectis Pharma has quickly established itself in the forefront of precision medicine, focusing on personalized cancer treatments. Under the guidance of industry vet Ron Bentsur, the company boasts a promising pipeline targeting some really tough cancers.

* **NXP800 and NXP900**: These are not your average drug candidates. NXP800 is showing potential in ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, while NXP900 is aimed at tackling YES1-driven squamous cell cancers and may help overcome resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.
* **Strategic Moves**: Not only are they pushing the envelope with their research, but they've also secured Fast Track Designation from the FDA for NXP800. This is big news, as it highlights the unmet medical need and could speed up the drug’s market entry.
* **The Market**: With precision medicine reshaping healthcare, companies that offer effective and personalized solutions stand to gain the most. Nuvectis is aiming high, looking to address critical unmet needs in oncology.

**What's the play?**

Given the aggressive growth of the precision medicine sector and Nuvectis Pharma's focused approach on cancer, NVCT might just be the dark horse that could provide substantial gains. They're not just riding the precision medicine wave; they're looking to lead the charge with groundbreaking treatments.

2458,"OpenAI is working on Strawberry AI model, WiMi starts its innovation in AI application","According to media reports, OpenAI is working on a new AI model, code-named Strawberry.

OpenAI New large models are being developed

The model’s operation is also kept strictly confidential within the OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said. The internal document describes a project that uses the Strawberry model that allows the company’s AI not only to answer questions, but also to plan in advance and browse the Internet reliably to do “in-depth research” described by OpenAI.

Details of the project have not been reported, but OpenAI hopes the innovation will greatly improve the reasoning capabilities of its AI models, adding that Strawberry involves a specialized approach to pre-training and postprocessing AI models on very large datasets.

In February this year, OpenAI released a new video model Sora, first opening the ChatGPT moment of AI video generation; on May 13, OpenAI just launched a new model GPT-4o, the new model is not only free, but also has the ability to listen, watch and speak, can real-time smooth video call, without delay response, consistent with human dialogue response speed.

OpenAI Fully demonstrated the application of GPT-4o in real-time translation, visual recognition and other aspects, and conducted a dialogue demonstration between two ChatGPT models, showing its end-to-end trained neural network ability to process speech, text and images, indicating that the application of AI technology in daily life will be more extensive and in-depth.

It seems that there have been more moves inside OpenAI, as executive Sam Altman revealed the direction of GPT-5 in a previous interview, suggesting that it will have a “virtual brain” function to help users deal with various tasks. In addition, he mentioned the construction plan of the AI chip plant and his views on AGI (artificial general intelligence), arguing that AGI will greatly improve work efficiency.

Overall, this news is exciting, the development of OpenAI’s new AI model and the improvement of reasoning capabilities have a broad and far-reaching impact, and it will continue to drive the overall technical level of the industry. It deserves the high attention and expectation of the industry and the whole world.



WiMi exploration large model application opportunity

At present, the AI model track has spawned one new technological achievement after another under the high attention of the world. At the same time, domestic and foreign AI entrepreneurs are also active. According to the data, the head manufacturer artificial intelligence enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) firmly continue to bet on the theory + practice innovation research direction, adhere to the independent research and development of artificial intelligence multi-modal brain-computer interface technology has realized the implementation of products and technologies, break through the traditional model, the effect is very significant.

So far, WiMi in artificial intelligence industry to realize independent innovation and breakthrough of the critical moment, in some view is to seize the opportunity, in-depth research and development of multimodal large model innovation, also includes the text, video, audio reasoning ability, and the application of low delay, shows the lead in AI technology application and commercialization and future growth potential, promote the orderly development of large model technology application.

AI and large models are leading the new market direction, and major manufacturers are aiming at generative AI and actively exploring multi-modal large models, in order to take the lead in the competition. Just like the fierce competition in the above areas, WiMi is launching generative AI rich application scenarios according to the characteristics of the industry, actively promoting the application and popularization of large model technology, and providing digital transformation infrastructure support for the advantages of big data and cloud computing. In the future, WiMi is expected to boost an industry change and seize more market share.

To sum up

In fact, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are also trying different technologies to improve the reasoning ability of AI models, as do most academic laboratories that do AI research. In the next stage of the big model, the competition will only intensify. If participants want not to be pushed down the “card table”, continue to maintain advantages in the subsequent competition, and achieve breakthrough, in addition to rolling technology, they must also strive to improve their own “moat”, especially in the level of application scenarios, they need to increase technology research and development to provide escort.",1721629786,829706,No_Truth_2706,t2_zs5zwl0yo,8381975fa48c6596273506024544e49a3f2407a7d5fc558dab55093f32e80361,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1e97eab/openai_is_working_on_strawberry_ai_model_wimi/

2461,$IFUS Impact Fusion International Inc. (OTC Pink: IFUS) Makes Significant Strides in Bagasse Utilization and SGP+™ Validation ,"Impact Fusion International Inc. OTC Pink: IFUS On May 28, 2024, bipartisan legislation (LA HCR-42) passed with overwhelming support in both the Louisiana House (99 Yeas, 0 Nays) and Senate (31 Yeas, 0 Nays). This legislation focuses on the utilization of bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, following testimony from Dr. Clyde (Pat) Bagley and Agricultural Commissioner, Dr. Michael Strain.

For more details on the resolution, check it out here: \[LA HCR42 | 2024 | Regular Session | LegiScan\]([https://www.legiscan.com/LA/bill/HCR42/2024](https://www.legiscan.com/LA/bill/HCR42/2024))

Here are some key highlights from the recent developments:

\*\*Collaboration with Experts\*\*:

* In September 2023, IFUS met with Dr. Strain in Baton Rouge, LA, where he provided guidance on validating SGP+™ as a supplement, partial feed, and potentially a hay replacement for beef and dairy cattle.
* Following Dr. Strain's advice, IFUS partnered with the American Sugarcane League, local U.S.D.A. representatives, and the Farm Bureau Federation to advance their research and development.

\*\*Scientific Validation and Partnerships\*\*:

* IFUS partnered with the Southern University Agricultural and Research Center (SUAREC) in Baton Rouge, LA.
* SUAREC team members were impressed by the transformation of bagasse into SGP+™, leading Dr. Bagley to call it the ""Holy Grail"" of energy and nutrition for cattle.
* Dr. Bagley is investigating whether SGP+™ can serve as a hay replacement due to its potential to break down lignin, previously thought indigestible.

2465,Insider buying (MBIO) Mustang Bio!,"🔥 As quietly revealed on Page 13 in Friday evening's (Form S-1 / Preliminary Prospectus) SEC filing, New York City based hedge fund Armistice Capital now owns 59,351,150 shares of Mustang Bio's common stock...an ownership stake of well over 57% in MBIO! *This massive number includes both registered/unregistered stock & warrants. If all of them are exercised in the future, the hedge fund will own a CONTROLLING stake of the company (and in a shadowy way they already do). Their quiet accumulation (while avoiding Schedule 13D filings) speaks volume and is not by mistake! History says that it's often wise to mimic the moves of Insiders.

The July 19th SEC filing also finally identified Armistice Capital as the mysterious late June accredited/Institutional buyer of the stock & warrants (at-the-market) offering, which closed less than 24-hrs later at 41 cents per share...a 220% premium from where MBIO traded at just a few days earlier pre-news! Friday's form S-1 filing is ""not yet"" an official registered offering of shares, see the red print at the bottom of Page 1 for details. Should this draft version become official in the future, Armistice Capital would still own 53,221,150 common shares -- 89.7% of their original stake in Mustang Bio! This is likely a good time & opportunity to open a long position in MBIO. 🔥",1721666016,829714,PhaseP38,t2_badaylyjl,44ada60b0c75dd31bbdf9d24141f315e087b00557d30c3d6983482df643bf29a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1e9iotr/insider_buying_mbio_mustang_bio/

Over time SkySats will be replenished with Planet’s next-generation high-resolution fleet, Pelican, which is designed to further increase revisit rates and image resolution, while also reducing latency and speeding customer time to insights. The first Pelican tech demo, launched in November 2023, continues to perform well.

""The ability to enable considerably faster alerting of various types of events around the world has the potential to unlock entirely new use cases for customers,"" Will Marshall added.

Additionally, last month Planet announced that it is collaborating with NVIDIA on its onboard processing capabilities for its high-resolution Pelican-2 satellite. Through this collaboration, Planet will leverage the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform for its next-generation high-resolution mission and fly the technology on its Pelican-2 satellite, set to launch later this year. Leveraging recent advances in AI, Planet expects this collaboration to support shorter time to value for customers across government and commercial markets.

2474,Royal Helium Ltd. Achieves Key Milestones in Helium Production and Gears Up for More Exploration,"Helium is an essential element used across various industries, including welding, diving, aerospace, nuclear power, and electronics manufacturing. Despite its critical role, the production of helium faces significant challenges due to its limited availability and depleting reservoirs. Historically, the United States was a major producer, but its reserves have dwindled, creating a supply shortage.

Source: https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2024/05/14/what-is-helium-and-why-is-it-critical-to-have-enough-of-the-gas/73621159007/

Royal Helium Ltd. (Ticker: RHC.v or RHCCF for US investors), a Canadian company focused on helium production, infrastructure, and exploration, is addressing these supply challenges head-on. With a broad portfolio of potential helium permits and leases in southern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, Royal Helium aims to become a leading producer of this indispensable non-renewable resource in North America.

https://preview.redd.it/sbi4mwtjt5ed1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ef970821a662199c8762bd1fcded970de1036b3

Since beginning operations in November 2023, Royal Helium's Steveville helium purification plant has completed its 12th and 13th trailer sales. CEO Andrew Davidson highlighted the plant's stable production, automation capabilities, and self-powering design, which together ensure positive cash flow with minimal expenses. 

The facility processes 15,000 mcf/day of raw gas from two wells, producing 22,000 mcf of 99.999% pure helium annually. Additionally, the plant benefits from Alberta's carbon credits and has a projected 25-year lifespan, also producing commercial carbon dioxide. Royal Helium has contracted Progress Through Technology (PTT) to optimize production further.

Expanding its operations, Royal Helium has licensed and permitted the Forty Mile #1 exploratory helium well at the Forty Mile project in southeastern Alberta. This project spans 7,000 acres, acquired through a seismic review option agreement with an independent private vendor, and includes a historic well that has shown promising results. The initial well's results are comparable to the best Cambrian helium discovery wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana.

Royal Helium has completed seismic work at Forty Mile and identified multiple drill targets across various prospective horizons. The primary target horizons for the Forty Mile #1 well are Devonian and Cambrian, drilled into the Precambrian crystalline basement. The well will target multiple zones, and if successful, the company plans to fully develop the Forty Mile project based on the identified drill targets.

Royal Helium Ltd. continues to advance in the helium industry, leveraging its strategic locations, advanced facilities, and robust exploration projects to meet the increasing global demand for this vital resource.

2480,World Copper Ltd ($WCU): Capitalizing on the Copper Boom for EVs and Renewable Energy,"**World Copper Ltd. (WCU: TSXV)** is in position to benefit from the growing demand for copper worldwide.

Both the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors heavily rely on copper, and World Copper is well-prepared to meet this demand with an impressive portfolio of copper oxide mining projects.

The company’s standout assets, the Zonia Project in Arizona and the Escalones Project in Chile, form the cornerstone of their extensive mineral portfolio, positioning World Copper as a key player in the market

# Zonia Project

The Zonia Project is pivotal to World Copper’s supply.  This project offers robust financial prospects, boasting an after-tax NPV of $447 million and an IRR of 29% at a copper price of $4.00 per pound. Zonia's strategic location and economic viability make it a cornerstone asset, ensuring sustainable growth and significant returns. Its development aligns with World Copper’s mission to supply the increasing demand for copper in renewable energy and electric vehicles. Furthermore, the proximity to Phoenix makes the project a hotbed for employment opportunities.

# Escalones Project

Located in Chile, Escalones is one of the largest emerging copper oxide deposits in the Western Hemisphere, significantly contributing to World Copper’s strategic initiative. Unlike Zonia, Escalones offers immense untapped potential with ongoing development that promises substantial future output. This project positions World Copper to leverage Chile's rich mineral resources and favorable mining environment. Escalones is crucial for the company’s long-term growth strategy, enabling it to meet rising copper demand from the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors while diversifying its asset base.

*Other Important Highlights:* 

1. **Market Demand:** Copper is critical for future technologies, with a projected supply deficit of 22 billion pounds per year by 2035. World Copper stands to gain from rising prices amid the surge in demand for years to come.
2. **Sustainable Practices:** The use of the SX-EW process in copper extraction minimizes environmental impact and aligns with global sustainability trends.
3. **Experienced Team:** Led by seasoned professionals like Derek White and Myron Smith, the management team brings extensive expertise in mine development and regulatory navigation.

I believe there’s growth to be found as well as favorable upside potential for World Copper. As the world continues to look to reduce environmental damage with growing renewable energy practices and increased EV production, the rise may be forthcoming for $WCU

2493,Nations Royalty: (NRC.v) A New Majority Indigenous-Owned Royalty Company with Assets in BC’s Golden Triangle with (Net Asset Value of $214M),"*“Royalty companies have been the crown jewel of the mining space over the past two decades; we have the first-mover advantage and look forward to creating significant value for all investors in Nations Royalty""*

Nations Royalty Corp (TSXV: NRC) is looking to transform how First Nations groups can capitalize on their resource-related royalties, representing a unique and untapped segment in the royalty space.

NRC is dedicated to enabling First Nations and Indigenous communities to monetize their entitlements from various resource projects. These include royalties, income streams, and annual benefit payments secured through Benefit Agreements. This novel approach not only provides a financial avenue for these communities but also strengthens their involvement in the resource sector.

The company's initial portfolio is comprised of five key royalties under four agreements, all located within British Columbia’s resource-rich Golden Triangle. The assets include:

* *Brucejack Mine:* An operational copper-silver underground mine managed by Pretium Resource.
* *Premier Gold Project:* Overseen by Ascot Resources, this project has recently commenced gold production, with commercial production slated for Q3 2024.
* *Red Mountain Gold:* Another Ascot Resources project, positioned near the Premier Mine.
* *KSM:* A developing project by SeaBridge Gold, offering exposure to copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum.
* *Kitsault:* A fully permitted brownfield site for molybdenum advancement, operated by New Moly LLC.

Collectively, these assets hold a net asset value estimated at approximately USD 214 million. Revenue projections are promising, with expectations of USD 4 million in 2024, growing to USD 52 million by 2032 based on current assets and projected production timelines.

The Nisga’a Nation is a significant stakeholder, owning around 76.8% of Nations Royalty through their holdings of 111.1 million common shares. This majority position allows the Nisga’a Nation to nominate four board members, ensuring their substantial influence over the company's strategic direction. 

Other notable shareholders include Frank Giustra, a prominent figure in the mining industry and founder of the entity that evolved into Goldcorp, and Wheaton Precious Metals, through its Fiore Group, holding a 15.6% interest. Both major shareholders are subject to a three-year escrow agreement.

Nations Royalty Corp is poised to make a significant impact in the mining and royalty sectors, offering a pioneering model for First Nations' economic participation in resource development.

2501,Dear Illuminati - WTF - You know as well as we do that Tesla is overvalued - Elon is no Tony Stark - The Tech is NOWHERE NEAR READY,"How does the market TANK because of Tesla? Are you kidding me. Real quick. To Bank of America and all the other high-end financial institutions giving cover to a Mega-Cap that has a forward PE 1000 x higher than an ocean skimming Southwest airlines flight; YOU are enabling this. This isn't capitalism, this is cronyism.

It's like a financial cult cabal based on one man's hopium that him alone can only build vehicles and technology of the future. This is a patent falsehood being perpetuated by people that have no clue what technology is or how it works. Name in point. Cathie MF Wood.

Just think about the $56 Billion dollars. The judicial system gave these people a way out and defended them against their own worst judgment and the shareholders went back in and doubled down on the pay package.

Does one not realize how much R&D $56 Billion dollars could afford? And that's straight cash.

And where are the consumer agencies? You're telling me that we have defined 5 levels of autonomous driving that was put together and defined in part because years ago Elon was hijacking the phrase ""Self-Driving"". Still doubling down, because nobody gives shit about fuck, Elon now markets it as ""FULL-Self-Driving"". Which in actual reality it is level 2 self-driving. Where and how and when does the word ""FULL"" come into anyones lexicon let alone consumer marketing?

Look at the numbers if you don't believe me.

* Uber has a market cap of: $**140.58 Billion USD**
* Lyft has a market cap of: **$5.03 Billion USD**
* The rest of the US taxi market is roughly a market cap of: **$21.34 Billion USD**

If you look at the above TAM that equates to roughly $167 Billion USD. If a hypothetical Robotaxi company took 100% of the market it still wouldn't surmount to Tesla's current eval, future eval/earnings, and certainly not anything that cult leader Cathie Prathiagrus Wood's is insanely suggesting.

There is a simple reason of why all of this is so crazy as well. Gross margins. Margins on a car are about 3.9% of the final car price. Yes, if you make your car into an Iphone you will get some additional verticals there that have much better profit margins than a vehicle. This is the rub. For Tesla, the additional squeeze is this grand idea that cars can drive themselves. Here's the thing, they can't.

No matter how much you butter up and put lipstick on that pig the reality is we are nowhere near self-driving cars in the next 10 years. The interesting part about it is that the technology needed to truly create self-driving level 5 autonomous driving is not even being developed in large part by Tesla. It is being built by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic.

The idea, that you can brute force every road, stop sign, and traffic signal in the US with a bunch of If / Else statements and make a scalably viable autonomous level 3, 4, or 5 driving system is absurdity. There is no AI/ML pattern systems that will work efficiently enough to make this a viable platform. Let me make it more clear, FSD in its current state could be on version 87 and it would still not pass a level 2 system.

The technological inadequacy here is clear. Generative AI based on worldview environments with live real-time reactions would be the technology you need to break out of level 2 autonomous driving.

Now Mr. Musk is a smart guy and I would say that he is probably a genius - he's just not very forthright. He damn well knows this and the reason why he is putting the bank into capex for new Nvidia chips for the Tesla supercomputer is because he is now planning on going down a road of competing with OpenAI directly.

And that's fine, I truly believe that in the next 5 years we are going to see tech like nothing the world has ever seen. But picks and shovels are going to be sold. Meaning, these technologies will be purchased by GM, FORD, Volkswagens and other car manufacturers. The idea that Elon Musk is somehow going to own all of that is absurd.

The tech that Elon Musk needs and wants is 5 - 10 years away. Full stop. In all that time other players and other competitors will be getting ready as well. Flying taxis from Archer makes more sense to me then wanting to catch a car with no driver to put my bags in the trunk. I love tipping that man or woman doing that job. What is the appeal or necessity of a driverless car doing the same work? If a robot was in the car driving it and talking to me I would appreciate that and think it's cute but I am not going to hope over Carlos or Jenny when I know they have a family to feed at home.

That notion of using AI without care of human impact on job function loss will probably take generations to get out of the human psyche. Meaning, I won't use the self-checkout for this exact reason. 1. I don't want to bag my own shit, 2. I know this lady doing this at the register has a family. 2 - 5 items meh.

It's not that Tesla isn't worth Billions or Elon isn't a smart guy. It's the PE and forward PE doesn't make sense. Great company, just not at this value. The tech will eventually get here but you can't buy the tech company Tesla on hopium when it may not be them who truly pushes this technology forward and into a practical/scalable state.",1721842290,829784,Xtianus21,t2_58rkqicv,477e897493fd3edf5b2c1818885329f91acd28e7ca655114d9ed3f72d1f91fb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eb7c8l/dear_illuminati_wtf_you_know_as_well_as_we_do/

2503,"SPY Drops -2% for the First Time in 356 Days… 7-24-24 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ/ NQ Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis","This market always surprises us and I have to say the fact that today is just a random Wednesday and we are seeing one of the biggest red days the markets have seen in well over a year is quite impressive. Honestly I am a bit surprised because truly earnings were not that bad and there isn’t really any other data catalysts. However, what there is that may be leading this (and also started this correction) is the fact that the soft landing narrative is all but gone now… markets are bracing for the hard landing and for rate cuts… not because the economy is strong but because the fed went too far…

Tomorrow is an incredibly important day for this market… in the past two years the market has almost always immediately bounced back on days of massive dropping like this… however, if the tides have officially turned we very well could be looking at the start of further downside.

https://preview.redd.it/jv94q4aixied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec0c1619374ae8d020addc5c4539c0fd5d4c1961

While the fact that we have not CLOSED a -2% day on SPY in over 356 trading days is impressive… I think what is even more intriguing to me is the fact that since 0dte everyday on SPY and QQQ has started the market has never seen a -2% close… there has been for quite a long time now talk that the 0dte market with all the gamma and greeks will not allow it. Tomorrow is going to be interesting from a technical perspective.

Imagine we go from no -2% red days on SPY in 356 trading days to back to back -2% red days…

 

https://preview.redd.it/e45jaszixied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc520b5fb095b9986b86d7183753085156e9f32c

Now while a lot of people obviously love their bear days and shorting this market… I don’t think it is time to just jump full on in bearish… if you look at the chart above on average the market does see one 10% correction PER YEAR… and on average see three 5% corrections per year… Now from our ATH at 565.16 on SPY a 3% correction is at 548.16, a 5% correction sits at 536.9 and a 10% correction sits at 508.6.

Now while we do get one 10% correction per year on average (since 1928) we do not generally see a 15% correction (which would be SPY hitting 480.38) but one every 2 years and we only see a true bear market (20% dip from ATH to low… 452.1) but once every 3.5 years… I would say while I certainly think a 5-10% correction is plausible here I am not quite sure we are ready for a full on capitulation -15 to -20% correction. However, the first rate cut which historically is incredibly bearish certainly could bring that drop….

https://preview.redd.it/3hfodebjxied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6849af10bd4cead12635fd76793c8e5ba5d0728

Market is in a pretty sensitive spot right now… I suspect if we see GDP come in lower than expect and previous we could see a very strong continuation to the downside tomorrow. The market is losing hope and faith in the fed and their soft landing narrative.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/we25t63kxied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fcb1506c76ef32c1bff5ed639c16ad88596091f

On SPY we have now seen 5 straight days of stronger daily sellers, something we have not seen since the middle of April when we had 6 stronger days of selling. Something else that we have not seen since the end of April/ beginning of May is a touch of the daily 50ema support.

This daily double top doji rejection we had yesterday off 554.7 formed a new supply today too. This lead to not only a drop below our previous demand of 548.93 but we completely gapped down below that level. With this major gap down here we are in some pretty bearish territory.

The 541.39 to 545.23 is a major triple demand/ support area that bulls need to defend. If the bulls fail to defend this level we very well could be looking at an even stronger breakdown to the daily 100ema support area near 528. We also have our next demand/ support target at 533.59.

Bulls are not in control until we retake the 8/ 20ema which will officially bearishly cross under for the first time since beginning of May. To further hurt the bulls… we are actually nearing extreme daily BEAR momentum…

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 530.36 -> 531.39 -> 536.92 -> 554.7 -> 564.94  
Demand- 533.59 -> 541.39 -> 543.66 -> 545.23 -> 548.93 -> 561.58

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/5pocuwfkxied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a0148d2a518421a0accaf3168f622bb1c10b82

If it wasn’t for the wick on this ES candle we would have a VERY rare intraweek gap down on the daily candle. Very rarely and occasionally we will see a opening week gap up or gap down but very rarely (usually only earnings season) do we ever have a chance for a gap up or gap down intraweek like this.

We have had a major breakdown through previous double demand supports of 5532-5552. Not only that but we completely rejected and turned the daily 8/20ema into resistance which will bearishly cross under tomorrow. The daily 50ema support on ES is a natural spot to expect a bounce. I would generally not be surprised to see a bit of a inside day tomorrow or a double bottom to take us back up into that 5532-5552 resistance area. However, if this truly is markets turning point/ capitulation we could be looking at a major downside continuation tomorrow.

Our next major downside targets are the supply/ demand at 5325-5353 which is also where the daily 100ema support will sit. Markets have not touched the daily 100ema support since April 19^(th).

Bulls again need to minimally retake 8/20ema resistance near 5585 to be back in control.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5610 -> 5716  
Demand- 5353 -> 5436 -> 5532 -> 5552 -> 5639

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/pt9zz6tkxied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f025caf4889d74f49ada6376fa0faa77119a2e

In one swift move here QQQ has brought back in daily sellers, confirmed the daily 8/20ema as resistance, crossed under the EMAs and also confirmed the daily 50ema as resistance. Truly such an incredible move to the downside here… we had such an incredibly strong support area from 471.93-475.29 that has officially broken. With the daily 50ema and this double demand support breaking the flood gates are open.

This new supply at 482.4 now gives us a target of 459.82 which is our supply. Below that we seek out a retest of the daily 100ema support near 457. We have not seen the 100ema touched since the first week of May. Below this we have previous demands/ support at 442-450.65 to watch.

Bulls much like on SPY and ES need to retake the crossed under EMAs at 482.4 to be back in control.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 441.14 -> 459.82 -> 482.4 -> 502.99  
Demand- 442 -> 450.65 -> 471.93 -> 475.29 -> 497.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

Nq also brough back in stronger daily sellers today with its new supply at 19986. We almost go the gap down on NQ today too if it was not for the wick yesterday. I am a bit surprised that yesterdays doji played out one of the nastiest and biggest evening doji start reversals that I have seen in a very very long time.

On NQ it appears that we are set to touch our daily 100ema support which also perfectly coincides with our next supply and target of 18953. Below this we will have a pretty strong demand and support area of 18234-18594 to watch.

Bulls need to retake 19986 to be back in control again.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 18953 -> 19986 -> 20897  
Demand- 18234 -> 18594 -> 19592 -> 19697

**VIX DAILY**

Everyone always gives me a hard time saying you cant TA the VIX and that you certainly cant use supply and Demand on the VIX… well today proves that wrong… I mentioned two days ago that when VIX rejected and made its new supply at 16.53 that if we were to get a hard bounce off the daily 8 ema support that we could see a bear flag play out on the markets. The markets 100% played out the most perfect failed recovery and bear flag today with the support of the VIX to drive it lower. Actually today was very important to note that physical selling was NOT the primary driver of this market going lower… most of the day 15min sellers were NOT stronger… but rather the VIX just continued to push higher and higher… what does this tell us? Fear is rising… and not short term fear but rather fear into the EOY… now that could be related to the election (lets not get political but also we can recognize it is a concern for man) or it could like I mentioned (and this is my general thoughts) be the fact that the market is scared we are going to get a hard landing that starts at the next fed meeting in September.

If you read my post last Thursday you will know that I was eyeing a MAJOR cup and handle breakout on the VIX… this would correlate with the normal 79% VIX spike when the market has a correction. With this assumingly playing out here we have potential to see SPY drop about another $10 into the 531-532 support area.

https://preview.redd.it/t0l7n44mxied1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cb534d3754f3ec200980f6d05420ae3add9e8e3

As you can see not only are we majorly breaking breaking out of almost 3 months long of consolidation but we also turned previous range resistance into demand/ support at 14.7 today. Which led us to breakout over the 16.53 level that dates back to April and now we begin to target the 18.25 supply area from the April highs and last correction in this market.

If we see the VIX push and breakout over 18.25 I generally feel confident that the triple supply/ resistance area of 21.29-22.67 will not only be retested but we will see SPY get its 10% correction. It is no coincidence that we stopped at the daily 50ema support on ES and the daily supply of 18.25 on the VIX…

Today was the largest push up on the VIX since April 22^(nd) and April 26^(th) where the VIX rose 24% in one day. The only larger single day spike on the VIX was November 26^(th) 2021 where the VIX rose 54% in one day… we all know what happened after November 2021…

I am always up front and honest with you guys about my wins and loses… today much like Monday almost got away from me. I was as you can see 100% long biased this morning… I truly just didn’t understand this drop and I didn’t even until we started to see stronger daily sellers and VIX continue to rally see a technical reason to be so bearish. I certainly didn’t have a nearly 110pt ES and almost 700pt NQ drop on my bingo card for today… and that long bias did hurt me.

I found back though from basically a few dollars away from losing all three accounts to fighting back to a small loss on all three accounts. I have never felt like a red day was a “Win” as much as I have today.

Definitely going to take it easy tomorrow and Friday… one big thing that REALLY has killed me both Monday (in shorts) and today (in longs) was that basically every single play I entered we would instantly move 10-15 pts in my direction… but of course due to volatility we wouldn’t continue direction but reverse 30-40 pts then push back 50 pts my direction… this has caused me to watch almost every single loss I had go from green to red. Definitely brutal trading in this type of volatility… much quicker profit taking needs to be had and much more careful entries need to be had too.",1721851866,829788,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,8ae9d3628a84871fc98f5beb212d9aec691bd227231b5e3374b0e64efaf7cd50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ebba8s/spy_drops_2_for_the_first_time_in_356_days_72424/

2506,"Vior Inc. (VIO.v), its Belleterre Gold Project & $22 Million Cash Position Against $37 Million Market Cap","Vior Inc. (Ticker: VIO.v or VIORF for US investors), a junior mining exploration company based in Quebec, Canada, boasts over 35 years of exploration success. The company’s strategic focus and experienced management team position it as a promising player in the mining sector.

**Strategic Location and Exploration Potential**

Vior’s operations span two of the most favorable mining jurisdictions in North America: Quebec and Nevada. These regions are known for their rich deposits of precious and critical metals, offering an advantageous setting for mining activities. The Belleterre project is particularly notable for its underexplored status over the past 60 years, now seeing unprecedented consolidation and exploration efforts.

**Financial Strength and Valuation**

Vior’s financial health is robust, bolstered by a recent capital raise of $21.83 million, bringing its cash position close to $22 million. This strong treasury supports the company’s valuation of $37 million, indicating a well-capitalized and low-risk investment. Major shareholders, including Osisko Mining, which owns nearly 25% of Vior, underscore the strong institutional confidence in the company’s prospects.

**Management and Partnerships**

The management team at Vior brings over a century of combined industry experience and holds more than 14% equity in the company. This high level of insider ownership aligns management’s interests with those of the shareholders, fostering a commitment to value creation and exploration success. Vior’s strategic partnerships with entities such as Osisko Mining, FTQ, SIDEX, and others provide substantial financial and technical support, enhancing the company's exploration capabilities and project execution.

**Flagship Project: Belleterre Gold**

Vior’s primary asset is the flagship Belleterre Gold Project, a district-scale exploration initiative encompassing 572 square kilometers in Quebec's Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. This project hosts the historic Belleterre Gold Mine, which produced approximately 800,000 ounces of gold at an impressive grade of 10.7 g/t between 1936 and 1959. 

https://preview.redd.it/9k0rugnl3ked1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceabe0b56f43eb5264a93f7aedece80102a571f0

With extensive high-grade gold showings and a fully funded 60,000-meter drill program set to commence in summer/fall 2024, the Belleterre project is poised for significant exploration and discovery potential.

**Exploration and Future Prospects**

The Belleterre project’s geology presents diverse mineralization potential, including high-grade gold veins, exhalative Cu-Zn-Au-Ag deposits, and lithium-bearing pegmatite dykes. The extensive land package covers a majority of the Belleterre volcano-sedimentary belt, promising further discoveries and resource expansion. The project's strategic location, adjacent to the advanced Tansim Lithium Project, adds another layer of value with potential lithium exploration opportunities.

Vior’s immediate focus is on the Belleterre project, with an ongoing detailed data compilation and 3D geological modeling guiding the high-priority drill targeting program. The upcoming 60,000-meter drill program aims to unlock the significant untapped potential of this historic mining district.

2512,Am I screwed!?,"

Hey, throwaway account here… Don't care if y'all downvote or call BS, just need some advice.

So, I'm super obsessed with trying to cheating the stock market (I know, bad idea). Always looking for new ways to rake in the dough. Recently, with all the AI breakthroughs, I got my hands on this AI stock analyst tool that's still in beta. Me and my buddy have been testing it out. It's like having a crystal ball for the markets, and I got really good at using it. My trades went from being a coin flip (50-50) to nailing almost every single one. I'm talking serious gains, no more eating ramen every night!

Here's the thing: My dad got busted in the 80s for insider trading. He had this buddy who was a geologist in the gold industry. They had this whole scheme where they could predict gold prices with insider info. Long story short, he got caught, and it was a mess. That paranoia rubbed off on me big time.

So now, I'm sitting here thinking, is my AI edge gonna get me in hot water? This AI is insane. When I ask it questions, it web-browses like crazy, even dips into some deep web data. It predicts prices using technical analysis that's way beyond the capability of any human. It crunches through moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci retracements, and even Elliott Waves in seconds. The level of precision is nuts. It’s almost like having an unfair advantage.

For context, I'm trading options, mainly calls and puts. Been leveraging some pretty risky strategies like iron condors and butterfly spreads, but this AI makes it feel like child's play. Is this just too good to be true? Should I be worried about my brokerage accounts flagging my account or something??

Any advice from seasoned traders would be awesome. Am I overthinking this, or should I dial it back? Thanks, and sorry if this sounds dumb.

2536,"Is There More To Go On This Correction? 7-26-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","I have got to say the last two weeks have been the biggest drop since April on the market. I am very curious what next week will bring for us as we have more earnings and we have more data to watch also.

We have a lot to unpack here so lets get right into it!



https://preview.redd.it/22yhr0rd6xed1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b079fc7358e2a4f0dd0a648e6d46d2263b3c25f2

This is a MASSIVELY heavy data week next week.. we also have the incredibly important FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Now in my opinion this week of data is even more important because we are seeing some true weakness in this market and I also believe we are starting to see the market roll over related to idea of a hard landing. Throughout the last year the markets been rallying realistically on the thought that even though we were going to get rate cuts that we were going to get a “soft landing.” This would be essentially a strong economy, inflation coming down and rate cuts. However, with the unemployment rate rising and now inflation coming down (and the help of lack luster earnings from Google) the market is starting to fear that a true hard landing (worse case scenario) is coming. I expect some fairly impressive and big moves from all of this data this week. 

https://preview.redd.it/yvoxwpme6xed1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd80623902c81ac1ebbb9bd83b188f85acb97ed

As of right now markets have the highest probability at 95.3% that we will NOT get a rate cut at this meeting. The market is pretty convinced however with 87.7% odds that we will get a rate cut in September… that essentially gives the current 3% CPI YoY time to come down closer to that 2% target which “gives the fed confidence in cutting” or so JPOW says… Even more importantly is that JPOW and plenty of the fed has said that they will cut before we get to 2%...

Now bearing any major pump in CPI YoY in the next two months I honestly think if the CPI YoY can end up near 2.5% or lower we will indeed get that rate cut. This is where if we continue to see the economy weaken and unemployment rate rise next week with our data that we are going to see the market start to brace even more for a hard landing.

https://preview.redd.it/p6cv3e0f6xed1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1410f08ac64e55ccd35972921ca2a68e9fb118b0

Not only do we have MAJOR economic data for this market to worry about, not only do we have FOMC and JPOW next week on Wednesday, but we also get some MAJOR heavy hitter earnings. If Google is any sort of indication of the earnings to come and the more important reaction to come we could see a very red and bloody weak… in the past we have seen earning save the market and prevent some pretty major moves to the downside… however, with the reaction to Google I would honestly not be surprised to see a big red move down after Monday.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/63e4cobf6xed1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0b0b012e50437ef92474d785ed7c5c4d223568b

We have A LOT to unpack here on the weekly timeframe… for both SPY/ ES and QQQ/ NQ I am going to show a much bigger zoomed out weekly chart on SPY/ QQQ and a more zoomed in normal weekly chart on ES/ NQ.

Here on SPY after an imbalanced close three weeks ago we rebalanced last week. Now I did for the most part expect that we should hold weekly 8ema support and more importantly hold 543.87 support. While we did get a pretty hard bounce there the most important thing to note here is that not only did we break the major weekly rising wedge dating back to before April but we also broke the yellow bull channel. This yellow bull channel actually dates all the way back to September 2023.

This from a technical stand point is a pretty major and important break of trend. We have the weakest weekly buyers on SPY since the first week in May also. The extreme weekly bull momentum which we were using as a backbone to go higher is officially broken now too.

We are likely setting up for a retest of the weekly 20ema support near 529.31. We have only touched the weekly 20ema support three times since November 2023. We have not CLOSED below the weekly 20ema support since October 2023. IF we close under the weekly 20ema for the first time in almost a year I would start to look for a bigger drop down to the weekly 50ema support near 500 (by time we get there).

However, IF the bulls can defend the weekly 20ema support next week and hold that level at close then this is the ultimate dip buying opportunity. If the last two times we have touched the weekly 20ema support is an indication of what is to come we could see almost a 20% rally (per the average) over the next 3-6 months (per the average) before we see another major correction (like Aprils and this one). That would be a rally to roughly the 630s before EOY.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 523.21 -> 554.7  
Demand- 494.86 -> 543.87

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/m1olrinf6xed1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf9e0bf64bc54215d84871f5aa9e2079eb937fe1

Like I said here on ES I am going to have a more zoomed in approach so you can see a little closer to where we are candle wise and how important these moves are. On ES you can see not only was the red weekly rising wedge support broken last week but we too have officially broken our yellow almost year long bull channel support too… again from a technical stand point this is pretty major and could have a major technical downside move.

With a major hit to weekly buyers this week and the loss of extreme weekly bull momentum there is no long a crutch for upside movement for the bulls. I believe the last two days of afternoon dumps have been a great testament to that.

From here if the bears are going to be in control we need to seek a move to the weekly 20ema support near 5345. We also have a target of the weekly supply at 5307 to watch.

Now for bulls again we must defend the weekly 20ema support of 5345. That could set up a move back to the weekly supply of 5614.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5307 -> 5614  
Demand- 5000

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/uozqkyzf6xed1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f991482c3362ba597258ff813a315dd4e53f398

Looking at QQQ here we have a major break in the bullishness that we have been seeing. Now there is a bit of a difference here on QQQ compared to SPY. While we did break a pretty aggressive yellow bull channel we have been in since April (the last correction) we have not broken the red weekly bull channel that dates back to August 2022 (yes you read that right 2022!!!). We do however, have the first weekly SELLERS on QQQ since April 2024. With a loss of the weekly 8ema support we are now in a fight for the weekly 20ema support. If we break through the weekly 20ema support then it should be a pretty big downside move to the weekly 50ema support. If you notice the green weekly 50ema support line almost perfectly correlates with the red weekly bull channel support line. We have not touched that line since October 2023 (the last time we had a low in this market).

In general based on the trend of this red bull channel… IF we touch that support which will be near 424 area… that could if it holds result in an almost 50% rally (on average) over about 9 months (on average). That would take QQQ to about the 630 area by the spring of 2025…

Now with that being said… if that support fails in this channel realistically the most major support to watch would be 345.29 which is the support from the October low before the currently rally. 414.4 is also a notable support area from April to watch.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 408.58 -> 496.33  
Demand- 414.4 -> 450.77 -> 477.71

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/6bvrwbdg6xed1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6a8c6d0b77498df12aecdf7c34b19b79485b3d

As I said here is a more zoomed in trend here for you to see and more easily read where the next week might take us. As you can see we broke the yellow bull channel that dates back to April, however we are holding that TWO YEAR long bull channel support (Red line).

With the loss and now turning the weekly 8ema into resistance we targeted a move to the weekly 20ema support. This is essentially bulls last stand. If the bulls can not defend this weekly 20ema support and more importantly the weekly demand at 18558 we are very likely headed to the weekly 50ema support and demand near 17176. This is also exactly the area the two year long bull channel support sits in.

Now if we defend this weekly 20ema support and prevent a sell off to the weekly 50ema I generally would expect a move back to the weekly demand of 19955 which would confirm the next major leg up is coming. I do depending on FOMC Wednesday and earnings this week could for sure see a major rally into the September meeting and potentially into the EOY. Historically the “crash” when rates cuts happen usually starts after the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) rate cut not the first.

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 16957 -> 20588  
Demand- 17176 -> 18558 -> 19955

What a whirlwind and whipsaw of a week! Honestly looking back I do think I could have played this week better. However, in the momentum I think I played the week the best I could. The biggest thing that killed me this week was a total lack of continuation. IT honestly wasn’t that my targets didn’t hit… its that volatility was so high with the VIX near 18 that I would see instant profits, hit a massive wick to stop me out at a full loss before it reversed completely to my initial profit target. Very hard to deal with that.

I lost my funded accounts yesterday. But was able to fight back and get three new evals today passed. I only got one funded re-activated today for some reason (it takes 1-2 business days they say) so I only traded that one… now I changed things up a lot today.. I didn’t trade full size… I was trading two ES with a 5pt stop loss and 1 NQ with a 20pt stop loss… the issue all week was basically I was instantly being stopped out from volatility and never got to see a win.

Today sizing down I was able to double my stop loss for the same risk. This also allowed me to hold for a much bigger win too because 1. Volatility was  high so I knew we would see a big range move but 2. It allowed me to survive the whipsaws. Essentially sizing down 50% (on some plays 25% on ES) I was actually able to kill it profit wise. I have made 1k in a day before on an account but I usually don’t hit that kind of profits… usually because I stop trading or mostly because I don’t let my winners run as I want to lock in profits. This is certainly something I want to watch going into next week to see how it plays out. As long as VIX is higher and especially with the crazy week of volatility ahead I want to experiment some more with this.

As of market open Monday I should have my three funded accounts back up and running and have my 5 back up evals dormant and ready to go. Overall not the week I wanted but it was a teachable moment.",1722024335,829848,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,e2df15a3efd18fa3e7c1b49608ad33e4eed0be5f46e945b574611eaed2fdd49f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ecxjy0/is_there_more_to_go_on_this_correction_72624_spy/
2537,"New Rebar Standards in China Could Drive Vanadium Demand: Temas Resources (TMAS.c) Advances Sustainable Titanium, Vanadium, and Iron Projects in Quebec","In September, China plans to implement a new standard for rebar steel that will impact vanadium, the most common addition for high strength rebar. The 2018 standard increased the required amount of vanadium, but compliance has been limited to only 20% of producers. Therefore, the new, stricter enforcement could substantially increase the demand for vanadium. 

[https://x.com/mineralstocks/status/1816117053163446360](https://x.com/mineralstocks/status/1816117053163446360)

Temas Resources (Ticker: TMAS.c or TMASF for U.S. investors) is making significant advancements with its two Titanium, Vanadium, and Iron projects in Quebec. The company's La Blache and Lac Brule projects are well-positioned, benefiting from Quebec's favorable mining conditions and their proximity to a deep-water port on the St. Lawrence River.

Temas Resources is leading in sustainable mining practices, utilizing advanced processing methods and patented leaching technologies to reduce environmental impact and carbon emissions.

TMAS has proprietary technology for processing and recovering V2O5, TiO2, and Fe2O3. This patented ORF chloride leaching technology, created in collaboration with the University of Minnesota is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly, cutting processing costs by up to 65% and recycling over 95% of reagents.

Preliminary metallurgical testing of the oxide mineralization has shown impressive results, with a 95% recovery rate for vanadium and 90% recovery rate for iron producing a high-purity final product.

The La Blache project is particularly notable, with an estimated net present value (NPV) of $6.6 billion. It is projected to produce 660,000 tons of Titanium Dioxide annually over a 14-year period, according to a recent Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). Moreover, the project's Mineral Resources Statement also shows significant vanadium and iron resources.

Moreover, the Quebec Government has recognized the strategic importance of titanium and vanadium mining, highlighting the potential of this project.

To further its exploration efforts, Temas Resources raised $1,719,738 this spring. Company directors contributed $670,738, about 40% of the total amount, demonstrating their strong confidence in the projects.

2556,$RNXT is getting overlooked while they quietly expand their cancer treatments,"RenovoRx, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is pioneering novel precision oncology therapies through its local drug-delivery platform, Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP).

**Highlights from Recent Developments**

Pre-Clinical Studies Publication: The company recently published pre-clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy and innovative drug delivery mechanism of the TAMP platform. This data supports TAMP's potential to transform cancer treatment by delivering chemotherapy directly to solid tumors, minimizing systemic side effects.

Pancreatic Cancer Focus: One of the most promising applications of TAMP is in treating pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Traditional chemotherapy is administered intravenously, leading to widespread side effects. In contrast, TAMP targets the tumor directly, potentially increasing effectiveness and reducing adverse effects.

Expert Insight: Dr. Farsad, an expert in the field, highlights the significance of TAMP, stating, “TAMP has the potential to provide a valuable treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Early studies suggest it can increase local therapeutic tissue concentration independent of traditional methods. We are eagerly awaiting the final outcomes of the ongoing Phase III clinical trial to validate these benefits.”

**Solid Foundation and Potential Growth?**

1. Lead Product Showcases Promising Growth: RenovoGem™, an oncology drug-device combination, delivers targeted chemotherapy using the TAMP technology directly to tumor sites while reducing common side effects. Currently in clinical trials, RenovoGem™ has received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer, offering years of market exclusivity and the potential to be a groundbreaking treatment.
2. Wide Market Landscape: The TAMP platform's ability to reduce systemic exposure while delivering high concentrations of chemotherapy directly to tumors holds promise beyond pancreatic cancer, potentially revolutionizing treatment for various hard-to-treat cancers.
3. Strategic and Experienced Leadership: CEO Shaun R. Bagai, who joined RenovoRx in June 2014, has a proven track record in innovative technological launches for growth companies and large corporations. The leadership team boasts over 200 years of experience in drug development and commercialization, with successful blockbuster drug launches.

2559,"Market Chops to Start “The Big Week” 7-29-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I anticipated with the crazy amount of data, FOMC and earnings that comes starting tomorrow that we would actually have a pretty strong Monday. While the overnight certainly appeared to be that way… intraday today was actually quite the struggle for bulls. Today turned into yet again another high wick and high volatility Monday. This has been our norm for quite a while now.

https://preview.redd.it/amvyr507lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13d627b920235f19029c5f1102904073dcd81d4

We do have JOLTS at 10am tomorrow which I suspect will cause a ton of market movement.

https://preview.redd.it/hfwp0v97lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=519ea2112f869ef9d62721a777b28d0a051a80cf

After hours tomorrow we will get AMD and Microsoft which both likely will cause a major move in this market. Which then takes us right into FOMC on Wednesday.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/vqyxv3l7lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c070e952114c9d200b2bf8331989a354c71a4e4

Today in the end really was nothing more than a chop day. Here on SPY we have a bounce off the daily 50ema support of 542.01 but we also have a rejection off the daily 8ema resistance of 547.22. As of right now the sellers have weakened for two days in a row but we are sitting on the edge of extreme bear momentum.

In general if we can CLOSE over 547.22 the daily 8ema then I expect a breakout over the 20ema resistance near 549.13.

If we close under 542.01 the daily 50ema I expect a retest of demand at 538.3.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 530.36 -> 531.39 -> 554.7 -> 564.94  
Demand- 533.59 -> 538.3 -> 548.93 -> 561.58

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/7e8b46w7lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e328c86c377eaef0bb857cc5ae478babadb2a94e

The rejection here on ES appears to be more bearish with this doji candle rejection critical daily 8ema resistance at 5534. However, in general when we have a longer body doji like this (not a true double top on daily) these actually end up being continuation higher candles.

If this is more of a support bounce off the daily 50ema support of 5479 then we should expect a decent push up to the daily 20ema resistance of 5556 tomorrow.

However, if this is the rejection off resistance of the 8ema at 5534 then we should generally expect the double demand support of 5436-5445 to be retested.

Again this candle is nothing but consolidation and directionaless chop. There is realistically not a solid direction right now with weaker sellers, rejecting resistance while also bouncing off support and sitting on the edge of extreme daily bear momentum.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5325 -> 5610 -> 5716  
Demand- 5353 -> 5436 -> 5545 -> 5552 -> 5639

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/9falvk68lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c814fd8dca96272f8a527e156d33a5522cd515

Pretty similar movement here on QQQ but with separate EMAs… here on QQQ we are holding that 100ema support (and demand) near 548.11. However, we have not officially broken out back to the daily 8 and 50ema (which are BEARISHLY) crossed under near 471.93 demand.

Here on QQQ we ARE in extreme bear momentum but today the sellers weakened again. Honestly I don’t see a solid long term direction here until we either CLOSE over 471.93 or under 458.11. Realistically we are looking at a long term BEAR flag versus daily v bottom.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 441.14 -> 482.4 -> 502.99  
Demand- 442 -> 450.65 ->458.11 ->  471.93 -> 475.29 -> 497.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/skug21l8lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=32bd19aac3b9a874d2c9e2160e437b2ab5f5d4e5

Here on NQ I honestly wanna favor that this is a BULLISH bounce rather than a bearish rejection (bear flag). We much like QQQ are holding the demand/ support of the 100ema 18991 but we have not recovered over the resistance of the daily 8/50ema which are bearishly crossed under near 19592 demand. Again to get a bigger macro direction we must close over 19592 or under 18991.

I do generally with weaker daily sellers here and this bounce (failed double top) expect some upside continuation tomorrow with that target being 19592-19697 double demand that was support before.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 17917 -> 19986 -> 20897  
Demand- 18234 -> 18594 -> 18991 -> 19592 -> 19697

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/x2hbopy8lifd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c399143c955be31a2ce801f16819c00d26492c

Looking at the VIX today I am honestly a bit surprised by the way markets moved. The sell off from about 1pm until power hour was primarily driven by sellers and not the VIX… the VIX honestly did a whole not of nothing during that time period. This market has relied so heavily on the VIX for the last 3+ months for intraday movement it was a bit surprising to see the market move without the VIX. However, that is likely why we saw the big recovery there into the beginning of power hour.

Much like ES/ NQ the VIX finds itself in a nice range here too… we have key resistance of the 18.44 supply from last week and then we have the daily 8ema support here at 16.2. Followed by that we have the daily 20ema support and demand near 14.88 to watch. In general if the VIX loses the daily 20ema support and demand I would generally be VERY bullish on ES and NQ to push back near ATHs… however, if the VIX can hold this daily 8ema support we may see a big push back up to 18.44 which then brings markets back into their previous demands/ lows.

I finally broke the curse of Mondays for me. I have been struggling so hard on Mondays as of lately and it was nice to get back into the groove of things. However, my 2^(nd) account just continued to see and feel the woes… that accounts first trade was red and that account bounced from big big red to slightly red like it closed to major red back to slightly red all day. I just couldn’t find a good solid trade.

I had a nice big green day in the other two accounts and did give back a bit of those gains unfortunately due to the failed recovery/ breakout in the afternoon. I again don’t see what really took us lower there as it just seemed like every single move up was rejected without a real true basis as to why it was.

In the end a good day and green day of trading.

I have enjoyed this scaling in that I have been using. It has actually been very helpful and less stressful. I still need to after 1130am stop trading all together as this market continues to be impossible to read after 1130am and just goes into mindless and endless chop.",1722283556,829916,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,98b3b7ce5314d50ae49ba2c955c9507235dfdd3c57ff7671d0d7711697d95798,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ef9cmi/market_chops_to_start_the_big_week_72924_spy_es/

2561,Untapped Opportunity in the Royalty Space: Nations Royalty's Strategic Expansion in the Golden Triangle (Article Summary)," Kitco News, a leading source in precious metals reporting, recently highlighted newcomer Nations Royalty (Ticker: NRC.v) and how it has positioned itself as a pioneer in the royalty sector, particularly within the Golden Triangle, a region known for its rich mineral resources. 

According to Kody Penner, VP of Corporate Development, Nations Royalty enjoys a first-mover advantage in leveraging benefits agreements that have been largely untapped in the royalty space.

Nations Royalty's foundation is built on five Nisga’a Benefits Agreement Royalties, collectively valued at $214 million. These agreements provide Nations Royalty with a significant edge, uniting First Nations and Indigenous groups across Canada while attracting external investors.

Highlighted projects under these agreements include:

* **Brucejack Gold Mine**: Operated by Pretium Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Newmont, this high-grade underground gold mine is a key asset.
* **KSM Deposit:** A copper-gold-silver-molybdenum deposit being developed by Seabridge Gold.
* **Premier Gold Project:** Commissioned by Ascot Resources, this project saw its first gold pour in April 2024, with commercial production set for Q3 2024.
* **Red Mountain Gold Deposit:** Also owned by Ascot Resources, this deposit adds to Nations Royalty's diverse portfolio.
* **Kitsault Molybdenum Deposit:** A fully permitted brownfield site advanced by New Moly, majority-owned by Resource Capital Fund VI.

Penner emphasized Nations Royalty's unique position to access tier-one assets that are cash-producing in safe jurisdictions. This strategic advantage allows the company to operate within lower cost quartiles, a benefit not typically available to smaller royalty companies.

Nations Royalty's innovative approach and strategic agreements position it as a leader in the royalty space, capitalizing on untapped opportunities within the Golden Triangle. The company's vision of uniting First Nations and welcoming external investors underscores its commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth in the mining sector.

# Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

**Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115%**

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

**On The Horizon**

Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

**Before Market Open**

**Boeing ($BA)**: Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",1722379004,829938,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,02b5ddb11a26b30e5ac5ef0df1e1f53454c1967fcda09ded8f164a78a0d1c2c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eg6y5t/market_recap_today_07302024_msftamd_earnings/
2573,Vior Inc. (VIO.v) Bolstered by $22 Million Cash Position to Explore its Belleterre Gold Project vs. (Mcap = $35 Million),"The cornerstone of Vior Inc's (Ticker: VIO.v or VIORF for US investors) portfolio is the Belleterre Gold Project, an expansive district-scale exploration initiative covering 572 square kilometers in Quebec's Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. 

https://preview.redd.it/rdej5126oqfd1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=923ed8716491ece561214075d18a5f6aa71017a6

This project includes the historic Belleterre Gold Mine, which yielded approximately 800,000 ounces of gold at an exceptional grade of 10.7 g/t between 1936 and 1959.

2575,WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) combined brain-computer interface with AI technology to solve software problem,"July 22-Startup Inbrain Neuro electronics is experimenting with a brain-computer interface (BCI) using graphene chips, aiming to test a graphene-based brain-computer interface at the University of Manchester this summer.

Last week, Synchron, a brain-computer interface (BCI) company, announced that it would integrate OpenAI’s AI model into its BCI platform chat capabilities, which provide users with generated chat capabilities.

Last month, the brain-computer interaction and human-computer integration at Haihe Laboratory released its latest scientific research results. Collaborating with the Southern University of Science and Technology, they successfully developed an on-chip brain-computer interface system for four years. The system, by cultivating biological cells, forms an external brain, which connects the brain to an electrode chip to achieve mind control.

At home and abroad, it has to be said that recently, the cutting-edge technology of brain-computer interfaces has progressed rapidly and taken an important step forward. In general terms, the brain-computer interface is a “brain reading” technology, which, through real-time monitoring of human brain activities, analyzes and interprets the control instructions people want to express. In theory, this is not a new technology. As early as 50 years ago, some scholars proposed the concept of “brain-computer interface (BCI)”.

On the other hand, brain-computer interface technology is mainly divided into invasive and non-invasive two types. Invasive brain-computer interfaces signal more accurately and at high frequency and can create specific feelings in the brain through precise electrical stimulation. However, in terms of technical means, the electrodes still need to be implanted through craniotomy, and there are some safety and ethical risks. In contrast, non-invasive brain-computer interfaces have high security, a large audience, and a broad prospect for industrialization.

At present, brain-computer interface technology is moving from science fiction to reality. Although its main beneficiaries are still patients with severe physical disorders, with the deepening of research and the expansion of application, it will unlock more brain potential in the future, improve human physical and cognitive ability, and redefine the boundary of human ability.

Undoubtedly, brain-computer interface technology is expected to be regarded as a cutting-edge key technology, attracting a large number of enterprises to develop application scenarios and try industrial transformation. In this context, it is understood that in this field, as a representative of the “brain-computer interface practice” enterprise, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) combined brain-computer interface with AI technology to solve software problem, such as artificial intelligence hardware technology, have good technology accumulation, the future can be used for rehabilitation research and development, brain computing and other fields

At present, WiMi established a micro consciousness quantum research center that brought together computer science, biology, polymer chemistry, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and many other scientific fields, and through a series of certified as “safe” AI technology ecosystems to build, deployment operation environment, brain-computer interface fu an enterprise application, fully shows the company in the field of brain-computer interface technology research progress and future vision.

It can be said that the MicroConsciousness Quantum Science Research Center established by WiMi has built a bridge connecting basic science and applied technology, and closely connects the profound theoretical research of basic science and the broad practice of applied technology. It will not only focus on basic scientific research, but also promote the birth of a series of disruptive technologies in practice, actively promote the transformation of research results to practical applications, and is expected to promote the productivity innovation of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

From the perspective of technology research, technology is an important tool to solve real-world problems. Once the brain-computer interface technology is used, it will serve the society more efficiently. In addition, the combination of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interface will also play an increasingly greater role in promoting human medical care, health, education, and even the development of the whole society.

It should be noted that tech maniac Musk said that the ultimate goal of brain-computer interfaces is to go beyond the repair of the lost brain function of the disabled and give humans superpowers. He said: ” I think this should give hope to a lot of people around the world, and the future will be exciting and inspiring, and the technology will give them superpowers.”In the long run, it is possible.

The company is making waves with its innovative RenovoTAMP therapy, targeting difficult-to-treat cancers. The stock has seen little volatility, even with the ongoing clinical trials.

With recent positive data releases, FDA approval might not be too far into the future. RenovoRx just posted positive early data results from their Phase III Clinical trials, and published them in the latest edition of ""The Oncologist,"" a peer-reviewed medical journal. However, as always, it's a biotech play, so there’s risk involved.

2579,"ABQQ (Epic DD) Movie streaming platform like TUBI/Netflix, movie licensing and more","This is one of the best OTCs I seen in a while. News out yesterday regarding licensing a new movie to a distributor. Also they have really good financials and they just reached net profitability last quarter. Their revenue is growing too and they have a highly scalable business model which I will go over. Last quarter they did 698k in revenue so that's like 2.8M annualized without even counting their growth rate. 2.8M doesn’t sound like a lot but this is trading in the trips. Most pennystocks in the trips don’t even make a dollar. They did 133K Net Profit on the 698K revenue so they have decent profit margins. 

 Now going into their business. They have 3-4 different revenue streams. 

 •ONLINE MOVIE STREAMING PLATFORM 
The company owns ABQQ TV which is a movie/TV show streaming platform. It has a paid subscription model similar to Netflix, Paramount and also advertising revenue model similar to ROKU, PlutoTV and TUBI. Online Movie/TV streaming platforms are taking over the old school cable and satellite TV subscription services. Also these streaming platforms are worth a lot of money. For example TUBI was acquired by FOX for 400M in 2020. Also PlutoTV was acquired for 340M by Viacom in 2019. Now ABQQ TV not as big yet but it is in a special niche with low competition which is foreign movies, specifically Chinese movies as for now. 

 China is ranked the number 2 county in total box office sales and produced movies for more than over the past decade. 

 Here are the 5 box office ranks for 2023 
1. USA - $18,724,733,436 
2. China - $6,847,815,089 <— 
3. U.K. - $2,409,440,455 
4. Japan - $2,087,836,037 
5. Korea - $553,038,884 

 •MOVIE THEATRE BUSINESS 
ABQQ also owns AB Cinemas which is a physical walk-in style movie theater like AMC, Regal Cinemas, Cinemark, Cineplex, etc. ABQQ’s AB Cinemas is currently fully operational and generating revenue through ticket sales, food & beverages. Through a quick google search you can see they have 293 Google reviews on their New York location. They only have one location so far but they are looking to expand to more locations from what I've read. 

MOVIE LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION 
Another way they generate revenue is through licensing of foreign movies that they have the rights to. For example yesterday they issued a press release where they made $300k for licensing a Chinese movie “THE ONE"" (YiJianZhongQing). They licensed the movie to a well known film distributor in China, Hua Xia Film Group. The way it works is ABQQ possess rights to various IP like franchise rights, patented innovations, or copyrighted materials. They generate revenue by permitting other individuals or businesses to utilize these assets under specific terms and conditions, more clearly outlined in a licensing agreement.

Overall they have a pretty large international business. Growing revenue, net profitable, healthy balance sheet. Highly scalable business model. The key takeaway is their current market cap is only 1M. The company had a big run up in the past and is currently trading back at the ground level which is why the market cap is so low right now.

The biggest thing I could find for why we dropped was because of the BOJ rate hike announcement. The BOJ ended up increasing rates overnight and as you saw pre market the market did not care one single bit… seems like an odd move yesterday. It is incredibly frustrating getting burnt all day yesterday looking for longs only for it to play out perfectly today.

https://preview.redd.it/kpts3dgrvwfd1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dfcf14ddb2578dcf6c9ae12c3c81e34ae6e0500

Honestly this daily range right here is truly incredible… almost 200% of the average 10 day daily range for ES and NQ…

Lets take a review of what was said during FOMC today (note- pulled from various social media sources).

·         The Fed repeats does not expect it will be appropriate to lower rates until it has gained greater confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.

·         The labor market has come into better balance.

·         We have made considerable progress on both goals in the past 2 years.

·         In the housing sector, investment stalled in 2Q.

·         Recent indicators suggest the economy has continued to expand at a solid pace.

·         The pace of spending has slowed but remains solid.

·         Inflation remains somewhat above the 2% goal.

·         A broad set of labor market indicators show it is strong, but not overheated.

·         Data suggests that the labor market has returned to where it was on the eve of the pandemic.

·         **Q2 inflation readings have added to our confidence.**

·         We need greater confidence on inflation.

·         The longer-term inflation expectations appear well anchored.

·         Policy is well-positioned.

·         We will carefully assess incoming data for future decisions.

·         We have made no decisions about future meetings, including September.

·         Reducing too late could unduly weaken the economy.

·         There is a broad sense that we are getting closer, but not quite at that point yet.

·         **A rate cut could be on the table in September.**

·         There's a broad sense at the FOMC is we are moving closer.

·         Fed's Powell when asked about September cut: if inflation moves down in line with expectations, growth remains reasonably strong, the labor market remains as it is, rate cut in sept would be on the table.

·         **I can imagine a scenario of zero cuts to several cuts this year, depending on how the economy evolves.**

·         We don't think of the labor market as it is currently as a likely source of inflation pressures. That's why I don't want to see excess cooling in the labor market.

·         If we see something that looks like a significant downturn in labor market, then we would respond.

·         All of the data continues to point in a direction we want to see.

·         We are actually in a good place here, we are balancing risks.

·         It's coming to the time to adjust rates to support our continued process.

·         In a base case, you would think policy rates would move down from here.

·         The job is not done on inflation, but can afford to begin to dial back restriction in the policy rate.

·         We don't need to be 100% focused on inflation.

·         We are now getting broader disinflation.

·         Upside risks to inflation have decreased as the job market cools. Downside risks to employment mandate are real now.

Honestly… this was a pretty standard in line with expectations (hence upside move) for FOMC. Markets have began in my opinion pricing in this rate cut scenario. Now that the market got the confirmation that is what we are working towards I truly think the upside is likely to continue here… remember historically speaking the recession and really the market crash that comes with rate cuts does not usually start until the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) cut. Tomorrow is decision day… bulls broke through major resistance today… they now need to hold that support tomorrow.

I find this chart to be incredibly interesting… we are hitting the longest lead time to recession outside of 1965 which avoided a recession… is this time different?

https://preview.redd.it/jlpjgubsvwfd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=40d90f4e9b3d5e6f0cc383d6c26d0ba156e5561c

As you can see by this chart from the FIRST rate cut… in general year out WITH a recession 9 out of 10 times stocks are LOWER than the first cut… in general a year out WITHOUT a recession… 8 out of 8 times stocks were HIGHER…

Looking at that chart you can see about 30-60 days post first rate cut market appears to start making a move…

https://preview.redd.it/j5yhswlsvwfd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a92e61faa849d8986710ddd807c3c836344b208

We will follow up todays FOMC meeting with another data heavy morning. In general we should expect this move to continue honestly. It would appear the last few weeks of downside has fully priced in the rate cut fed scenarios.

https://preview.redd.it/lmfiyxwsvwfd1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a25a2549bca4e85850fc702204665cd8eb7a843

Todays opening was the biggest green day for a FOMC in almost two years. It also was the biggest green close in almost two years… generally speaking looking at Post-FOMC day trends the last 6 meetings in a row have opened green with the average being over 0.5%+… only 4 of the last 13 meetings have opened red on post-fomc day…

I have a strong feeling todays major recovery is likely the bottom of this correction and we will likely be heading to ATHs into that first cut in September.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/rsdi6v8tvwfd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5384f85cf485ac2b1f2108e544b24b99c3d12147

Now while this is definitely a big move to the upside and certainly hard to ignore how bullish this move it… the one thing that is really kind of catching me off guard that this move COULD be fake is the fact that our daily sellers today BARELY dropped. Honestly with a massive almost 2% day here we realistically should have seen a major drop in sellers if not seen buyers return… that does concern me a bit for long term bullishness.

The bulls managed to retake the daily 8 and 20ema resistance which I said was major and super important to regain control. I do think bulls are back in control. However, they must now defend this 8/20ema support near 548.83 and need to close over 554.7 supply/ resistance to be fully back in control. Much like 7/23/24 we could see a failed recovery and rejection tomorrow.

Bears must close this back under the daily 8/20ema support around 548.83 to be back in control.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 554.7 -> 564.94  
Demand- 539.39 -> 561.58

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

This is one of the more impressive candles on ES that we have lately. Even more impressive is the fact that it all came before FOMC realistically. Now yesterday we did that new supply at 5505 after the fake sell off we had (very trappy by the market). Now that we have bounced and broken through that resistance we have established a VERY strong triple demand/ support area from 5436- 5452. Realistically even if we get a hard rejection tomorrow and sell back off I have a very hard time believing in a bigger correction or long term correction until that triple demand is broken and CLOSED under.

Bulls retook the daily 8/20ema resistance in one smooth move and now need to defend that level at 5549 tomorrow. A closure over 5610 would be even more bullish.

Bears must hard reject this tomorrow and seek a closure under daily 8/ 20ema support near 5549 to be back in control.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5505 -> 5610 -> 5716  
Demand- 5436 -> 5445 -> 5452 -> 5639

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/04vnovvtvwfd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f285f4284754fbf1268e7ebc8905e6c9d5d2bb

While the move here on QQQ truly is incredible in the fact that we completely gapped up and over the whole candle from yesterday. I honestly don’t know many times that we have gapped up over a previous days high and still pushed higher… definitely a historical move here…

We have much like SPY broke through the red bear channel here… however, exactly like SPY here I am kinda stumped by the lack of weakening by sellers… truly this sort of move should have likely brought buyers back in… the one explanation here is that this was a short squeeze by the VIX not really buying/ sellers. Which realistically makes sense and actually gives more favor to a bearish case…

We did breakout over the daily 8 and 50ema resistance today. We did not quite get to the daily 20ema resistance sitting near 475.29 demand. That is the level bulls need to close over next to be in control again.

Bears must reject here and seek a closure under daily 8 ema support of 468.55 but realistically under 465.78 supply.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 465.78 -> 482.4 -> 502.99  
Demand- 450.65 -> 457.64 -> 475.29 -> 497.71

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

Just a casual 3.3% move from low to high on NQ today or 712pts…  not something you see every day… Now much like ES we put in a new supply at 19231 yesterday which brings a new daily demand at 18862. This is clearly a very strong support and also sits right with our daily 100ema support too.

From here we honestly are sitting at a pretty major resistance area... the daily 50ema and 20ema are the next major levels to watch. 19697 is our next major demand level to watch which also perfectly sits with the daily 20ema resistance too. The bulls did a lot of damage to the bear trend today as you can see but again the bulls are not out of the woods yet.

Bulls must close over 19697 tomorrow and seek a move to 19986 supply.

Bears have to reject here and close minimally back under daily 8ema support at 19395 but ideally under 19231 supply to be back in control.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 19231 -> 19986 -> 20897  
Demand- 18594 -> 18862 -> 19697

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/8m804eruvwfd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=666b9289dcbdea07814acd7655371ba2b85f9385

I mentioned yesterday that the VIX did NOT put in a new demand and it did not close over 18.44 supply which I felt was extremely significant. It played out pretty much perfectly here and we ended up finding a major rejection here on the VIX… if you don’t look carefully at this candle you wont notice that the VIX gapped down to the opening price of yesterday. Yesterday closed at 17.69 and we opened at 16.66 today… pretty powerful and impressive drop here… this as I said Is what truly drove this market higher over night.

Now the question with this bounce off daily 20ema support on the VIX is what comes next… there absolutely is a pretty impressive potential rejection here tomorrow. IF the vix hard rejects off this support we could see a very impressive red day tomorrow.

This market has a history (not lately) but during 2021-2023 in pricing things in the exact opposite over night… this market from end of 2023 to 2024 realistically has just been buy the dip and let it ride… we are not seeing that currently… I really do think the downside potential for tomorrow is high. However, its incredibly risky for sure.

Pretty much a redemption day here for me. I ended up longing an Eval with two ES overnight and woke up to that account passing. I honestly didn’t expect 137 pts on ES today… I considered when I long my EVAL to open a few MES in my funded but I had such a rough day yesterday I really didn’t want to waste another funded account if I was wrong. Would have been a pretty great win if I did.

However, I actually got a decent amount of trades in this morning which is a bit unusual for a FOMC day as they don’t usually bring much movement. I was lookin for a quicker and bigger short this morning but it ended up turning into a major breakout which I got in on and took some wins… overall seeing all three accounts in the green is the goal and im happy with today. I didn’t end up trading this FOMC. I wanted to trade a long around 230 but we just never a pullback I felt comfortable getting in.",1722456618,829960,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,48fb34a108ab1cb45331b0263f37239aede8b019dd29b30513b1d3a9d30580ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1egx1vi/bulls_massively_pump_on_fomc_day_73124_spy_es/
2585,TODAY: Prismo Metals (PRIZ.c) Mobilizes for New Drilling Campaign at Palos Verdes Silver/Gold Project,"Today, Prismo Metals Inc. (Ticker: PRIZ.c or PMOMF for US investors) announced the mobilization of a man-portable drill for its upcoming drilling program at its Palos Verdes property in the historic Panuco-Copala silver-gold district of Sinaloa, Mexico. 

The drill campaign, scheduled to commence next week (the week of August 5th), represents a strategic collaboration between Prismo and Vizsla Silver Corp. (Ticker: VZLA.v), enabling Prismo to utilize drill pads on Vizsla’s adjacent concessions for improved drilling efficiency.

This new drilling campaign marks the fourth phase of exploration on the Palos Verdes concession, which spans 700 meters of the Palos Verdes vein. 

This exploration is particularly promising given the high-grade mineralization encountered in previous drilling, including an intercept with 102 g/t gold, 3,100 g/t silver, and 0.26% zinc over 0.5 meters, which translates to an impressive 11,520 g/t silver equivalent.

The primary objectives of the drilling program are to trace the down-dip extension of the mineralized shoot previously identified in the southwestern portion of the vein, explore the continuation of the vein across a cross-fault believed to have offset the vein downward, and test the extreme northeasterly extension of the Palos Verdes vein system near the historical Jesusita mine.

Dr. Craig Gibson emphasized the strategic advantage of this campaign, noting that drilling from Vizsla Silver’s ground will allow for better hole geometry and the ability to test the Palos Verdes vein at greater depths than previously possible. 

The collaboration between Prismo and Vizsla underscores the importance of partnerships in advancing exploration in this richly mineralized district.

The ongoing exploration at Palos Verdes is part of a broader and highly active second half of 2024 for Prismo, which also includes its fully permitted Hot Breccia copper project in Arizona. 

CEO Alain Lambert expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming results from these two world-class exploration projects, highlighting the potential for significant discoveries.

As Prismo continues its exploration activities, the Company remains focused on unlocking the full potential of its assets in Mexico and the United States. 

With promising early results and a well-defined exploration strategy, Prismo is poised to make substantial strides in its pursuit of precious and base metals in these regions.

**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**

Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed’s July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September—if the data plays nice. While Powell didn’t drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here’s the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a “nice conversation” about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn’t likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a “very difficult judgment call,” outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn’t fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell’s remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he’s still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year’s end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed’s dual mandate—curbing inflation while keeping employment high—requires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed’s next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they’re the key ingredients for what happens in September.

**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street’s expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what’s driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it’s going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business—digital advertising—continues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That’s more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He’s not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta’s open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta’s bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta’s operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company’s cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We’re still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there’s still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it’s in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren’t feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a “sell.” Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

Amazon (AMZN) hasn’t seen the same sky-high gains as some other tech giants this year, but investors are still confident in its cloud business, post-pandemic profitability, and AI initiatives. And if you thought the love for Apple was strong, every one of the 39 analysts covering Amazon rates it a “buy.” Expectations: $1.03 EPS, $148.57 billion in revenue.",1722474513,829959,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,6b7416a3227a12de5ba5e6f50ff0d5f40a8d0a0041f8faa9df38561207eeebef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eh3xoa/market_recap_07312024_fed_holds_rate_steady_meta/

2593,"Bears Erase FOMC Gains… 8-1-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Well first off Happy August! May your August be full of big green gains and very tiny red losses… we are officially exiting our summer trading (officially will at end of the month) which means we should start to see some volume and more importantly continuation come back into the market.

Now yesterday if you remember I was leary of the upside because I found it incredibly odd that the bulls did not bring buyers back into the market. It appeared on paper that it was mearily a VIX dump that caused the rally…. Likely a lack of needed volatility on FOMC… however, of course as I said in 2022-2023 the market has a tendency to well digest things the opposite over night. Actually looking back to 2022-2023 this is a CLASSIC fomc move… where markets basically completely inverse the previous days move. Now did I expect a 100% complete reverse from HOD to LOD? Absolutely not haha… but I think this move really sets the tone… this is now our third major failed recovery on markets since we started our bear trend on July 16^(th).

https://preview.redd.it/njoto3u404gd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=67abc4edbdc23cf6123c8201eaf00e634cbf0491

Now to add to the spiciness of overnight… tomorrow at 830a we will get the UE rate… now as you can see since May 2023 we have seen UE rate steadily rising… we broke through two months ago a critical resistance of 3.9%... putting UE rate at the highest levels it has been since Feb 2022… Now with our rate at 4.1% we likely based on jobless claims and jolts will see a move up to 4.2% tomorrow… this move puts the UE rate at the highest level it has been since December 2021.

Now while JPOW some how claimed that a weakening labor market was good… I don’t think markets believe him… remember for a SOFT landing to happen we must have a STRONG economy and LOWER inflation when fed starts to cut… as of now… while inflation is coming down.. we are also seeing a really strong spike on UE.  This 4.2% spike tomorrow could bring on a major continuation for the bears as markets will likely not only price in more rate cuts (due to the fact that the fed went higher for longer too long…) and because fears of a hard landing will be increased.

On SPY we have completely brought back in stronger daily sellers which are matching the previous strength of sellers when we were at these levels. With this massive rejection and basically two day long bearish engulfing reversal we have put in a new supply at 550.95.

It appears fairly obvious here that 550.95-554.7 is our critical resistance and rejection area. Also as you can see the EMAs remain bearishly crossed under here and that remains a sign of prolonged bearishness ahead.

We now find ourselves in a major daily support area of 538.39. Below here we look for 533.59.

While the thought of capitulation into the weekend is high… the odds of a bounce here and the nastiest of the algos/ MM would bring a major support bounce up into the 545-546 area to burn all the shorts first.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 530.36 -> 531.39 -> 550.95 -> 554.7 -> 564.94  
Demand- 533.59 -> 539.39 -> 561.58

Now looking at ES here and on SPY but lets focus on it now you can see the major red bear trend that we are in and re-established today. Now not only that but we have a MASSIVE daily bear flag that we just broke through support for today… its VERY rare to see a 130 point range on ES like yesterday… its even more rare to see a 156 point range to completely erase all those gains the following day… this truly was an incredible bearish move… now the question is though can the bears follow through… can they take this lower and hold it lower?

We are in a major support area here of 5436-5450… if we do break lower here I would generally not be too surprised if we saw a decent reversal to retest these levels first.

However, if we lose this 5436-5450 support then we are looking at a truly correction and test of the daily 100ema support near 5353 demand.

An incredible day here on QQQ too with almost 200% of the 10 day average range which is really saying something with some of the moves we have had lately! We brough back in stronger daily sellers and a new supply at 471.06. Now much like SPY we have truly really established 471.06 as a major supply and resistance. This is also a major rejection off the 8, 20 and 50ema resistance today too. One thing I am watching for is the daily 20ema to also cross under the daily 50ema… This would establish and incredibly strong bear trend and one that we have not seen (where 8, 20 and 50ema are under eachother) since April.

Now while daily 20/50ema resistance and supply at 471.06 are clearly critical resistance we can not ignore this support area of the daily 100ema and demand of 457.64. The next major level down to watch is demand at 450.65 and 442.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS

Again just a truly impressive move and day here on NQ… with 850 points of range after its 800 point range yesterday is truly extraordinary. With this new supply at 19585 and a major rejection here off the daily 8, 20 and 50ema resistance we once again are in a bear trend and the bears are left with a major potential breakdown here… however, we continue to lack follow through on the bearish side of things.

With 19585 being established as key resistance we also have the daily 100ema support of 18950 and the daily demand of 18862 to watch… below this there is really one more support at 18594 (demand) before a potential bigger sell off down to the daily 200ema at 17917 is possible… the daily 200ema on NQ has not been touched since October 2023 (yes when the bull rally started…).

A lot people also give me a hard time for my TA of the vix and my supply/ demand on the VIX… however, the VIX called this downside move to a T yesterday. Remember I said that candle that failed to break 20ema support was likely a sign of a potential reversal higher. I also said the big leg down would not start until VIX broke 18.44.

We had a major breakout over 18.44 and the highest level on the VIX since middle of April 2024. From here the VIX must sustain its rally over 18.44 and start moving towards 21.29-22.67 to bring a true correction and yes even possibly a bear market…

However, if we fail here then I think this is the best dip buying opportunity we could ask for in the last year. This rejection here… on the VIX… this sets up the perfect reversal higher tomorrow for the markets.

Well today I had a thought and I think I picked a terrible day due to the incredible range and volatility to try it… but I had a thought of I pass so many evals easily and in one day why not try and trade my funded accounts the same way… to get a quicker payout in one day? Well today I decided to go for it… it as you can see was a bit of a rollercoaster… I ended up opening 30 minutes getting wicked out of a short at basically the peak of the candle before basically the 700pt drop came for the day… I had take the remaining two accounts to about 1500… then on one of my accounts I accidentally shorted too many NQ (double clicked) and caught a major wick that blew my account… thankfully I was able to take my remaining ES account to a threshold needed to request a payout tonight.

Looking back on a day like today and really with the VIX as elevated as we are here I can not viably do this strategy with NQ… I mean 50-100 pt candles are just impossible to trade with a 50k funded… ES is and was good… I will perhaps look to continue to perfect this strategy of entering with 1 ES con and adding as I feel correct with an initial stop loss at 10pts which gives me a max loss of $500 until I add cons…

Overall a good day since I got a payout but this volatility today was beyond brutal. I do think this strategy has a place but I think its one I should trade on only one account and trade my normal strategy on the others… I also think with VIX as elevated as it is I must rely on ES as NQ just is too volatile and hard to trade like that without getting my drawdown hit. Overall I plan to revert back to my normal strategy tomorrow and maybe toy with this in another account on the side.",1722542824,830005,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,78903edd444956fd93002684d6077dd756d496a972fc82714c5b70ccec2b8a3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ehqdhy/bears_erase_fomc_gains_8124_spy_es_futures_and/

2595,NexGold Mining (NEXG.v/TSRMF): Pioneering Growth with its Goliath Gold Complex and Bold Buy-and-Build Strategy,"NexGold Mining  (Ticker: NEXG.v or TSRMF for US investors),formerly known as Treasury Metals, is making significant strides in the mining industry as it embraces a bold buy-and-build strategy. 

As highlighted in a recent Northern Ontario Business article, the rebranding marks a significant transformation for the company. Under the leadership of President Morgan Lekstrom and CEO Jeremy Wyeth, NexGold is set to take the mining world by storm, beginning with its flagship project, the Goliath Gold Complex, located just 20 kilometers east of Dryden, Ontario.

https://preview.redd.it/qgqu462b25gd1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c8050891b065ab2b9802994c6095e7e68d7a953

The Goliath Gold Complex, which includes the Goliath, Goldlund, and Miller deposits, has been a long-awaited project with over a decade of anticipation. Now, NexGold is closer than ever to bringing this project to fruition, with plans to start construction on an open-pit mine by early 2026. The final feasibility study is expected by mid-2025, with all necessary permits and agreements anticipated to be completed within the same year.

With $16 million in the bank, NexGold is not just focusing on the development of the Goliath deposit but is also eager to explore the untapped potential across its expansive property. The company plans to resume exploration drilling, particularly in a promising 25-kilometer stretch between the Goliath and Goldlund deposits, which has the potential for ultra high-grade discoveries.

NexGold's buy-and-build strategy is a key component of its growth plan. The company is actively seeking to acquire stalled or struggling assets with significant gold resources, particularly those that have already navigated the environmental assessment permitting phase and are situated near existing infrastructure. This approach is aimed at assembling a portfolio of projects capable of producing 100,000 to 120,000 ounces of gold per year, minimizing the risk associated with single-asset dependence.

In addition to the Goliath Gold Complex, the Treasury-Blackwolf merger has brought the Niblack gold and copper project in southeast Alaska into NexGold's development pipeline. This project, with its fully built underground and surface camp infrastructure, represents a relatively turnkey opportunity for the company.

NexGold's strategic vision, supported by a team of experienced mine builders and the backing of prominent figures like mining financier Frank Giustra, is to establish itself as a formidable force in the Canadian gold mining industry. With a focus on building low-cost, multi-asset operations, NexGold is poised to avoid the pitfalls of single-mine risk and to deliver sustained growth in the coming years.

Amazon Couldn't Deliver — Cloud Gains, Retail Pains

Amazon’s second-quarter earnings report has landed, and it's clear that even the mighty e-commerce giant isn’t immune to cautious consumer spending. The company flagged that shoppers are increasingly bargain-hunting and downgrading to lower-priced items, which led to a revenue miss and a less-than-stellar forecast for Q3. The stock? It took a nosedive, dropping 6.85% in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Retail Reality Check

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Amazon’s ($AMZN) revenue came in at $148 billion, which, while impressive, was just a smidge below Wall Street’s expectations of $148.8 billion. This shortfall is largely thanks to consumers tightening their purse strings, leading to lower average selling prices (ASP) across the board. And the third quarter isn't looking much rosier, with Amazon's guidance falling short of what analysts had hoped for.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s CFO, mentioned that the revenue miss was driven by shoppers opting for cheaper products, a trend that's been increasingly noticeable. It seems consumers are playing it safe, holding onto their wallets a bit tighter as economic uncertainties loom.

Silver Linings in the Cloud

But it’s not all doom and gloom. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing cash cow, continues to shine. The segment saw a 19% jump in sales, raking in $26.3 billion and outpacing expectations. With the surge in demand for AI-driven tech, AWS is poised to keep growing, but the heavy investments required to keep up with this demand could squeeze margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising business, another profit powerhouse, grew by 20% to hit $12.8 billion—though it fell just shy of the $13 billion analysts had penciled in. It’s clear that the ad business is still a strong performer, even if it didn’t quite meet the high bar that had been set.

By the Numbers

Net Sales: $147.98 billion (+10% YoY), missed the estimate of $148.78 billion.
EPS: $1.26, beating the forecasted $1.04.
Operating Income: $14.67 billion, outpacing expectations of $13.59 billion.
AWS Sales: $26.28 billion (+19% YoY), topping the $25.98 billion estimate.
Advertising Revenue: $12.8 billion (+20% YoY), slightly below the $13 billion forecast.
Q3 Guidance: Revenue expected between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, compared to the analyst consensus of $158.43 billion.

The Road Ahead

So what’s next for Amazon? CEO Andy Jassy is betting big on AI, with plans to ramp up investments in this area. The company is also reportedly developing a discount digital storefront to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, aiming to capture the growing market of budget-conscious shoppers.

However, Amazon’s guidance for Q3 suggests the road ahead might be bumpy, especially with consumers remaining cautious and the looming competition in the discount space. Investors will need to keep a close eye on how these strategic moves play out in the coming months.

For now, it’s clear that while Amazon is still a force to be reckoned with, even it isn't immune to the changing tides of consumer behavior.

Apple’s Q3: iPads Power Up, While iPhones Hit Snooze

Apple ($AAPL) just rolled out its fiscal third-quarter earnings report, and while the tech giant managed to top Wall Street estimates, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The company’s revenue jumped 5% to $85.78 billion, surpassing the expected $84.53 billion, but China sales took a hit. Despite the mixed bag, Apple’s stock held steady in after-hours trading, up 13% year-to-date.
iPads Shine, iPhones Stumble

Apple’s ($AAPL) bread and butter, the iPhone, which still accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales, saw a slight revenue decline year-over-year to $39.3 billion. While this was better than the $38.81 billion analysts expected, it's still a 1% drop, marking a slowdown in what’s usually Apple’s star performer.
But where iPhones stumbled, iPads soared. Revenue from iPads surged nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion, fueled by the launch of a new lineup that had customers upgrading in droves. Even Mac sales got a modest boost, coming in at $7.01 billion, slightly above estimates.

The real hero of the quarter, however, was Apple’s Services division. From iCloud to Apple TV+, this segment raked in $24.21 billion, beating forecasts and continuing its streak as the company’s fastest-growing category. Tim Cook highlighted that Apple now boasts 1 billion paid subscriptions, underscoring the strength of its ecosystem.

By the Numbers
Revenue: $85.78 billion (+5% YoY), beating the $84.53 billion estimate.
EPS: $1.40, topping the forecasted $1.35.
iPhone Revenue: $39.30 billion, just above the $38.81 billion estimate.
iPad Revenue: $7.16 billion, crushing the $6.61 billion estimate.
Mac Revenue: $7.01 billion, slightly better than the $7.02 billion estimate.
Services Revenue: $24.21 billion, ahead of the $24.01 billion forecast.
Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $8.10 billion, surpassing the $7.79 billion estimate.
Greater China Revenue: $14.72 billion, missing the $15.26 billion estimate.

AI on the Horizon

Apple’s AI-driven Apple Intelligence, introduced in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference, was another hot topic. Tim Cook emphasized that while it’s too early to gauge its impact on iPhone sales, the tech is expected to be a game-changer, integrated across everyday apps. The catch? It’s only compatible with the latest iPhones, setting the stage for what could be a massive upgrade cycle.

China Concerns and the Road Ahead

While Apple’s overall numbers were solid, Greater China remains a challenge. Revenue in the region slipped to $14.72 billion, below expectations, as local competitors like Huawei continue to nibble away at Apple’s market share. But Cook is optimistic, pointing to record upgrades and improving sales trends.
Looking ahead, Apple expects continued revenue growth in the next quarter, with a focus on bolstering its AI capabilities. As Cook & Co. gear up for the iPhone 16 launch in September, all eyes will be on whether Apple Intelligence can deliver the next big wave of upgrades—and if the company can regain its footing in China.

Boeing's New Pilot: Can Kelly Ortberg Turn the Jet Around?

Boeing ($BA) is handing over the cockpit keys to a new captain, and not a moment too soon. After months of searching, the beleaguered aircraft maker has named Kelly Ortberg as its new CEO. Ortberg, an industry veteran with an engineering background, has the Herculean task of navigating Boeing through one of the most turbulent corporate turnarounds in recent history.

Despite the news of Ortberg's arrival giving Boeing’s stock a little lift, the company revealed a Q2 loss of $1.44 billion—yes, that’s billion with a ""B""—more than triple the $149 million loss from a year ago. That brings Boeing’s total losses since 2020 to nearly $25 billion.

A Bumpy Ride Ahead

Boeing’s troubles are far from over. The company is dealing with everything from manufacturing mishaps to heightened regulatory scrutiny (thanks to the infamous “doorgate” incident) and a supply chain that’s as tangled as a set of earphones. 

Here’s the lowdown:
Sales Dive: Last quarter saw a 15% drop in overall sales and a 32% nosedive in commercial aircraft deliveries. Not exactly the high-flying numbers investors were hoping for.
Burn Rate: Boeing’s operations are burning through roughly $1 billion per month, and that’s expected to continue at least through this quarter. Maybe they should start selling in-flight snacks.
Project Woes: The company is hemorrhaging money on fixed-price contracts and is behind schedule on a defense project for Air Force One—because apparently, building a plane fit for a president isn’t easy.

Kelly’s Game Plan

Ortberg, who previously led aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, is expected to bring a much-needed fresh perspective to Boeing. His mission: ramp up production of the 737 Max from ~25 jets per month to 38 by year’s end, all while keeping the company afloat. Boeing even waived its mandatory retirement age to bring in Ortberg, banking on his 64 years of wisdom to steer the company back on course.

But let’s be clear: Ortberg has his work cut out for him. With a potential September strike looming, a defense business that’s limping along, and a commercial division struggling to regain the trust of regulators and the public, Boeing’s turnaround isn’t going to be a smooth flight.

On The Horizon

The Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell signaled a shift in priorities yesterday, emphasizing that their dual mandate—aiming for 2% inflation and maintaining high employment—may be evolving. While inflation has eased significantly this year, the Fed is now increasingly concerned about recent labor market indicators showing signs of cooling. If employment declines faster than the Fed is comfortable with, it could accelerate their decision to cut interest rates sooner rather than later, aiming to stimulate the economy and support job growth.

This means that tomorrow's Labor Department jobs report will be crucial in shaping the Fed's next steps. All eyes will be on the numbers to gauge what direction monetary policy might take next.

Before Market Open:

Exxon Mobil ($XOM) has lagged behind the broader market this year, but don’t be deceived—the oil and gas giant has plenty of strength left. With robust dividends, an attractive valuation, and the recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Exxon could be poised for a boost after its earnings announcement. Consensus estimates are $2.01 EPS on $90.99 billion in revenue.

Chevron ($CVX), like Exxon, remains a powerhouse in the energy sector, steadily moving forward. Investors will be keen to hear updates on the planned acquisition of Hess and the status of oil production in the Permian Basin, a key asset for the company. Consensus estimates are $2.93 EPS on $50.79 billion in revenue.

After Market Close:

AMC Entertainment Holdings ($AMC) might be a favorite among meme stock enthusiasts, but beneath the surface, the picture isn’t as rosy. The company is grappling with high debt, falling revenue, and ongoing unprofitability, which has led analysts to universally avoid recommending the stock. However, in the unpredictable world of meme stocks, all it takes is a few viral posts on Reddit for AMC to surge. Consensus estimates are -$0.47 EPS on $1.04 billion in revenue.

2607,Summa Silver Corp. (SSVR.v) Prepares for Major Drilling Program Amid Rising Silver Market Potential (Article Summary + DD) ,"Several factors could contribute to a significant rise in silver prices as highlighted in the article below. The abnormally high gold/silver price ratio, which suggests that silver is currently undervalued relative to gold. Meanwhile, rising industrial demand for silver is exerting further upward pressure on prices. Technological advancements are also playing a crucial role, as they drive increased usage of silver across various industries. Furthermore, speculative investment from major market players, similar to past moves by investors like Warren Buffett, could trigger a rapid rally in silver prices, pushing them beyond what market fundamentals alone would typically suggest.



https://www.benzinga.com/opinion/24/07/40019315/four-reasons-silver-soars-in-2024



Summa Silver Corp. (Ticker: SSVR.v or SSVRF for US traders), is working to address future silver demand with its silver exploration projects in New Mexico and Nevada. 



SSVR's Hughes Project is located in the historic Tonopah mining district in Nevada, renowned for its rich silver and gold production since its discovery in 1900. The district produced 175 million ounces of silver and 1.86 million ounces of gold from 8.8 million tons of rock over several decades. 



The Hughes Project boasts several key highlights, including high-grade silver-gold (Ag-Au) mineralization discovered through recent drilling campaigns. Significant intercepts from 2020 and 2021 include grades as high as 3,971 g/t AgEq over 2.8 meters. The mineralization occurs within a 6.5 km trend, with several zones showing Ag equivalents greater than 1,000 g/t, and many targets remain untested.

SSVR's Mogollon Project is situated 120 km from Silver City in southwestern New Mexico. This project encompasses a significant silver-gold bearing epithermal vein field within the historic Mogollon district. The district was a notable silver producer between 1904 and 1925, with reported production of 13.1 million ounces of silver and 271,000 ounces of gold from 1.39 million tons of rock. 



The project's Queen Vein Target is notable for its poorly explored to completely unexplored veins, with significant potential for further mineralization surrounding historically productive high-grade mines. 



SSVR recently reviewed high potential targets at the Mogollon Project and announced its plans for a resource-style drill program to explore the Queen Vein. 



The company is in the final stages of preparing detailed plans and budgets for an upcoming drilling program, scheduled to commence next quarter. The goal is to systematically explore and define the mineralized zones, gathering essential data for future resource estimates.



Through this initiative, Summa Silver intends to advance the Mogollon Project, capitalizing on its high-grade silver and gold potential to support future growth and development.

2608,"Stock Market Recap Today 08/02/24 : The Market Just Flipped The Script + earnings recap of AAPL, AMZN, INTC, CVNA + what to watch for next week","For the third consecutive week, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slid further, while the Dow broke its four-week winning streak. The Nasdaq reached its lowest point since May, the S&P 500 dipped back to levels last seen in June, and the Dow took a staggering 989-point plunge at one point, marking its worst trading day since September 2022.

Market volatility surged, with the VIX spiking to an 18-month high up 25.82%, driven by fears of a recession following a disappointing jobs report.

Snap ($SNAP) nosedived 26.93% after warning that revenue might hit the low end of its expected range, even as monthly active users grew.

Winners & Losers

What’s up 📈

VSee Health ($VSEE) surged an astonishing 74.90% after unveiling its new robot designed to assist patients in intensive care units.

Clorox ($CLX) climbed 7.42%, with investors focusing on its strong bottom line despite disappointing sales.

Trump Media & Technology ($DJT) soared 7.39% following the rollout of its new streaming strategy.

GoDaddy ($GDDY) spiked 6.96% after the company raised its full-year revenue guidance.

Cloudflare ($NET) advanced 6.81% on the back of a strong earnings beat and raised guidance.



What’s down 📉

Booking Holdings ($BKNG) dipped 9.17% after reporting fewer room nights booked than analysts had anticipated.

Micron Technology ($MU) fell 8.68%, leading semiconductor stocks lower today.



❗️The Market Just Flipped the Script

For the last couple of years, we’ve been living in an upside-down world where bad economic news was actually good news for investors. The logic? If the economy looked rough, the Fed might ease up on those pesky interest rates. But now, we’re back in the real world—bad news is just…well, bad.

Let’s talk numbers: The latest employment data is out, and it's not pretty. Unemployment has crept up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Employers added a measly 114,000 jobs in July, a far cry from last year’s monthly average of 251,000. It’s like expecting fireworks and getting a sparkler.

But wait—there's a twist. Some experts are saying that the rise in unemployment is due to temporary layoffs, so this could just be a blip rather than the beginning of a downward spiral. Still, the S&P 500 ($SPY) didn’t take the news lightly, dropping around 2% in what might be the biggest market slump over jobs data in two years.

The Fed’s Tightrope Walk Just Got Trickier

If you’re scratching your head wondering why the market had a meltdown over a job report, here’s the tea: Investors are spooked that the Fed might have overdone it with the rate hikes. The delicate balance between cooling inflation and keeping the economy afloat is starting to look more like a juggling act with one too many balls.

Here’s where it gets juicy: Just yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. But with this latest job data, economists are now betting the Fed might have to slash rates even deeper than anticipated. Think of it as the Fed hitting the brakes a little too late, and now everyone’s bracing for a bumpy ride.

Despite the drama, analysts are urging investors to keep calm and carry on. Volatility might be making a comeback, but that’s par for the course as the Fed gets ready to shift gears.

In short, the market’s mood just did a 180, and we’re all buckled in for whatever comes next.

Earnings Olympics: Winners and Losers

This week’s earnings reports felt like a high-stakes competition, with some companies nailing their routines while others took a tumble. Let’s take a look at who’s bringing home the gold and who’s licking their wounds.

Intel’s Bad Day

Intel ($INTC) had a week so rough, it could use a hug. The chipmaker saw its stock nosedive by 26.06%—its worst single-day performance since the Nixon era—after missing earnings expectations left and right. Revenue fell short at $12.83 billion versus the anticipated $12.98 billion, and EPS was a jaw-dropping 80% lower than expected at just $0.02. To top it off, Intel announced a 15% workforce reduction, meaning 15,000 employees are getting the pink slip.

Apple Bites Back

On the flip side, Apple ($AAPL) kept the doctor away with some solid numbers. The tech giant reported $85.78 billion in revenue, outpacing expectations of $84.38 billion, and EPS hit $1.40, beating the $1.34 forecast. iPhone sales made up nearly half of Apple’s total revenue, but the real MVP was the iPad, with sales skyrocketing 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion.

Amazon’s Mixed Bag

Amazon ($AMZN) gave investors a rollercoaster ride, plunging 8.78% despite a mostly solid report. The company missed on revenue, pulling in $147.98 billion compared to the $148.76 billion expected, but managed to beat EPS estimates with $1.26 versus the anticipated $1.02. While its ad business grew 20%, it still didn’t meet the $13 billion sales target, clocking in at $12.8 billion.

Carvana’s Comeback

Carvana ($CVNA) was the comeback kid of the week, with shares surging after an earnings surprise. The online car dealer reported an EPS of $0.39, smashing the expected loss of -$0.12. Revenue also cruised past expectations at $3.41 billion, up 15% from last year. The cherry on top? Carvana sold 101,000 vehicles this quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year.



Microsoft’s AI Miss

Microsoft ($MSFT) had a mixed day, staying mostly on target but missing the mark on AI. The tech titan reported EPS of $2.95, barely above the expected $2.94, and revenue of $64.73 billion, edging out the $64.44 billion forecast. However, its “intelligence” cloud revenue, which includes its AI efforts, came in at $28.5 billion, just shy of the $28.7 billion target, leaving investors less than thrilled.

In the chaotic world of earnings, one slip can send stocks tumbling, while nailing the numbers keeps you in the winner's circle.



On The Horizon

What’s Coming Next Week:

After a rollercoaster of economic announcements, next week is shaping up to be a much-needed breather. We’ll get a few data points—July ISM services on Monday, June trade balance on Tuesday, and June consumer credit on Wednesday—but nothing that’s likely to shake the market’s foundation.

However, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims report is the one to watch. Given how this week’s job numbers rattled investors, these reports are becoming key indicators for where the market might head next.



Earnings to Watch:

With 70% of the S&P 500 having already spilled the tea on their quarterly earnings, and Big Tech mostly out of the way, you’d think we could relax. But no, there are still some big names reporting next week that you’ll want to keep an eye on:

Monday: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Hims & Hers Health ($HIMS), Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), The Carlyle Group ($CG)

Tuesday: Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

Wednesday: Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

Thursday: Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

Friday: Hawaiian Electric Industries ($HE), Getty Images ($GETY), Canopy Growth ($CGC), Soho House & Co. ($SHCO)

2610,Introducing Captchacoin: The worlds first proof of human work cryptocurrency,"Hey Crypto Enthusiasts and Future CaptchaCoin Pioneers,

We are thrilled to unveil CaptchaCoin.net, a revolutionary cryptocurrency that pioneers the concept of proof-of-human-work. Designed to democratize mining and distribution, CaptchaCoin ensures that everyone, not just a few, can benefit from the power of cryptocurrency.

What is CaptchaCoin?

CaptchaCoin is built on the foundation of proof-of-human-work, a groundbreaking approach that makes mining and participating in our network accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems, CaptchaCoin verifies legitimate human users through captchas, making mining straightforward and equitable.

Key Features:

	1.	Caps and Logs:
	•	The main unit of currency is the Cap, with a fixed supply of 1 billion. Symbol $CAPS
	•	Logs are a secondary unit mined alongside Caps, tied permanently to your wallet, and cannot be traded.

	2.	Proof of Human-Work:
	•	Captchas ensure that only real humans can mine Caps, promoting fairness and accessibility.
	•	CaptchaCoin secures the network through human interaction, preventing industrial-scale mining.

	3.	User-Friendly and Versatile:
	•	Quick Caps: Enable microtransactions for accessing content, perfect for news sites and content creators.
	•	Easy Invoicing: Set up stores and accept payments with minimal technical skills.

	4.	Social Media Verification:
	•	Use your Logs to verify social media comments, ensuring genuine human interaction and reducing spam.

Tools for Content Creators:

CaptchaCoin makes it easy to send small amounts of Caps online, making it ideal for digital creators to get rewarded for their work.

	The Simple Paywall:
	•	Any digital content can be placed behind a CaptchaCoin Simple Paywall. Users solve a CaptchaCoin captcha before viewing the content, with 100% of the mined Caps going directly to your wallet.

	•	Since it only takes a matter of seconds to solve a captcha with no direct financial cost to the user, this should result in a high conversion rate. This innovative approach to monetizing content means creators can receive a small reward from the vast majority of their userbase.

	•	A tipping wallet allows any user to mine Caps for anyone else in a secure manner. A wallet can be created on behalf of a content creator, but to prevent scammers, only the named individual can redeem the Caps.

	•	Much like the Simple Paywall, the tipping wallet has a very low threshold for the average user to contribute, encouraging a higher level of donations than traditional options.

Small Block Mining:

CaptchaCoin will offer two forms of mining and two types of blocks. Small block mining will be sequential, meaning many miners attempt to solve the same captchas, and only the fastest miner will gain the block rewards.

This means small block miners will need a higher expected return from mining to account for the increased uncertainty. This will be tested by offering a range of different mining success rates and reward multipliers to determine the correct ratio:

	•	10% chance to successfully mine, 12.5x reward (expected return: 1.25x)

	•	1% chance to successfully mine, 150x reward (expected return: 1.5x)

	•	0.1% chance to successfully mine, 2000x reward (expected return: 2x)

Unsuccessful attempts to mine will result in 0 Caps earned, 0 logs, and will not reset your ‘last mined’ timer for daily rewards.

Mining Difficulty Levels:

Increase the number of Captchas shown to mine more Caps per solve:

	•	8 Captchas shown
	•	16 Captchas shown
	•	32 Captchas shown
	•	64 Captchas shown

Enter the CaptchaCoin Lottery for the chance to win! 

Proof of Human Work

CaptchaCoin is secured through proof of human-work. The Captchas are designed to be impossible for machines to solve, but very simple for humans: users simply identify the image displaying 3 letters which have been distorted, then input these characters. Correctly solving a Captcha directly secures the network by contributing to block validation. In order to control the network, it will be necessary to have a majority of man-hours, which is impossible in a highly distributed network.

Pre-launch

Many cryptocurrencies today use proof-of-work, which gives the vast majority of power to a small number of miners operating on an industrial scale. It is almost impossible for the average user to mine any currency or influence the network. The common alternative, proof-of-stake, ensures existing currency holders control the network and typically receive additional financial benefits. Newcomers to the network are often at a severe disadvantage to the early adopters.

CaptchaCoin’s use of proof of human-work balances the playing field: all users are equal independent of the computational power they have or their existing balance. This will ensure a large network that will continually grow with new users who can easily mine their own Caps.

The Captchas are designed solely for the use of securing the CaptchaCoin network - they are not used anywhere else on the internet. A key feature in their design is scalability. Any given Captcha can be made instantly harder by expanding the range of possible solutions the user has to choose from, meaning the same amount of human-work can be captured using fewer computing resources.

In the future, it will be essential that new Captchas are generated in a way that prevents anyone from knowing their solution. They will be created randomly to ensure no one person can pre-determine them, using an independently verified machine to prove their solution is destroyed after their creation.

Rollout Overview

CaptchaCoin’s mission is to become a global currency used to facilitate day-to-day transactions both online and offline. The vast majority of people do not own a single crypto token as mining is too technologically difficult, or they are not willing to risk their money to acquire any. Proof of human-work mining removes these barriers to entry entirely.

This uniquely accessible, equitable approach to mining will create the perfect environment for a rapidly growing userbase, though this process will take many years. Below we will outline how this will be achieved by expanding CaptchaCoin’s network, features, and usability.

Phase 0: Proof of Concept
Initial features will be extremely limited, and the very early adopters mining during this stage will be those genuinely interested in the concept of CaptchaCoin and proof of human-work. Minor parts of the blockchain will be phased in, and prototypes of novel use-cases will be introduced. There will be no marketing or efforts to expand the userbase, though some growth through word-of-mouth is expected.

This phase will last until 5% of the pre-launch Caps have been mined.

Phase 1: Technological Upgrades
Throughout this phase, there will be regular rollouts of the underlying blockchain technology with a corresponding increase in functionality. Blocks will be issued every minute and will contain all of the transactions and records from a standard blockchain, though it will not be possible for users to create their own blocks - this will still be centrally controlled. Features and use-cases will be refined and made ready for a wider, non-technical audience. As these are developed, CaptchaCoin will be shared with existing crypto-enthusiasts through existing online channels. CaptchaCoin will begin to have a social media presence.

This phase will continue until 10% of pre-launch Caps have been mined. It is important to note that during the early phases, the price of a Cap can only increase - by design the price is set intentionally low and there are no mechanisms for it to decrease.

Phase 2: Expanding the Userbase
The final elements of the blockchain technology will be released, thereby establishing CaptchaCoin as a “true” cryptocurrency, which will allow for initial conversations with exchanges to list Caps. During this phase, it is essential to expand the userbase to those not traditionally involved in crypto. CaptchaCoin will have established use-cases for fee-free low-value transactions, including indirect payment through mining to a non-technical audience, giving it a considerable advantage over all other cryptocurrencies.

Phase 3: Launch
CaptchaCoin will be listed on exchanges and during this stage, there will be very high price volatility. Because of the initial mining structure, there is an expectation that the wallets with the highest number of Caps will be held by early adopters that are invested for the long term and will not instantly dump their Caps, but naturally, there will be a lot of unknowns during this time.

Phase 4: Consistent Growth
At launch, fewer than 10% of all Caps will have been mined and CaptchaCoin will have reached but a fraction of its potential userbase. CaptchaCoin will continue to achieve growth by delivering practical use-cases that encourage growth both online and offline. We are currently at the first step on a journey of a 1,000 miles and we hope you’ll join us.

Join Us on This Journey:

We are at the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency with CaptchaCoin, and we want you to be part of it. By mining Caps during our pre-launch phase, you can be among the first to experience and benefit from our unique approach.

+ Fed faces the heat + earnings for this week","* This past week in the markets was a rollercoaster ride, with a mix of optimism and sharp declines. The week started on a positive note for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, propelled by anticipation of tech earnings, while the Dow struggled to keep up. However, the tide quickly turned as tech stocks saw a significant selloff ahead of major earnings reports, dragging the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower.

# 🍎 Buffett Takes a Massive Bite Out of Apple — Slashing His Biggest Stake In Half

Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, just made a move that’s got everyone scratching their heads—he slashed Berkshire Hathaway’s ($AAPL) stake in Apple by nearly 50%. That’s right, the man who’s famous for his buy-and-hold strategy just went on a selling spree, chopping his beloved Apple shares down to $84.2 billion. But when you're Warren Buffett, even after cutting back, you're still holding a pretty hefty portion.

# Apple Picking in a Bull Market

So, why did the Oracle suddenly go on a tech diet? Back in May, Buffett hinted that a bit of Apple selling might make sense if capital gains taxes were on the rise. But this isn’t just a small trim—it’s a full-blown pruning. Apple shares surged by 23% in the second quarter, riding the wave of investor excitement over artificial intelligence. With Apple’s stock flying high, Buffett seized the moment to cash in, perhaps seeing a rare opportunity to capitalize on the tech giant’s lofty valuation.

Berkshire’s Apple sell-off is part of a broader trend. The company unloaded more than $75 billion in equities last quarter, boosting its cash reserves to a record-breaking $277 billion. That’s the financial equivalent of stockpiling for winter—Buffett’s clearly preparing for something, or maybe just playing it safe with a market that’s been a bit too hot to handle.

# Berkshire’s Defensive Play

Buffett’s been tightening his belt across the board. Alongside Apple, he’s been downsizing his second-largest holding, Bank of America ($BAC), shedding $3.8 billion worth of shares in a mere 12 days. And it’s not just about cashing out—it’s about making sure Berkshire isn’t overexposed if things go south. By trimming these top holdings, Buffett is spreading out risk, ensuring that no single stock dominates Berkshire’s portfolio.

Even with all the selling, Buffett’s love for Apple hasn’t waned. It remains Berkshire’s largest stock position, and the 93-year-old investor has praised the iPhone maker for its strong pricing power and loyal customer base. But this sell-off suggests that Buffett might be taking a more cautious stance, preparing for potential turbulence in the market—or just making sure Berkshire’s cash pile is ready for whatever opportunities or challenges lie ahead.

# What’s Next for the Oracle?

So, what’s driving Buffett’s sudden shift from stocks to cash? Analysts speculate that Buffett could be getting nervous about the U.S. economy or stock market valuations that are starting to look a little frothy. After all, the S&P 500 has been on a tear, reaching new heights as investors bet on a “soft landing” for the economy. But with a weaker-than-expected jobs report and rising concerns about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, Buffett’s cautious approach might just be the right call.

Buffett’s long-time strategy has been to hold onto great companies for the long haul, and Apple has been one of his crown jewels. But with nearly half of that jewel now polished off and Berkshire sitting on a mountain of cash, it’s clear that Buffett is ready for whatever comes next—whether it’s a market correction, a buying opportunity, or just a little more peace of mind in uncertain times.

In true Buffett fashion, the Oracle has played his cards close to the vest, leaving us all guessing what his next move might be. But one thing’s for sure—when Warren Buffett makes a move, the world pays attention.

# Fed Faces Heat After Disappointing July Jobs Report

July’s scorching heat didn’t just make your weekend plans unbearable—it also put a damper on the U.S. job market. Last month’s job growth took a nosedive, adding just 114,000 jobs, a far cry from the 185,000 expected by economists. And with the unemployment rate inching up to 4.3%—its highest since October 2021—everyone’s looking at the Fed and asking, ""What’s the hold-up?""

# The Job Market’s Report Card: A Solid D+

If the U.S. job market had to bring home its July report card, let’s just say there wouldn’t be any celebratory pizza dinners. With only 114,000 jobs added, the numbers were well below what anyone was hoping for. This sluggish growth, coupled with a rise in unemployment, has triggered the Sahm Rule—a recession signal that economists definitely didn’t want to see flashing red right now.

But not everyone’s hitting the panic button. Claudia Sahm, the economist behind the rule, argues that we’re not necessarily plunging into a recession just yet. Unusual economic conditions, including the lingering effects of the pandemic, have skewed the numbers. So, while the job market’s cooling off, it’s not quite time to batten down the hatches.

# Powell Under Pressure: Time to Cut Rates?

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell might want to rethink his summer vacation plans. After the Fed opted not to cut interest rates at its latest meeting, Powell hinted that a September rate cut was possible—if more data suggested inflation was under control. But with July’s job report looking lackluster, critics are wondering how much more data Powell needs before taking action.

Wall Street wasn’t happy either. The Dow plunged over 900 points, and the S&P 500 had its worst reaction to a jobs report in nearly two years. Senator Elizabeth Warren didn’t hold back, either, tweeting that Powell should “cut rates now—not wait six weeks.”

Looking ahead, the market is so confident in an upcoming rate cut that you’d think it’s already in the bag. Citigroup and JPMorgan are even betting on half-point cuts in both September and November. If Powell needed a push to make a move, July’s job report might just be it.

# On The Horizon

# This Week

After a turbulent week filled with economic announcements, next week appears set to offer a bit of relief. While a few data releases—such as July's ISM services on Monday, June's trade balance on Tuesday, and June's consumer credit on Wednesday—are on the calendar, none are expected to significantly impact the market. The spotlight, however, will be on Thursday's initial jobless claims report. Given how this week's job figures shook investor confidence, these reports are now critical in signaling the market’s potential direction.

2618,Jensen Huang leads innovation with the open source; WiMi company steadily grows driven by AI strategy,"Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta(META), met with Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang at the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference in Denver.

Before the conversation, Jensen Huang showed off a series of Nvidia’s latest products at the conference and announced, “Nvidia will start sending Blackwell samples this week, the new chip architecture the company launched this year.”

According to Nvidia, the Blackwell GPU improves training performance four times compared to the previous Hopper H100 GPU, reasoning performance up to 30 times, and energy efficiency 25 times. In the future, it will vigorously promote the iterative evolution of the large model industry.



**Open source big model burst of potential**

And Zuckerberg shared Meta’s progress in generative AI, noting that the development of the underlying models is accelerating. Just last week, Meta released its Llama 3.1 series models, available in three sizes: 8B, 70B, and 405B. Llama 3.1 405B is known as the most powerful open-source model in the world, and its strength is comparable to the mainstream closed-source large models such as GPT.

In addition, Zuckerberg announced the launch of a new tool called AI Studio, built based on the company’s latest big model, Llama 3.1, that allows users to create, share, and design personalized AI chatbots. In the generative AI ecology, AI Studio is an important step for Meta to promote the iterative improvement of the AI chatbot, and the Llama 3.1 model behind it is crucial.

While appreciating Meta’s exploration of AI, Jensen Huang said that generative AI is undergoing a fundamental transformation in every field, and the Llama 3.1 open-source model marks a critical moment for global enterprises to adopt generative AI. Llama 3.1 will set off a wave of enterprises and industries to create advanced generative AI applications.

From the perspective of the development path of Nvidia and Meta, neither has foreseen the development trend of AI to some extent, but now they have achieved rapid development in the new stage with the layout around AI. In particular, Nvidia has soared to the top three global market capitalizations.

 

W**iMi steadily innovates its core technology**

At the same time, the data shows that under the new wave of generative AI technology, WiMi Hologram (NASDAQ: WIMI), the world’s leading AI technology manufacturer, fully itself to AI technology and integrates AI into almost all products of productivity software such as search engines. Relying on the strong innovation gene, through basic technology innovation and deep industrial cooperation, WiMi and many partners continue to deepen the cooperation process, jointly enabling the development of AI.

WiMi has always been heavily invested in AI infrastructure. In addition to text generation and video generation, it can also provide video generation with pictures, and realize plot creation and short video AI creation through picture videos, to bring continuous upgrading experience to players. In addition, WiMi has built a perfect computing power platform to create high-performance intelligent computing power. Through the integrated service system of high-quality data, high-performance computing power, software and hardware adaptation, model evaluation, industrial application, and other integrated service systems, it comprehensively facilitates the iterative innovation of artificial intelligence technology.

Under the growth trend of the industry, the wave of AI also catalyzes the accelerated development of digital intelligent transformation, and the transformation of the digital economy led by AI + will also give birth to a new round of development opportunities for intelligent revolution. Therefore, looking into the future, WiMi will continue to enhance competitiveness with the potential energy of AI technology, enhance business strength, give full play to the advantages of innovative technology and ecological cooperation, and invest heavily in cloud and AI-related infrastructure to meet more growing demand.

 

**To sum up**

At present, the AI era has arrived, the big models are constantly iterated and upgraded, the AI application is developing rapidly, and the development potential of the AI industry is being released rapidly. Therefore, the AI concept has become a high prosperity track with long-term growth. As CITIC Securities pointed out, in the background of the establishment of the recovery trend + the arrival of the arrival of the innovation inflection point, we are optimistic about the fundamental improvement of the “short-term continued recovery + medium-and long-term end-side AI volume” of the consumer electronics sector, focusing on the end-side AI opportunities.",1722844980,830222,Oops-cat,t2_o2dpzoe30,c37696ba6fceb1adc4dd62b2be31e6d958031467a780b73d097f1237fa9caaaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ekiaex/jensen_huang_leads_innovation_with_the_open/

2631,"Bears Rule Pre-Market… While The Bulls Rule Intraday Again… 8-5-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Today was very similar to Friday and honestly I think 99% of the world were caught off guard by the incredible near limit down on futures pre market which led to an even bigger and more impressive than Friday recovery. It is truly not every day you see NQ drop 1000 pts let alone see Nq rally over 800 pts in the same day… truly some historical moves here. I will tell you what though… with back to back incredible and historical move up on the VIX… I am shocked especially today that we did not get a circuit breaker… granted -5% on NQ is pretty darn close… I am very much so surprised but the unrelenting buying.

We got quite a bit to unpack here so lets get into it…

https://preview.redd.it/fl61mlewkwgd1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb4baddac57fe66ef4b27fab733e37a2f8e4ddb9

The big question right now is are we entering a recession or not… if we are Not in a recession than historically speaking we could still be in this bull run and could see new ATHs despite rate cuts… however, if we are in a recession which from a lot of metrics it sure looks like we are then a year post first rate cuts markets historically are down 12%... From current levels that would lead to a bear market…

https://preview.redd.it/8s2ibkswkwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0d991b0e22d2e9292a48c413d3c12d73abc348

This chart above shows a more detailed view of that breakdown here… soft vs hard landing.

https://preview.redd.it/2oe1rp3xkwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8bd99ac10dde0f0dc39111984e3927bae8e725a

Now on a not so bearish case here… historically speaking when we have some a incredible 3 day move on the VIX… one, three and 6 months later historically the market has traded higher 75% of the time.

 

https://preview.redd.it/oojoi8hxkwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=24e7e3cf2f589b66ce4f444a572b890b9035b433

Just another chart here showing the precedence a three week VIX spike like this not only brings but how on average markets find themselves higher NOT lower most of the time… not all is as bearish as it may seem… unless you know this times different?

The trend as of late is short from 6pm till about 830am and then long from 830am till 2pm… will the trend hold? Will bulls get a green relief day?

https://preview.redd.it/dwqirisxkwgd1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d5970a3a90cf9801dbd897d4894930330f6bc2

I really didn’t think I would be referencing this so fast… but Es, QQQ and NQ have all officially hit market CORRECTION levels… SPY is the only one that has not officially hit it just yet. SPY needs about another $1.5 from todays LOD.

The bigger story is the fact that at todays LOD NQ was only 564 points from entering a bear market… for reference from todays LOD that is only another 3.3% drop… ES, however, from todays low has a bigger cushion of about 543 points or about 10% more of a drop.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/rkesht2ykwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6ff6f2c13ad7f0b3a065d4a2bf06f4f35d76e1

This is honestly one of the ugliest and just wildest looking daily charts and candle patterns ive seen in a very long time. This massive $20 gap down on SPY that was attempted to completely gap fill only to be sold back off… Not only did SPY finally lose the daily 100ema support (red line) but it also completely turned it into resistance all in one swift move.

The only interesting thing here I can see is that we actually have weaker daily sellers here than we did yesterday despite an obviously extremely red day here… the other more surprising thing is that we have not fully entered extreme bear momentum yet.

We are now sandwiched inside of two major areas… the daily 100ema resistance at 528.93 with our double demand resistance at 520.82-522.61. We then have the daily 200ema support down at 505.94 with a demand at 504.16.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 550.95  
Demand- 504.16 -> 520.82 -> 522.61 -> 533.59

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/peqrqidykwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c9d5411c922963151985267d791697e3ab82559

The beauty of futures is it shows a better and more clear picture at time. While we still had a very impressive gap down at open last night… you can see the levels of which we are stuck in between more clearly…

The daily 100ema at 5342 which is just below key 5353 demand is a perfect and strong resistance area that bulls need to take back.

I am honestly despite the ridiculous heights the VIX went to this morning not terribly surprised to see such massive buying off the daily 200ema support here on ES. That 200ema support at 5107 is the bulls last stand in my opinion before a bear market is preliminarily confirmed. Below this 4989-5049 is the next critical demands/ supports to watch.  
ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5570  
Demand- 4989 -> 5049 -> 5239 -> 5251 -> 5353

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/mc0hshqykwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bea7457272860d2a17d6ccde270a705ea5b41e

QQQ has just as ugly of a pattern as we do on SPY after the also very impressive $24 gap down over the weekend. Much like SPY we do actually have weaker daily sellers here despite the 3% red day we got and seeing at times -5% on QQQ. Now on QQQ though we ARE in extreme daily bear momentum which means for the short term futures any pop to the upside until the daily 8ema resistance is reclaimed is a short opportunity.

We have already lost the daily 200ema support here on QQQ. However, I would not be surprised to see a multi day long fight and battle for this area and support. Again loosing and holding under this support likely is our precurser to the bear market…

From here you can see 425.36 is our critical demand/ support to watch for bulls to defend. Bears must defend 442 demand and resistance also.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 411.52 ->471.06  
Demand- 414.53 -> 425.36 -> 442 -> 450.65

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/yz8dh92zkwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae41254f445f248f67e4ff2ae964c4f4371bd5f1

Much like ES we are able to see a much clearer picture here on NQ. The daily 8/ 100ema have bearishly crossed under for the first time since October 2023. The bears were able to take this all the way down to 17180-17461 double demand/ support but were unable to break and hold those levels. That is the major level bears must conquer next.

From here like I said the daily 200ema at 17933 is likely to be a multi day fight historically speaking (much like what we saw at the 100ema). Bulls ideally must reclaim the daily 8ema near 18500 to be in control again.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 16981 -> 19585  
Demand- 17180 -> 17461 -> 18234 -> 18594 -> 18892

**VIX DAILY**

Today was once again an even more incredible wick on the VIX… the VIX reaching 65.73 is truly incredible and is a feat that was not even done during the 2022 bear market. The VIX hit its highest levels today since the COVID crash.

https://preview.redd.it/8gpl3yqzkwgd1.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ef9ffac22da171d9546d5e6768180428dc19d2e

Not too long ago when the VIX was still in the teens a cup and handle presented itself… what I did NOT anticipate was that the cup and handle was not that from April 2024 but that from the 2020 COVID crash…

https://preview.redd.it/mib82181lwgd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1546584f9b198ae411b78be324bfea4822fe9d40

Could this cup and handle have more to go? Can we see the VIX break 80? Is 65.73 VIX the new recent high?

I was quite delayed today in getting my new funded accounts after a rough end to last week. I honestly am happy that happened as I was very much so looking for downside once again this morning and that 800pt NQ rally would have not been very fun to trade…

I woke up around 4am and saw what the VIX and market was doing and decided not to go back to bed and sat down to enjoy the show… honestly the pre market trading was incredibly nice and allowed me to pass two evals pretty easily.

I ended up after finally getting my funded around 2pm found two nice short opps that led to some great wins for two of my accounts. Unfortunately I got chewed up by volatility in my third account.

Overall a great way to start the week off.",1722888824,830331,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,4ac5e012f6b89146721711b413be73c2dea6746d5f39e6ae7b4d04bb8816ad2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ekxv6u/bears_rule_premarket_while_the_bulls_rule/

2633,Stock Market Recap 08/05/2024: Global Market Selloff + Wallstreet's message + Palantir Earnings,"* It was a brutal day for the markets: The Nasdaq slipped into correction territory right out of the gate, the Dow took a nosedive, dropping 1,237 points early on, and the S&P 500 endured its roughest day in nearly two years. Although all three indexes clawed back some losses by midday, they stayed firmly in the red.
* Investors flocked to the safety of bonds, pushing 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest levels since June 2023, as the stock market took a beating.
* Even gold, typically the go-to safe haven, wasn’t immune—investors had to sell off their gold holdings to cover margin calls on their stock positions.

# Winners & Losers

* **Tesla** ($TSLA) decreased 4.23% amid growing concerns over the company’s global expansion, despite recent optimism from Elon Musk.

# Global Market Sell-Off —  Why Your Portfolio is Bleeding Red Today

If you’ve been checking your portfolio today, you’ve probably noticed it’s looking like a murder scene—red, red, and more red. Spoiler: It’s not just you. Investors across the globe are feeling the pain, and the culprit? Japan’s Nikkei 225, which just experienced its worst single-day drop since 1987’s Black Monday, plummeting a jaw-dropping 12.4%.

# What’s a Carry Trade, and Why Should You Care?

Let’s dive into the cause of this market madness. It all circles back to something called the “carry trade.” In simple terms, a carry trade is like borrowing money at a super low interest rate in one country—say, Japan—and then investing it in a country where returns are higher, like the U.S. For years, this has been a winning strategy for many investors, with the yen being the cheap currency of choice. Japan’s interest rates were kept ultra-low to boost exports, making it dirt-cheap to borrow yen and invest in U.S. assets, where the returns were much more attractive.

But here’s the kicker: Last week, Japan raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years. Suddenly, that dirt-cheap yen isn’t so cheap anymore. And to make matters worse, the U.S. is expected to cut rates soon, potentially making U.S. assets less attractive. The result? Investors are scrambling to unwind their carry trades, dumping assets like there’s no tomorrow—and dragging global markets down with them.

# Should You Be Worried?

So, is it time to freak out? According to analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives, the answer is no. “It’s scary, but we navigate through the turbulence,” Ives said, implying that while today’s sell-off is jarring, it’s more about fear than a sign of deeper economic trouble. In other words, this could be just another episode of market overreaction rather than the beginning of a full-blown crisis.

Sure, the U.S. jobs report last week showed weaker-than-expected hiring, raising concerns about an economic slowdown. And yes, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes have some people worried that the economy might tip into a recession. But at the end of the day, these concerns are nothing new. The market has weathered similar storms before and will likely do so again.

# The Bottom Line: Keep Calm and Carry On

Today’s market turmoil might feel like a nightmare, but it’s important to remember that volatility is part of the investing game. The global sell-off is unsettling, but for long-term investors, it’s more of a speed bump than a brick wall. If you’re invested in quality assets with strong fundamentals, today’s dip could even be seen as a buying opportunity rather than a reason to panic. So before you rush to make any drastic changes, take a deep breath and remember: the market’s ups and downs are normal. Stick to your plan, stay informed, and keep an eye on the bigger picture. The headlines today will be forgotten tomorrow, but smart investment decisions will pay off in the long run.

# Cut to the Chase — Wall Street’s Whisper

It seems Wall Street is sending a loud and clear message to the Federal Reserve: it’s time to slash those interest rates, and fast. The recent selloff on Wall Street, coupled with a lackluster jobs report, has stoked fears of an impending recession, and traders are now placing bets on more aggressive rate cuts through the rest of 2024.

# The New Rate Cut Playbook

The expectation? A half-percent cut in both September and November, followed by another quarter-point in December. This is a notable shift from the earlier forecasts, which anticipated just two quarter-point cuts before the year’s end.

JPMorgan’s chief economist, Michael Feroli, isn’t ruling out an even quicker move. He’s suggesting the Fed might act before its next scheduled meeting in mid-September, arguing that they’re “materially behind the curve.” Feroli’s calling for a 50-basis-point cut in September, followed by another in November.

# Emergency Rate Cut? Not So Fast

But not everyone is on board with a pre-meeting cut. Wilmer Stith, a bond portfolio manager at Wilmington Trust, believes such a move could spook investors, typically reserved for times of extreme crisis. While he acknowledges that “anything is possible” if market conditions deteriorate further, he doubts the Fed will make an emergency move.

Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell also downplayed the idea of a hefty 50-basis-point cut, hinting instead that a 25-basis-point trim is more likely—if the Fed decides to take action at all.

# The Jobs Report that Sparked the Fire

The pressure on the Fed ramped up last Friday when the latest jobs data showed the US economy added just 114,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, well short of the 175,000 expected. To top it off, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The weak labor market data has some Fed watchers convinced that the central bank missed the boat by not cutting rates at its last meeting.

Despite the cooling jobs market, policymakers chose to keep rates at a 23-year high in July, much to the dismay of traders who hadn’t priced in an economic slowdown.

# What’s Next for the Fed?

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee made it clear last week that the central bank wouldn’t overreact to a single report. He emphasized that there’s plenty of data to come before the Fed’s next meeting, though he did hint that if unemployment continues to rise, a policy response might be necessary.

Baird strategist Ross Mayfield chimed in, saying a 50-basis-point cut “should be on the table,” and reflecting on the Fed’s missed opportunity in July: “With hindsight, it’s clear they probably should’ve started cutting then.”

All eyes will be on Jay Powell when he takes the stage in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in a couple of weeks or whether they will intervene and hold an emergency meeting. Will he stick to his cautious approach, or will he finally bow to Wall Street’s growing calls for a more aggressive rate cut? Let’s stay tuned and see.

# Palantir’s AI Revolution: Revenue Rockets Higher

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue Forecast**: Raised to $2.74B–$2.75B (from $2.68B–$2.69B)
* **Q3 Revenue Forecast**: $697M–$701M (Analyst estimate: $679.1M)
* **Q2 Revenue**: $678M (Up 27%, Beat estimate of $652.8M)
* **Q2 Net Income**: $134M (Analyst estimate: $82.8M)
* **U.S. Commercial Sales**: $159M (Up 55%)
* **Government Sales**: $371M (Up 23%, Beat estimate of $346.6M)
* **Year-to-Date Stock Gain**: +45.3%
* **After-Hours Stock Surge**: +13.74%

# Riding the AI Wave

Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) is riding high on the AI wave, and the market is loving it. The data analytics giant has raised its annual revenue forecast—again—thanks to the growing demand for its generative AI-powered software. This has sent the stock soaring over 13% in extended trading, pushing its year-to-date gain to a hefty 39%. Not too shabby for a company that's been laser-focused on transforming businesses with AI.

# Big Profits, Bigger Expectations

The April-to-June quarter was a blockbuster for Palantir. The company posted its largest quarterly profit ever, with adjusted earnings hitting 9 cents per share, surpassing Wall Street expectations. Revenue also shot up 27% to $678 million, easily beating forecasts. And it’s not just the past that’s looking bright—Palantir expects third-quarter revenue to land between $697 million and $701 million, well above analysts’ estimates.

But it’s not just the government contracts keeping the lights on. Palantir's U.S. commercial sales jumped 55% last quarter, showing that more and more enterprise customers are turning to Palantir to navigate the tricky waters of AI integration.

# What’s Next?

Palantir’s CEO, Alex Karp, isn’t shy about where he sees the future—AI is the game-changer. In a letter to shareholders, he highlighted how the company’s AI platform, launched just over a year ago, has already ""transformed"" the business. And with U.S. military contracts piling up, Palantir’s role in defense is only growing.

The cherry on top? Palantir is eyeing a spot in the S&P 500 Index. CFO David Glazer hinted that the company’s strong performance could pave the way for this inclusion, a move that would surely keep the stock in the spotlight.

So, while the AI boom continues to fuel Palantir’s rise, the company’s strategy to expand its commercial footprint and bolster its government ties seems to be paying off big time. Investors, take note—Palantir’s just getting started.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week’s economic calendar is pretty light, and after today’s market rollercoaster, a bit of quiet might be just what we need. Tomorrow’s main event? The U.S. trade balance report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This measures the gap between what the U.S. imports and exports. Last month, the U.S. ran a deficit, meaning exports fell more than imports. While this report won’t directly impact your portfolio, it’s a key indicator of the U.S.’s role in the global economy.

But let’s be honest, the real action this week is in earnings, with a flurry of companies set to report. Here are a few names to keep an eye on tomorrow.

**Tuesday:** Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

# Before Market Open:

* **Uber (UBER)**: Uber wasn’t exactly riding high before the pandemic, struggling with profitability issues. But fast forward a few years, and the company has made a remarkable turnaround, finally reaching profitability and expanding its services. Wall Street is bullish—32 out of 33 analysts rate it a “buy,” with a target price that’s over 50% higher than its current value. Consensus: $0.31 EPS, $10.54 billion in revenue.
* **Caterpillar (CAT)**: As a barometer for the U.S. economy, Caterpillar’s performance is closely tied to construction and manufacturing activity. Given the recent struggles in the manufacturing sector, investors will be eager to hear how this has impacted Caterpillar’s business. Consensus: $5.58 EPS, $16.95 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Reddit (RDDT)**: Still a newcomer to the public markets, Reddit has only one earnings report under its belt since its IPO in March. That debut report showed some promising numbers, including record daily active users and impressive revenue growth. However, profitability remains elusive, and Reddit has been busy forging new partnerships to address investor concerns. Tomorrow’s report will shed light on how close the company is to turning a profit. Consensus: -$0.33 EPS, $253.58 million in revenue.
* **Airbnb (ABNB)**: Like Uber, Airbnb has had a turbulent post-pandemic ride. The stock soared when travel demand surged post-lockdowns, but it’s since come back down as travel spending stabilized. Investors are now looking for signs that consumers are still booking stays, despite ongoing regulatory challenges and travel uncertainties. The big question: Is Airbnb still a better deal than traditional hotels? Consensus: $0.90 EPS, $2.73 billion in revenue.",1722895904,830351,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,f4a7b04d83ef1d75386107fa1f98df90162e4b76c5e3bd15fc42147d16cb1f39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1el0s64/stock_market_recap_08052024_global_market_selloff/

2653,Stock Market Recap 08/06/2024: Is the selloff over? + Google Ruled Guilty in Antitrust Suit + Uber Earnings,"* Stocks are staging a solid recovery. The Dow climbed nearly 300 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq getting a lift from impressive gains in the tech sector.
* As investors shifted toward riskier assets, 10-year Treasury yields bounced back after touching their lowest level in over a year.

# Winners & Loser

# What’s up 📈

* **Lumen Technologies** ($LUMN) skyrocketed 93.05% after management reported a massive surge in new business driven by increased AI adoption.
* **Kenvue** ($KVUE) leaped 14.68% after exceeding analyst earnings expectations in the second quarter, fueled by strong sales of its well-known products like Band-Aids and Tylenol.
* **Uber** ($UBER) climbed 10.93% following a strong Q2 performance that outpaced analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue.
* **Palantir Technologies** ($PLTR) rallied 10.33% on the back of an earnings beat driven by robust AI demand.
* **CrowdStrike** ($CRWD) rebounded 4.34% after Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock, signaling 2it had bottomed out.
* **Lucid Group** ($LCID) advanced 3% after receiving a significant $1.5 billion funding boost from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

# What’s down 📉

* **Chegg** ($CHGG) plunged 22.18% despite surpassing revenue expectations in Q2, as investors reacted negatively to slower growth and a declining user base.
* **ZoomInfo Technologies** ($ZI) nosedived 18.27% after missing on both earnings and revenue targets in the second quarter.
* **Vulcan Materials** ($VMC) slipped 4.36% due to disappointing earnings, marred by weaker demand for construction materials.

# Is It Safe to Breathe Again, Investors?

If your inbox was flooded yesterday with anxious messages from friends fretting over their stock portfolios or colleagues worried about their 401(k)s, you weren’t the only one.

# Is the Storm Over?

Monday's market madness had investors around the globe in a frenzy, thanks to a perfect storm of economic jitters. The chaos started with unsettling employment data hinting that the Fed’s efforts to cool the economy might be working too well. Add to that a massive unwind of a popular carry trade in Japan and some AI-related profit-taking, and you had a recipe for a sea of red in the markets.

But just as quickly as the losses came, they started to fade. Tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft, which were among the biggest losers yesterday, have already bounced back into positive territory.

# Staying Steady in Unsteady Times

So, is the storm over? Not so fast. While yesterday's selloff seemed more about fear than fundamentals, the broader economic landscape remains shaky. The Fed hasn’t budged on interest rates yet, despite growing speculation that they’ll roll out a hefty rate cut in September to calm things down.

Wall Street pros are warning that we’re likely in for more turbulence before any rate cuts materialize. And though a half-point cut seems to be the consensus, these are the same folks who predicted six rate cuts at the start of the year—so take their forecasts with a grain of salt.

# The Takeaway?

Don’t let market swings scare you into cashing out. Analysts stress that volatility is no reason to hit the eject button, especially after the strong gains we've seen this year. A little bumpiness is par for the course.

And if we’re not at the market’s bottom yet, this might just be the chance to buy into sectors like AI, which have been sky-high in recent months.

In short, hang tight and keep your cool.There are plenty of other things to lose sleep over, like whether your favorite streaming service is about to hike prices again or why that meme stock you bought for fun is suddenly your biggest holding.

# Market Movements

* Tesla ($TSLA) is set to fix 1.7 million vehicles in China, according to the Market Regulator.
* Uber ($UBER) reported a 16% YoY revenue increase in Q2, surpassing analysts' estimates.

* Groq, a startup producing chips to power AI models, raised $640M in a new funding round, bringing its total to over $1B with a $2.8B valuation.
* SunPower has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell off its assets.

# The Verdict Is In

In a ruling that could shake up the tech world, a federal judge has declared that Google ($GOOGL) is, indeed, an illegal monopoly. Judge Amit Mehta didn’t mince words, stating, “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” This is a major win for the Department of Justice, which has been chasing Google for years, accusing the tech giant of smothering competition in search and advertising.

But hold your horses—this is just the beginning. The next phase will decide what happens to Google. Will it be slapped on the wrist with a fine, or could it face a breakup? While the latter sounds juicy, it’s probably not going to happen. Google’s appealing the ruling, so this could drag out longer than your latest Netflix binge.

# Big Tech's Turn in the Hot Seat

Google isn’t the only tech giant sweating right now. Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), and Meta ($META) are all facing similar antitrust scrutiny. Regulators argue that these companies have been acting like playground bullies, pushing around smaller rivals and favoring their own products. The Google ruling could set the stage for how these cases unfold, but whether it’ll lead to actual change remains to be seen.

# Investors Hit Snooze

While the ruling is big news, investors don’t seem too concerned. Alphabet’s stock dipped a bit with the rest of the market but quickly bounced back. Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives aren’t expecting any major disruptions to Google’s operations in the near term, so it looks like business as usual—for now.

So, what’s next? We’re all just waiting to see if this ruling will actually make a dent in Google’s search dominance or if it’s just another chapter in the ongoing saga of Big Tech vs. The World.

# Uber’s Q2 Earnings Shift into High Gear

# By the Numbers

* **Earnings per share (EPS):** 47 cents (vs. 31 cents expected)
* **Revenue:** $10.7 billion (vs. $10.57 billion expected)
* **Mobility Gross Bookings:** $20.6 billion (up 23% YoY)
* **Delivery Gross Bookings:** $18.1 billion (up 16% YoY)
* **Net Income:** $1.02 billion
* **Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs):** 156 million (up 14% YoY)
* **Total Trips:** 2.77 billion (up 21% YoY)

# Zooming Past Expectations

Uber ($UBER) put the pedal to the metal in Q2, delivering earnings that sped past Wall Street’s forecasts. The company reported 47 cents per share, outpacing the expected 31 cents, while revenue came in at $10.7 billion, topping predictions. With its mobility unit seeing a 23% surge in gross bookings and delivery bookings rising 16%, Uber’s growth engine is firing on all cylinders.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was riding high, noting that Uber’s monthly active platform consumers reached 156 million, a 14% increase from last year, with 2.77 billion trips during the quarter. The market took notice, sending Uber’s stock up 10.9% following the report.

# Looking Ahead

For the third quarter, Uber is forecasting gross bookings between $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion, with adjusted earnings expected to land between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion. While the midpoint is just shy of analysts' estimates, it still signals that Uber expects to keep cruising along smoothly.

# The Road to Autonomous

Khosrowshahi didn’t shy away from addressing Tesla’s ($TSLA) potential robotaxi threat. He assured investors that Uber’s partnerships with Waymo and other AV players put it in a prime position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space. Uber’s platform, he emphasized, is unmatched in its ability to offer AV companies the scale they need without the headache of building their own network.

After a rough start to the year, Uber’s stock is gaining traction. With a focus on innovation and expansion, Uber seems ready to stay ahead in the race for the future of transportation. 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With recession jitters on the rise, all eyes are on the labor market. But while jobs bring in the cash, it’s the way Americans spend it that really tells the story. As spending slows—thanks in large part to sky-high inflation—companies start to feel the pinch, forcing McDonald’s to keep those $5 deals on the menu a bit longer.

That’s why tomorrow’s consumer credit report is so important: it’s a snapshot of not just how much people are spending, but also how much debt they’re piling up—the good (mortgages) and the not-so-good (credit cards). Normally, this report flies under the radar, but this time it could be key in shaping monetary policy in the coming months.

**Wednesday:** Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

# Before Market Open: 

* Disney ($DIS) has hit some turbulence lately, with sky-high prices at theme parks, fierce streaming competition, and cautious consumer spending weighing it down. But recent box office wins have revived some optimism, and Wall Street still believes in the Magic Kingdom: 21 out of 26 analysts rate the stock as a “buy,” with a target price about 40% higher than its current level. Consensus: $1.19 EPS, $23.05 billion in revenue.
* Shopify ($SHOP) has had a rough 2024, with its stock nosediving due to worries over slowing consumer spending, challenging economic conditions for small businesses, and declining revenue. Investors are eager for signs of a turnaround this quarter, and given the stock’s current valuation, it might just catch the eye of bargain hunters. Consensus: $0.20 EPS, $2.01 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* Robinhood ($HOOD) blew past analyst expectations last quarter, delivering an EPS of $0.18 versus the expected $0.05. Investors are crossing their fingers for a repeat performance this quarter, though volatility in digital currencies—a favorite among Robinhood traders—could put a dent in trading revenue and profits. Consensus: $0.15 EPS, $631.82 million in revenue.

2654,Vior Inc.'s (VIO.v) $22 Million Cash Position Against a $34 MCap to Drive Belleterre Gold Project Exploration in Historically Productive Gold Region ,"The gold exploration industry continues to attract significant investment and attention, particularly in regions rich in geological potential. Companies like Vior Inc. (Ticker: VIO.v, VIORF for US investors) are leading the charge, leveraging their robust financial positions to pursue promising projects that could yield substantial returns.



The Belleterre Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi-Temiscamingue region, a historically prolific area for gold mining, is the centerpiece of VIO's exploration efforts.



This ambitious district-scale initiative spans 572 square kilometers and includes the former Belleterre Gold Mine, which produced around 800,000 ounces of gold with an impressive average grade of 10.7 g/t from 1936 to 1959.

https://preview.redd.it/j0ioj9xak4hd1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=7befea65c1d0dd2c53d1038fcc0c6c4dd0c3f148



The geological setting of Belleterre is highly promising, with evidence of high-grade gold veins, exhalative Cu-Zn-Au-Ag deposits, and lithium-bearing pegmatite dykes. This extensive land package covers a substantial part of the Belleterre volcano-sedimentary belt, offering multiple avenues for discovery and resource expansion.



Numerous high-grade gold occurrences have been identified across the project area, and VIO is well-funded to explore these opportunities further. A 60,000-meter drill program, set to commence in this summer or fall, aims to tap into the significant exploration potential of the Belleterre project.



In addition to gold, the project's proximity to the advanced Tansim Lithium Project adds another layer of potential value, positioning VIO to benefit from lithium exploration as well.



Financially, Vior Inc. is in a robust position, having recently secured $21.83 million in capital, bringing their total cash reserves to nearly $22 million. This strong financial base supports the company’s market valuation of $34 million, highlighting a well-capitalized and low-risk investment profile.



With its substantial cash reserves and a strategic focus on the highly prospective Belleterre Gold Project, Vior Inc. is well-positioned to capitalize on the abundant opportunities within the gold exploration industry. As the company moves forward with its extensive drill program, it stands to deliver significant value to its shareholders, underscoring the strong investment potential within this dynamic sector.

2656,Apple’s first beta version Apple Intelligence is a hot topic; WiMi accelerates its AIGC domain layout,"On Monday (July 29), Apple inc. (AAPL) released a beta version of Apple Smart (Apple Intelligence), which is currently only available to Apple developers, allowing users to experience some of its features.



Release of the AI feature beta

According to the introduction, at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple Intelligence can play the powerful function of generative artificial intelligence model based on personal scenarios, deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, can make a variety of cross-App operations, simplify and accelerate the daily task process for users.

Apple says it is integrating ChatGPT into the iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia experiences, allowing users to use special ChatGPT features directly, saving them the trouble of switching back and forth between different tools. In addition, Siri can directly call the special functions of ChatGPT as needed.

In fact, in the past week, the pace of ChatGPT and other technologies has accelerated: Meta(META.US) released the open source model Llama3.1, which performs the top closed-source model.

According to the official report, Llama’s top models are comparable to the top basic models in the market such as GPT-4, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in various tasks. At the same time, Nvidia (NVDA) strong assist is expected to accelerate the application of generative AI in various fields around the world, which also shows that the AI “arms race” continues to upgrade.



The AI application field is prominent

At present, the AI big model track industry is rising day by day, becoming a pioneer and an important engine to promote industrial change. On July 30, QuestMobile, a well-known business intelligence data service provider, released the half-annual report of China Mobile Internet in 2024.

Among them, the AIGC APP industry stood out among all the Internet secondary industries, and the industry scale ushered in explosive growth. QuestMobile It pointed out that as all parties continue to develop native AIGC applications, as well as the major factories have built-in AI application capabilities, the AI generated application market in segmentation scenarios is developing rapidly.

In the face of this historic opportunity, CICC and Open Source Securities have studied and analyzed the development prospects of AIGC industry. AIGC industry is facing unprecedented development opportunities, and its potential and prospects have attracted much attention. Obviously, this will further intensify the intensity of competition across AI applications.

 

WiMi layout in the AIGC field

Nowadays, many enterprises have taken action to actively participate in the layout and development of AIGC industry, in order to share a share of the pie in this emerging field full of opportunities, and occupy a favorable position in the future market competition. It is understood that as WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), a technology enterprise in the AIGC field, it further clarified the strategic position of AI in the industry development, continuously explored the application of AI in various fields, and started to deploy relevant AIGC tools.

2659,"Adding Entertainment Stocks to the Screener - LiveOne, Inc. ($LVO)","Alright everyone, I mentioned LVO last night after it appeared in my screener. I typically don’t focus on the entertainment sector, but this company and their platform have caught my interest.

# Intro to LiveOne (LVO)

**LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ: LVO)** IPO’d back in 2012, but it’s only recently that they’ve transformed their LiveOne entertainment platform.

The platform offers various music options, both live and recorded, free for any user with or without an account.

Similar to Spotify and Pandora, LiveOne generates revenue from ads shown to users who haven’t subscribed to their premium options, encouraging them to become paying customers.

What’s unique compared to traditional music streaming platforms is that LiveOne offers LIVE pay-per-view events that you wouldn’t typically find through a traditional cable service. They also provide both free and subscription-based access to popular podcasts and radio streams—a platform for all-in-one entertainment.

Their platform is available on popular streaming services like Roku, AppleTV, and Amazon Fire TV.

# Market Position

LVO’s share price has been volatile over the last 12 months, but it has shown some bullish strength and consolidation lately, sitting at $1.48/share.

While they’re entering a crowded space with many companies moving to streaming platforms (like Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, etc.), the unique digital access that LiveOne offers gives them potential to make an impact in this saturated market.

In addition to ad and subscription revenue, LiveOne also has its own line of merchandise that adds to their bottom line.

# Financial Report

LiveOne’s revenue increased by 18% from their 2023 mark of $99,611, which is positive despite their EPS decline to -$0.21 from -$0.14 over the same period.

However, the company has seen significant profit growth from 2022, where their GPM increased from $24,039 to $32,049 in 2023—a notable 33% jump year over year.

# Key Highlights

* Signed an exclusive multi-year deal with celebrity medium Johnathan Mark to launch a top-tier podcast with PodcastOne, a newly acquired partner of LiveOne. This is just the beginning of their celebrity collaborations.
* LiveOne generates international engagement from markets in Asia, Europe, and beyond.
* Their library of franchises across music and podcasts continues to grow.
* Livestream demand is constantly increasing.

# My Thesis

Given the support found at their current price point on a bullish trend line, I expect LVO to climb above $1.80/share before the end of the month. Further news catalysts will be necessary, but given their position on popular streaming platforms, another celebrity collaboration could give LiveOne the momentum it needs.

I hope everyone enjoyed the read! Please do your own research and form your own thesis. Has anyone else looked into this company? Are there any other up-and-comers in the entertainment sector?

2670,"Bears Lock In The Third Failed Recovery… 8-7-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","My general analysis this week was that we would see Monday and Tuesday upside that would lead to likely Thursday being our bear day that takes us lower. I did not expect back to back days of almost 100pts of rejection on ES. This is truly a really impressive failed recovery here. This being our 3rd major failed recovery since this downtrend has started certainly makes the odds of further downside and potentially the coveted bear market even more possible. As you can see in the chart below this is an incredibly impressive downtrend markets has now found itself in.

https://preview.redd.it/9yz0nhvduahd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=14423281349a1c45d144ba417cc2f5c02edd3133

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/jb7pwf8euahd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ebe92a3dd97258c7cf34eaa7a534787d1f7fd0

A few major things to unpack here on SPY daily before we move onto ES… the first notable VERY bearish thing is the fact that yesterdays power hour sold us off just low enough to NOT get a new demand (support)… that is quite notable as todays rejection off the daily 8 and 100ema is confirmation of a failed supply/ demand recovery. As you guys know these failed recoveries are pretty major bearish moves that can play out aggressively and quickly. This week I expected the dead cat bounce to take us to the daily 8ema retest. I did not think it would do it in the nasty and disgusting price action way it did but it did finally play out… this opens up that potential for further downside here… I had mentioned on SPY the last two days we brought in weaker sellers, however, today those sellers officially came back in stronger to confirm the downside.

Bulls have a VERY clear resistance at 528.66 (daily 100ema resistance) and now 8ema at 531.14 to break through before they are even remotely in control again.

Bears have a real opportunity to take this right back down to the daily 200ema support near 506.27 by the EOW.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 550.95  
Demand- 495.06 -> 504.16 -> 520.82 -> 522.61 -> 533.59 -> 539.39

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/fw0te5keuahd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff7689e7472927012e2a31468d244c7427cb58d

ES had showed a new demand up until the final seconds of close yesterday. We also have a failed recovery here on ES and you can see two absolutely nasty and massive wicks that rejected right off the daily 100ema at 5339 and today off the daily 8ema at 5358. While we did NOT bring in stronger sellers on ES today we did officially enter extreme bear momentum. As you guys know when we are in extreme bear momentum the 8ema is the a natural mean reversion before further movement happens.

Bulls must reclaim 5339 and the 100ema.

Bears will look to break away from this double demand area of 5239-5250 and target a bigger drop down to the daily 200ema of 5110 by EOW.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5570  
Demand- 5049 -> 5239 -> 5250 -> 5436 -> 5445 -> 5450

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/1orh3gxeuahd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=350a86c71ceb182dbbe772466a7be4498f711f0c

Unlike SPY we DID get the daily demand/ support yesterday on QQQ at 424.58. This set up a new supply today to be put in at 439.46. While this is a pretty unconventional looking daily price action here on QQQ… what it really shows when you zoom out is that the daily 8ema is absolutely resistance. 449.44 and I would venture to say demand at 450.65 is very critical resistance to watch.

We again are in extreme bear momentum on the daily and we much like SPY brought in stronger daily sellers today.

From here this is where that multi-day long fight for the 200ema continues as I mentioned Monday when we first touched it. Bears must close under the 200ema and seek out a closure under 424.58 next.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 409.58 -> 411.52 -> 439.46  
Demand- 414.53 -> 424.58 -> 450.65

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

We have a bit of a different setup here on NQ… while we did get our demand at 18146 yesterday… we had closed under that support which actually gave us an imbalanced close. We attempted to close back over that level today but as you can see the bulls failed… now while the bulls failed to rebalance the market here we did NOT get a new supply (yet). However, I think it is very clear and safe to say that the daily 8ema resistance at 18588 and the daily 200ema support at 17944 are the critical break out levels for the bulls and the bears.

While I think its very fair to say at times (Especially during the most bullish times) that the VIX is broken and is unusable… when we find ourselves in a bear movement and potentially heading towards a bear market… it is incredibly useful.

One major thing to note here is that the VIX remains much like NQ imbalanced. Since our new supply at 18.61 we have not closed back below it and we have not put a new demand in just yet.

However, what we do have which I pointed out as potential yesterday is the daily 8ema and 20ema providing a nice upside bounce. The VIX certainly mid day today had a significant reversal to the upside. Bears will seek a move back over 26.17 while bulls will see to break through to the daily 20ema support at 20.08.

I finally through A LOT of patience and even more patience after that was able to put in a respectable day. I had gotten wicked out by just a few points on my morning short which proved to of course be an excellent entry before we had a major sell off… from there it was an up and down battle for two of my three accounts.

I am content with todays results and I prevented myself from over trading today. The major downside we had looked convincing to play but it was not my A+ setup and I find myself taking too many risky early entries. I am trying to slow down and take only those that are A+. With the VIX in the 20s and sometimes in the 30s it is incredibly hard to trade this market.

2673,Borealis Mining (TSXV: BOGO) - A Strategic Player in Nevada's Gold Mining Landscape,"Borealis Mining (TSXV: BOGO) stands out as a company with a clear vision and robust potential, driven by its operational-ready Borealis gold mine located in one of the world's most favorable mining jurisdictions—Nevada. With a rich history of gold production, the Borealis project has already yielded over 600,000 ounces of gold historically through conventional heap leaching, yet it remains vastly underexplored, presenting significant opportunities for further discoveries.

https://preview.redd.it/l023l7ifsbhd1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c1329a81f77e1b91874d032a905b5f424f72c7

**Strong Growth Potential and Historical Significance**

The Borealis project is not just another gold mine; it is a project steeped in history and potential. Discovered in 1978, the Borealis mine first entered production in 1981, delivering approximately \~500,000 ounces of gold from near-surface oxide deposits. Since then, minor production phases in 2011-2013 and 2021-2022 have added another \~125,000 ounces to its tally. Despite these impressive figures, the project is still in its infancy in terms of exploration. The existing resources are open for expansion, with significant high-grade exploration potential both at the surface and at depth.



**Underexplored Land Package and Expansion Potential**

Borealis Mining controls a vast 14,600-acre land package that is largely unexplored, especially since the last significant exploration activity occurred in 2012. The property, located in the Walker Lane Gold Trend offers immense potential for new discoveries. Historical geophysical surveys have identified numerous undrilled high-priority targets, which Borealis is now poised to explore aggressively. The company is also undertaking modern surveys, including HyperSpec and LiDAR, to refine its exploration strategy further.



**Operational Readiness and Infrastructure**

One of Borealis Mining's key strengths lies in its fully permitted and operational-ready infrastructure. The Borealis mine boasts a heap leach pad with 4.2 million tonnes of remaining capacity, an ADR (adsorption, desorption, and refining) facility, and an extensive mobile equipment fleet. This infrastructure allows Borealis to process ore on-site, generating doré bars that are then refined in Salt Lake City. The company’s proximity to major roads and energy sources ensures year-round accessibility and reliable power, further enhancing its operational efficiency.



**Strategic Vision and Leadership**

Borealis Mining is guided by a vision to become Nevada's newest mid-tier mining company, with ambitions to produce over 100,000 ounces of gold per year. The company's strategy revolves around not only resuming mining at Borealis but also expanding its resource base through targeted drilling and potential acquisitions.



The leadership team, featuring industry veterans like CEO Kelly Malcolm and Chair Tony Makuch, brings a wealth of experience in exploration, mine development, and corporate growth. This strong management team positions Borealis well to realize its ambitious goals.



**Future Outlook**

As Borealis Mining advances its exploration and development plans, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on its historical data and underexplored land package. With a fully equipped and operational-ready mine, a committed management team, and a strategic location in one of the top mining jurisdictions globally, Borealis Mining is set to play a significant role in Nevada's gold mining industry. Investors and stakeholders can look forward to continued progress as the company works towards achieving its production targets and unlocking the full potential of the Borealis project.



**Webinar Tomorrow**

Borealis Mining is hosting a webinar on Thursday, August 8 at 11am where CEO Kelly Malcolm will provide an in-depth update on the latest developments at the Borealis Project in Nevada. This webinar offers a unique opportunity for investors, stakeholders, and interested parties to gain insights into the company's strategic plans, ongoing exploration efforts, and the potential expansion of the Borealis mine. Attendees will have the chance to engage directly with the leadership team, ask questions, and learn more about the significant growth potential that Borealis Mining is poised to unlock in one of the world's premier gold mining regions.

2674,Stock Market Recap 08/07/2024: Buffett Holds More Treasuries Than The Federal Reserve + Snapshot of Earnings + Disney Q3,"* Markets kicked off strong this morning, hinting at a continuation of their rally, but the momentum fizzled out as the session wore on, pulling all three major indexes into the red by the close. The ongoing volatility left investors feeling dizzy once again.
* Treasury yields saw a jump as bondholders rushed to sell (a quick reminder: when bond prices drop, yields climb).
* Oil prices surged sharply, driven by concerns that rising tensions between Israel and Iran could disrupt supply. 



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Upstart Holdings** ($UPST) skyrocketed by 39.51%, fueled by stronger-than-expected earnings.

# Buffett's Treasury Holdings Surpass the Federal Reserve

# Buffett’s New Side Gig: Competing with the Fed

Warren Buffett’s latest power move? Outdoing the Federal Reserve at its own game. Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK) has now amassed more short-term U.S. Treasurys than the Fed itself, holding a whopping $234.6 billion in T-bills by the end of June. That’s an 81% leap from the $130 billion they had stashed away at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the Fed is lagging behind with a mere $195.3 billion in these government-backed IOUs.

So, why is Buffett—normally the stock market's biggest cheerleader—piling into Treasurys? The short answer: guaranteed returns. With yields hovering over 5%, Berkshire is set to pocket a cool $12 billion in annual interest, all while dodging state and local taxes. It's the ultimate “risk-free” investment for a guy who’s seen it all.

# The Oracle Goes All-In on Safety

But this isn’t just about earning some easy cash. Buffett’s massive T-bill stash suggests he’s not seeing many juicy opportunities in the stock market right now. In fact, Berkshire has been offloading stocks for seven straight quarters, including a big slice of its Apple ($AAPL) holdings. This has some Buffett-watchers wondering: Is the Oracle of Omaha turning bearish on the U.S. economy?

Or maybe, just maybe, Buffett’s biding his time for something big. The man has a history of pouncing on market dips with massive acquisitions, and with a cash reserve like this, he’s ready to strike when the iron's hot.

# Sitting on a Pile of Cash

Whether he’s waiting for the next big buying opportunity or simply playing it safe, one thing’s clear: Buffett’s in no rush. With T-bills offering over 5% returns, he’s making money while he waits. And given the current economic jitters and stock market rollercoaster, who can blame him?

So, while the Fed might be scaling back its holdings, Buffett’s cash fortress is growing. And as usual, when Buffett makes a move, the rest of us can’t help but wonder what’s coming next.



# Market Movements

* Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) stock dropped as the company wrote down $9.1 billion and missed earnings estimates.
* Rivian ($RIVN) reported mixed Q2 results but maintained its outlook, still expecting a modest gross profit by year-end.
* Uber ($UBER) announced its advertising business hit $1 billion in revenue. Uber Ads, which launched in 2022, sells ad spots across the Uber and Uber Eats apps, emails, in-car tablets, and cartops.
* Disney ($DIS) turned a profit in its streaming business for the first time.
* Nvidia ($NVDA) has been scraping large amounts of copyrighted YouTube videos to train its AI models, according to leaked documents.
* Elon Musk declared ""war"" on advertisers and sued an ad industry group and its members, which include CVS Health ($CVS) and Unilever ($UL).
* Google ($GOOGL) launched its new $100 set-top box TV streamer and announced it is discontinuing the smaller, cheaper Chromecast. It also released an updated version of its Nest Learning Thermostat for the first time in nine years.
* Microsoft ($MSFT) joined CrowdStrike ($CRWD) in firing back at Delta ($DAL), saying the airline turned down its offers to help with the fallout from last month’s massive IT outage.
* The U.S. Consumer Watchdog is probing major U.S. banks over Zelle scam concerns.



# Earnings Highlights

# Reddit Rides the AI Wave

Reddit is cashing in big time. In just its second earnings report since going public in March, the social media forum crushed Wall Street’s expectations. Q2 revenue soared 54% year-over-year, hitting $281 million and easily outpacing the predicted $254 million. The star of the show? Reddit’s AI data licensing business, which catapulted its “other revenue” segment up a staggering 691% to $28.1 million. Not bad for a company that’s still getting its sea legs as a public entity.

# Robinhood Rides the Meme-Stock Wave

Robinhood is riding high on the latest meme-stock mania. The trading platform smashed Wall Street’s expectations in its Q2 earnings report, with revenue hitting $682 million—well above the anticipated $643 million. The big driver? A surge in meme-stock and digital currency trading, which pushed transaction-based revenue up by 69% to $327 million. Not bad for a company that’s been navigating choppy waters since its IPO.

# Novo Nordisk’s Weighty Problem 

Novo Nordisk had a rough day. The Danish pharma powerhouse saw its stock tumble 8.27% after missing the mark on earnings from its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company posted a Q2 net profit of $1.86 billion—a 3% year-over-year increase—both drug sales came in below analyst expectations. Wegovy raked in $1.7 billion, falling short of the $2 billion forecast, and Ozempic sales also missed by $0.2 billion. Investors weren’t thrilled with the slimmer-than-expected numbers.



# Disney’s Streaming Magic Soars, but the Parks Hit a Speed Bump

# By the Numbers: Disney's Q3

* **$23.16 billion**: Total revenue, beating the $23.07 billion estimate.
* **$1.39**: Earnings per share, topping the expected $1.19.
* **$47 million**: Profit from combined streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+).
* **6%**: Decline in U.S. parks’ operating income.
* **4%**: Overall revenue growth year-over-year.

# Streaming Triumph

Disney ($DIS) just scored a major win, beating Wall Street’s expectations for its third-quarter earnings. The highlight? Disney’s combined streaming services—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—finally turned a profit, hitting this milestone a quarter earlier than predicted. With a $47 million operating profit compared to a $512 million loss last year, the entertainment giant’s pivot towards streaming is paying off big time.

CEO Bob Iger was quick to celebrate this success, especially since Disney's entertainment division has been weighed down by streaming losses for years. The turnaround is also thanks to hits like Pixar’s *Inside Out 2*, which helped Disney’s film studio break a losing streak.

# Parks Cool Down

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Disney’s theme parks, long the company’s profit engines, are facing some headwinds. Inflation and flat attendance at U.S. parks put a damper on earnings, leading to a 6% dip in operating income for domestic parks. The company isn’t expecting a quick rebound, forecasting a mid-single-digit profit drop in the upcoming quarter.

Despite the parks’ slowdown, Disney’s overall revenue still grew by 4% to $23.2 billion, topping the $23.1 billion analysts expected. And while the parks might be struggling, Disney is banking on its entertainment and streaming divisions to carry the load moving forward.

# Looking Ahead

To keep the streaming momentum going, Disney is hiking subscription prices, with increases up to 25% for its online video services. As for the parks, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, despite the current slump. Disney is also navigating a potential $5 billion bill to acquire Comcast’s stake in Hulu, with a final decision expected in 2025.

Overall, it’s a mixed bag for Disney: streaming is shining bright, while the parks could use a little magic.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Every Thursday, the US Department of Labor drops its initial jobless claims report, a snapshot of how many folks filed for unemployment benefits the week before. Normally, it’s a routine release that doesn’t cause much of a stir. But in today’s jittery market, it’s taken on new significance. Last Friday, a disappointing jobs report triggered a stock market sell-off, with investors fearing the labor market is cooling off quicker than the Fed anticipated. Tomorrow’s report could either fan those flames or bring some much-needed relief to nervous traders.

**Thursday:** Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

# Before Market Open:

* **Eli Lilly ($LLY)**: Riding high on the success of Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly is the toast of the obesity drug market right now. The stock’s sky-high valuations reflect investor confidence, but they’ll need to see the company deliver the goods with a solid profit boost to justify the optimism. Wall Street is mostly bullish—15 out of 18 analysts say buy—but it’s all eyes on earnings. Consensus: $2.70 EPS, $9.95 billion in revenue.
* **Yeti ($YETI)**: Remember when Yeti coolers were the must-have post-pandemic accessory? Those days may be fading, but the brand isn’t backing down. After a tough year of slipping shares, Yeti is shifting its focus to international markets. Investors are looking for proof that this strategy will pay off, especially with stronger margins translating to better profits. Consensus: $0.63 EPS, $452.29 million in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Sweetgreen ($SG)**: Sweetgreen is surfing multiple waves right now—value-conscious consumers tired of fast food and a broader shift towards healthier eating. The stock has surged over 144% in 2024, with analysts predicting even more upside. But that optimism hinges on Sweetgreen’s ability to keep delivering strong results, especially with the company’s push into automated restaurants. Consensus: -$0.10 EPS, $180.91 million in revenue.
* **e.l.f. Beauty ($ELF)**: Since its 2016 IPO, e.l.f. Beauty has built a loyal following with its affordable, high-quality cosmetics and savvy social media game. But with inflation pressuring consumer wallets, the big question is whether e.l.f. can sustain its growth. Investors are watching closely to see if the company can continue to thrive in a tougher economic climate. Consensus: $0.85 EPS, $301.44 million in revenue.",1723079103,830527,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,935a378026a932646aca78c112e02d27fb944176c237ac1f6b7df6e3c0c0dcc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1emsv4t/stock_market_recap_08072024_buffett_holds_more/

Although the market has been an absolute bloodbath lately, I'm in the market for some biotech stocks, so let's take a look at some names that have been hot in the health-techy sector.

  
**OS Therapies ($OSTX: NASDAQ) - $3.35**

OS Therapies is a clinical-stage cancer treating biotech company that focuses on developing treatments for osteosarcoma; a rare and aggressive bone cancer that predominantly affects children and teenagers.

*Key Highlights:*

—> The company’s lead treatment candidate, OST-HER2, is a generationally innovative immunotherapy designed to target proteins that have tendencies to be overexpressed in many of these cancer cases.

—> OS Therapies has made strategic acquisitions to collaborate with leading cancer and research centers, giving the company a boost in their clinical development capabilities.

—> Osteosarcoma has very limited treatment options putting $OSTX in a strategic market position.

  
**Mira Pharmaceuticals ($MIRA: NASDAQ) - $2.13**

Mira Pharmaceuticals is another biotechnology company more focused on synthetic cannabinoids addressing anxiety, chronic pain, and neurodegenerative diseases.

*Key Highlights:*

—> **MIRA1a**, $MIRA's flagship product, provides the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids without the psychoactive effects of traditional THC, and is advancing through clinical trials with optimism.

—> The global cannabinoid market is expected to grow pending legalization nationwide, as well as an increase in the production of cannabis-based medicines.

—> Strong and vastly growing network of strategic partnerships with research institutions poises the company for growth.

  
**Tenax Therapeutics ($TENX: NASDAQ) - $4.07**

Tenax Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for serious cardiopulmonary conditions.

*Key Highlights:*

—> **Levosimendan (TNX-102)**, Tenax’s lead treatment candidate, is designed to cater to pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The therapy has shown promise in clinical trials and is advancing towards Phase III.

—> Key drug in development, **TNX-201**, targets pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a condition with limited treatment options. Early data is encouraging.

—> The global market for cardiopulmonary treatments represents a significant opportunity, particularly with FDA Orphan Drug Designation for levosimendan, which could expedite approval and market entry.

Let's see how these guys play out over the next few days. Anyone else done research on these stocks? Curious as always but I’m always **hodling…**

They’re developing a drug to target multiple respiratory infections, and their next clinical trial phase is coming up soon. Haven’t seen any recent discussions here.

Here is their [latest Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nnvc-nanoviricides-broad-spectrum-technology-100900860.html).",1723146516,830542,SeparateCare143,t2_10snc0cbbj,04dde32818b7f5e1bc589395d0614900860d302c859e7baeb8f6b0f6d715a824,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1enffz2/considering_nnvc/
2687,"Bulls Relentlessly Fight Back… 8-8-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Thanks greatly to the help of the lower than expected jobless claims the bulls for a third day in a row were able to fight their way up to the daily 8 and 100ema resistance. Honestly, the impressive fight they continue to have to prevent a bigger drop is quite convincing. The question still is though can they break this downtrend once and for all or not?

From a weekly standpoint as we head into tomorrow the bulls really have a pretty strong opportunity to put in a bottom here… however, as we know anything can change in a second in this market.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/3d1cncrcyhhd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d423001bd2839336854de973d693b0001959e7a

After days of waiting for our new demand on SPY we officially put one in at 518.6. The fight for the daily 8/100ema resistance has proved to be quite the battle. We have officially broken our extreme bear channel in red. However, as you can see we have both the white and yellow downtrends to officially break still. While we did get through the 100ema finally and closed over it we did not managed to close over the daily 8ema resistance still.

I do think its notable to see that this is a bear flag on the daily still. We could be seeing a move like 7/25 to 8/1 where we had the failed breakdown that led to an upside pop that then led to the bigger breakdown. I generally was bearish for today after back to back massive rejections off the EMA resistance but the bulls in the end did win.

The question is are we seeing the worlds greatest bull trap before markets slam this back down to 504.16 and 518.6 or are we seeing the V bottom start and bulls breakout to the 550.95-554.7 resistance area into CPI next week?

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 550.95 -> 554.7  
Demand- 504.16 -> 518.6 -> 533.59 -> 538.39

Much like SPY here we finally got our new demand at 5203. That as you can see has really been our strong support for the last few days now. That level will be important in the event that this is a failed breakout by bulls again.

Now again here we did break through the more steep and extreme bear channel in red but our white downtrend since middle of July remains intact still. That level will sit at 5375 for tomorrow. We continue to fight here at this 8 and 100ema resistance near 5350. The question again remains is this a bull trap setting us up for a drop back to 5203 or is this the v bottom breakout to 5436-5459 area?

The bear flag remains pretty present here on the daily despite the fact that we turned around and immediately put in a new demand/ support at 434.8 today which is just over that critical daily 200ema support area. From here we again continue to fight directly at the daily 8ema support and the bulls just did not have the strength (despite weaker sellers) to push us higher. Much like a week ago one would expect with a 3% gain on tech to see some buyers return but that just is not the case… this move was much like FOMC day driven by VIX crush not buyers returning to the market…

From here bulls will target the 100ema resistance near 457.64 demand and bulls will target a retest of 434.8 demand near the 100ema.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 439.46 -> 471.06

NQ also broke through its extreme red bear channel here but remains within the resistance of its white and yellow bear channels. With this new demand at 17855 today we continue to support the daily 200ema but again can not manage to break through the daily 8ema resistance. We remain in extreme bear momentum and again lack a return of buyers to justify too much more upside…

Bulls will seek out a breakout to the 100ema resistance near 18862 and bulls will see our a rejection off the 8ema back down to 17855 demand put in today.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVLES  
Supply- 18165 -> 19585

Realistically this market is being driven by the VIX right now… its pretty easy to see intraday the way price moves… while buyers and sellers certainly hold their place… I am seeing the biggest correlation between price action on ES/ NQ and VIX movement since 2022.

We once again attempted to breakout and hold over 26.17 supply and failed to. But we once again are attempting to make a run back at the daily 20ema support of 20.52.

Bulls realistically need to seal a breakout by breaking down and closing/ holding under 20.52 demand and support. Bears need to find support once again in this 21.29-22.67 triple supply area.

This market has been very forgiving lately and I have found myself unable to break its hold somedays. However, today I was able to conquer this market. This is one of my better overall days and overall my best green day in all three accounts in a while. I was able to get some good reads today and some nice wins.

2688,"Luca Mining Corp. (LUCA.v, LUCMF) Advances Exploration and Gold Eq Production Expansion at Campo Morado and Tahuehueto Mines in Mexico's Sierra Madre Mineral Belt","Luca Mining Corp. (Ticker: LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors), a mid-tier producer with operations in Mexico's Sierra Madre Mineral Belt, has made significant strides in its ongoing growth and development efforts across its two primary assets, the Campo Morado and Tahuehueto mines.

https://preview.redd.it/gqtrxrrxuihd1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a1eded79ca1c0bf93461c8992f96ce26a938e96



At the end of July, LUCA announced the initiation of an extensive exploration drilling campaign across both of its projects. The company plans to drill a total of 10,000 meters, with 5,000 meters allocated to each project during the third and fourth quarters of 2024. This initiative aims to explore high-potential targets on trend with the existing mining areas, potentially unlocking further value from these operations.



Campo Morado, located in Guerrero State, is a large VMS polymetallic system rich in copper, zinc, gold, and silver. The mine, which has a milling capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day, is already generating positive cash flow. The new exploration campaign marks the first significant exploration at Campo Morado since 2013, with the company set to test over 30 untested targets, focusing initially on the top four within the fully permitted mining zone. This effort aims to explore the project's copper and gold potential, leveraging a comprehensive inventory of historical drilling data and advanced geophysical and geochemical analyses.



Tahuehueto, a newly operational gold-silver mine in Durango State, is expected to achieve commercial production in the second half of 2024. With a designed processing capacity of 1,000 tonnes per day, the mine's exploration potential remains largely untapped, with less than 10% of the concession area explored to date. The upcoming drilling will focus on step-out drilling along strike and at depth, with the goal of identifying and characterizing mineralized zones within the epithermal vein systems.



Luca Mining's strategic exploration initiatives are poised to significantly enhance its resource base, metal production profile, and overall growth potential. Dan Barnholden, CEO of Luca Mining, emphasized the transformative potential of the exploration efforts, aiming to elevate the company to a new level of production, targeting no less than 200,000 oz of gold equivalent production (annually).



Supporting this increased production target, this week LUCA announced that it had engaged Cominvi, S.A. de C.V., one of Latin America's most reputable mining contractors, to handle core mining operations at the Campo Morado mine. 



Cominvi's expertise in underground mining and its ability to quickly mobilize, following the completion of a nearby project, will enable Luca Mining to increase mill throughput from the current 1,400-1,600 tonnes per day to 2,000 tonnes per day by the end of 2024, with further plans to reach a 2,400 tonnes per day mill rate during 2025.



Barnholden expressed confidence that Cominvi's involvement would enhance operational flexibility and facilitate the execution of Luca Mining's broader strategic goals, including the ongoing Campo Morado Improvement Project, which aims to increase metallurgical recoveries and produce higher-value concentrates. This collaboration is expected to significantly impact the company's production, costs, and cash flow positively.



Luca Mining's focused approach to exploration and operational excellence underscores its commitment to maximizing shareholder value while positioning itself as a leading player in the mining sector.

* **Zillow** ($ZG) soared 18.27%, outpacing the Austin housing market, on strong earnings and a clearer CEO succession plan.

* **Bumble** ($BMBL) tumbled 29.16% after management forecasted third-quarter revenue well below Wall Street’s expectations.
* **JFrog** ($FROG) plummeted 27.52%, as a revenue miss and dismal guidance for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year overshadowed a profit beat.

# Weight-Loss Wars: Novo Nordisk vs. Eli Lilly

# Novo’s Pricey Problem

Novo Nordisk ($NVO), the Danish pharma titan behind the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy (prescribed for weight loss) and Ozempic (prescribed for type 2 diabetes), just had a rare misstep. Despite soaring demand, Wegovy’s sales in the latest quarter came in at a disappointing $1.7 billion—falling short of the $2 billion that analysts had penciled in. The culprit? Higher-than-expected price concessions to US pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who hold the keys to market access. This squeeze has left investors uneasy, especially as rival Eli Lilly ($LLY) muscles in with its competing drug, Zepbound.

Novo’s CFO, Karsten Knudsen, tried to calm the waters, saying the rebates were a one-time issue. But the shortfall was enough to knock Novo’s stock down by as much as 7.7% in Copenhagen, before it clawed back some of those losses. And it wasn’t just Wegovy that took a hit—Novo’s diabetes blockbuster, Ozempic, also missed expectations.

# Lilly’s Winning Streak

Meanwhile, over at Eli Lilly, the mood couldn’t be more different. The Indianapolis-based pharma giant reported a knockout quarter, with Zepbound raking in over $1 billion for the first time since its late 2023 launch. Alongside Mounjaro, Lilly’s other GLP-1 drug, the two brought in a combined $4.3 billion in revenue, smashing analyst forecasts and sending Lilly’s stock soaring by up to 14%.

Lilly’s secret sauce? A combination of beefed-up manufacturing and smart supply chain moves. The company has been investing billions in new production facilities, ensuring that its drugs are widely available—something that’s still tripping up Novo. Lilly’s Chief Scientific Officer, Daniel Skovronsky, noted that they’re not even pushing Zepbound hard, yet the demand is “unbelievable.”

# The Road Ahead

Despite the hiccups, Novo’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen remains optimistic, saying it’s still “early days” in capturing the massive US market. Novo is working to ramp up production and expand its coverage, but it’s clear that pricing pressures and supply chain challenges aren’t going away anytime soon. The company had to slightly dial back its full-year operating profit forecast to a 20%-28% increase, down from its earlier 22%-28% prediction.

On the flip side, Lilly’s got momentum on its side, having managed to get Zepbound off the FDA’s drug shortage list while Novo is still struggling with limited availability of one Wegovy dose in the US. Analysts predict that the US market will likely be split 50-50 between these two giants by year-end.

So, what’s the play here? Both Novo and Lilly remain strong contenders in the obesity drug arena, with analysts still giving them a buy rating. It’s clear that both companies are in it for the long haul, investing heavily in production capacity and new drug developments. For investors, there’s room for both to share the stage in your portfolio.



# Market Movements

* Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) posted a whopping $9.1 billion loss in Q2, largely due to the declining value of its linear TV networks. That’s a blockbuster bomb for the books, and investors weren't thrilled.
* Lyft’s ($LYFT) CEO is on a mission to KO surge pricing, unveiling a new feature that lets riders subscribe to lock in ride prices for specific routes at specific times. Whether this will drive their stock up remains to be seen, but it’s a bold move.
* Reddit is going full AI with new search features after teaming up with OpenAI and Google. The platform ended Q2 with shares up 60% since its March IPO and a 51% bump in daily users. Not bad for a social media veteran.
* Palantir ($PLTR) shares are on the rise, boosted by an AI partnership with Microsoft. It’s clear investors are buying into the AI hype.
* FTX got slapped with an order to pay $12.7 billion to customers, according to the U.S. CFTC. Let’s just say the digital currency market isn’t exactly rallying behind this news.
* JPMorgan ($JPM) has upped its 2024 recession odds to 35%. Sounds like they’re hedging their bets for a bumpy ride ahead.
* Paramount ($PARA) just posted its first-ever quarter of streaming profits but is planning a 15% layoff to keep things lean. Tough times call for tough decisions.
* Apple’s ($AAPL) rumored to be launching its smallest computer ever, a Mac mini with the new M4 chip. Tiny but mighty is the name of the game.
* Today’s jobs report brought some good news: unemployment insurance applications dropped to 233,000, beating expectations.
* Good news for those house hunting—mortgage rates fell to 6.47% this week, their lowest level in over a year. Time to lock in that dream home.



# Earnings Roundup

# Warner Bros. Discovery’s Stock Takes a Dive

Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) just hit another rough patch, watching its stock nosedive 9% after missing both earnings and revenue expectations. The entertainment giant is grappling with the fast-evolving TV landscape and took a massive $9.1 billion write-down on network assets—an ominous sign for the company’s future. Adding salt to the wound, their decades-long partnership with the NBA unraveled, leaving the company in a legal quagmire that’s only deepening its troubles.

# Under Armour Surprises, Despite Slumping Sales

Under Armour ($UA) defied expectations, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom lines despite declining sales. The athletic apparel brand saw its shares leap 17.75% after reporting $1.18 billion in revenue, edging past the $1.15 billion analysts predicted. The company is in the midst of a major overhaul, slashing discounts and trimming its workforce. While sales dipped 10% year over year, investors seem bullish on Under Armour’s comeback story.

# CVS Health Feels the Medicare Pinch

CVS Health ($CVS) is feeling under the weather, thanks to a rough quarter for its Medicare business. The pharmacy giant had to lower its full-year earnings outlook yet again after reporting a 17% drop in earnings per share from last year. Even with a revenue bump to $91.2 billion, high medical costs and challenges in attracting seniors to its Aetna Medicare Advantage plan weighed heavily on profits. Recent changes in how private insurers are paid didn’t help matters either, making it a tough quarter for CVS.

  


# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

There aren't any major economic announcements on the horizon for tomorrow, and after a whirlwind of earnings reports, things are finally winding down as we head into the weekend. With no big-name, large-cap companies set to report, let's shift our focus to some of the more obscure and quirky stocks releasing their earnings.

# Before Market Open:

* **Canopy Growth ($CGC)**: Like many cannabis companies, Canopy Growth’s fate hinges on the promise of legalization. Earlier this year, the stock surged when it looked like marijuana might be reclassified under a different drug schedule. But when reality set in that this change wasn’t imminent, the stock lost steam. While it might be an intriguing long-term play, keep in mind that until marijuana is legalized nationwide, your investment could go up in smoke. Expected earnings: -$0.35 per share, with $53.84 million in revenue.
* **Soho House ($SHCO)**: This exclusive, members-only club is all about catering to those willing to pay for a chic hangout spot. However, as a publicly traded company, it hasn’t exactly thrived. The company’s debt-laden balance sheet has investors so disillusioned that management is mulling over taking it private again. The brand may have clout, but the investment appeal is as diluted as their Picante de la Casa cocktail. Expected earnings: -$0.11 per share, with $302.97 million in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Getty Images ($GETY)**: Ever wondered how a company that sells stock photos stays profitable these days? Well, it turns out it doesn’t. The rise of generative AI images has sent Getty’s stock plummeting, and it’s been a rough ride since the company went public through a SPAC in July 2022. The stock's performance chart is downright depressing.

2694,GLIOF: My Uranium Play of the Week,"**Good morning, everyone!** After an eventful summer, I’m ready to settle in and focus on some promising penny stocks. Over the next week, GLIOF is going to be on my radar. While I’ll dive deeper into the technicals next week, I wanted to share some initial DD with you now. **Communicated disclaimer, nfa.**

I’ll be back next week with more detailed TA and insights!

# Overview & Why GLIOF Caught My Eye

Panther Minerals (OTC: GLIOF) has been making some impressive strides lately, especially with the recent acquisition of the Huber Heights Uranium Property in Nevada. This, alongside other acquisitions in Alaska, positions Panther Minerals as a significant player in some of North America’s most promising uranium-rich regions (which I’m **extremely bullish** on). Their strategy is all about acquiring and developing high-potential properties, utilizing cutting-edge exploration technologies, and tapping into the growing uranium demand, both domestically and internationally.

# Targets

Here are a few price targets I’ve got my eye on:

* **Current price:** $0.24 (via TradingView)
* **Targets:**
   1. $0.29
   2. $0.33
   3. $0.39
   4. $0.50

# Interesting Tidbits

Panther Minerals isn’t your average mining company. They’re pioneering the use of advanced exploration technologies like hyperspectral satellite imagery and long-wave infrared surveys. This tech not only cuts down on exploration costs but also speeds up the process from discovery to development.

Their work in the Boulder Creek and Fireweed prospects in Alaska is particularly exciting. These sites are rich in historical data and are showing significant potential for high-grade uranium deposits. The expansion of their land package in this area by about 75 times showcases Panther’s commitment to large-scale exploration efforts (**gotta love it**).

# Why Consider GLIOF?

1. **Strategic Property Acquisitions:** The acquisition of key properties in Nevada and Alaska bolsters Panther’s portfolio in critical uranium regions.
2. **Advanced Exploration Techniques:** By employing state-of-the-art technology, Panther boosts exploration efficiency and accuracy, giving them a competitive edge.
3. **Favorable Market Dynamics:** The global shift towards clean energy, along with U.S. government support for domestic uranium production, creates a promising environment for growth.
4. **Experienced Leadership:** With seasoned industry veterans at the helm, Panther is well-prepared to navigate the complexities of the mining sector.
5. **Promising Exploration Sites:** High-grade potential at sites like Boulder Creek and Fireweed means Panther is set to significantly increase its asset value.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, uranium is my top pick for metals, and uranium companies make up a significant portion of my Roth IRA. GLIOF is in an ideal position to benefit from the growth in the uranium sector. I’d love to hear your thoughts! **P.S. - GLIOF is up 3650% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance, ha!**

Good luck and much love <3

2706,"$LVO was up 75% for the year but is now only at 22%: Is it on anyone else's radar, too?","Hello, pennystocks sub! I was curious if people had been keeping up with LVO and its price action like I have. Although it has been pretty stagnant this past week, the last two months, as well as all of 2024, have had some significant upsides.

Back in July it touched the 2024 low very briefly but is up around 23% since then. Now in August, sitting at a price of $1.49, it has been fluctuating above and below the 200 SMA showing a lot of indecision. At its current price, it has got me wondering if it can get back above $2.00 where it was back in March. First things first, it needs to solidify above the 200 before we can

2709,BIG opportunity on $KULR,"Since unveiling the KULR ONE platform at CES in January 2024, KULR Technology has made significant strides that are likely to drive substantial growth in their upcoming Q2 earnings report. The company secured a $1.13 million contract with the U.S. Army in April 2024, followed by an $865,000 deal with Nanoracks in March 2024, and a $400,000 contract with NASA in June 2024. Additionally, the Forge Nano agreement, signed in September 2023, guarantees $3.5 million over 12 months. These high-value contracts, along with ongoing revenue from recurring contracts estimated between $1.5 million and $2 million per quarter, position KULR to exceed its Q2 revenue estimate of $2.23 million.

CEO Michael Mo's strategic cost management and salary reductions are expected to further enhance profitability. KULR’s impressive client roster includes General Motors, SpaceX, NASA, the U.S. Army, UPS, Meta, Bombardier, Lockheed Martin, NanoRacks, Forge Nano, and even Japanese automakers, with Tesla potentially joining the list soon. Moreover, KULR has secured Department of Transportation (DOT) approval for ground transportation and holds an exclusive license from NASA for its internal short circuit (ISC) technology. With such strong fundamentals and strategic advancements, KULR is poised for a significant earnings boost, making it a compelling buy before Monday’s after-hours report.",1723234833,830596,This_Specific7789,t2_9sgeo0pj,144dc11f54e15414f816ab63a85e9214ca580c28925c16aa00bed1acc5965b8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eo9w0y/big_opportunity_on_kulr/
2710,EMP Metals Corp. (EMPS.c) Solidifies Position in Canadian Lithium Market with 100% Acquisition of Hub City Lithium and Launch of New Drilling Program. + Info on EMPS' Direct Lithium Extraction Pilot Plant in Partnership with Koch Technology Solutions,"EMP Metals Corp. (CSE: EMPS) (OTCQB: EMPPF) is a Canadian-based lithium exploration and development company focused on leveraging large-scale lithium resources through direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology and currently holds substantial acreage in Southern Saskatchewan.



Notably, EMPS is partnered with Koch, one of the largest privately held conglomerates in the United States according to Forbes⬇️

https://www.forbes.com/lists/largest-private-companies/



In April, EMPS announced the commencement and commissioning of its Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) Field Pilot Facility in Estevan, Saskatchewan, marking the first Koch Technology Solutions (KTS) DLE pilot skid to be operated in Canada. 



This facility will simulate field operating conditions, processing high lithium concentration brine from the Viewfield area, which has shown lithium concentrations up to 259 mg/L. The pilot plant aims to gather critical performance data to support detailed engineering for a stage 1 commercial facility in Southern Saskatchewan.

In another pivotal move, EMPS shared yesterday that it has acquired ROK Resources Inc.'s interest in Hub City Lithium. As a result, EMPS will own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Hub City Lithium, which holds lithium properties in Saskatchewan. The transaction represents a significant consolidation of EMPS’ interests in the Saskatchewan lithium assets. 



EMPS’ CEO, Rob Gaml ey, emphasized the strategic importance of this acquisition in advancing the company's flagship Viewfield project, which is noted for having the highest recorded lithium grades in Canada and among the cleanest brines in North America.

2711,Stock Market Recap 08/09/2024: Anduril’s $14B Game Plan +  Costco Cracks Down Membership With Scanners + Next Week,"# Markets

* The market rollercoaster has come full circle: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have erased their losses from earlier in the week as recession worries took a backseat and investors seized the opportunity to buy the dip. Meanwhile, the Dow clawed its way into the green by the closing bell, though it's still shy of a full recovery, remaining comfortably above this week’s low points.
* Treasury yields dipped slightly as investors sought refuge in bonds, nudging yields just below the crucial 4% threshold.
* While most of the market was on a bumpy ride, oil had a stellar week, fueled by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threatened to choke supply and push prices upward.



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Doximity** ($DOCS) skyrocketed 38.74% after the medical platform exceeded earnings expectations and raised its guidance, benefiting from its investment in the DoximityGPT AI model.
* **Sweetgreen** ($SG) surged 33.37% following a robust earnings report and an optimistic sales outlook for 2024. 
* **Expedia** ($EXPE) advanced 10.21% on an earnings beat, successfully navigating through a potential consumer spending dip. 
* **Unity Software** ($U) climbed 8.22% despite lower year-over-year revenue, still surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.
* **Nikola** ($NKLA) increased 8.21% after posting a surprisingly strong quarter with sales up by 318%. 
* **Take-Two Interactive** ($TTWO) rose 4.35% on better-than-expected earnings, though questions remain about the impact of its Gearbox acquisition and the release date of GTA 6.

* **New Fortress Energy** ($NFE) plunged 23.62% after missing both earnings and revenue targets last quarter. 
* **Array Technologies** ($ARRY) dropped 21.02% despite beating analyst estimates, as the company lowered its fiscal year guidance. 
* **Insulet** ($PODD) declined 8.81% even after an earnings beat, with concerns over the cost of unused insulin devices weighing on the stock.
* **Capri Holdings** ($CPRI) fell 4.86% as slowing sales from financially strained consumers put pressure on the company founded by Michael Kors. 
* **e.l.f. Beauty** ($ELF) slipped 14.43% despite surpassing earnings estimates and offering an upbeat fiscal year outlook, as investors worry about stiff competition.



# Anduril’s $14B Game Plan: Autonomous Weapons Factories

The defense tech startup Anduril Industries, famous for being named after a fictional sword used by The Lord of the Rings character Aragorn, and founded by Oculus teen prodigy Palmer Luckey, just secured a cool $1.5 billion in new funding. This brings its valuation to a jaw-dropping $14 billion, just seven years after it launched. And what’s on their shopping list with all that cash? Autonomous weapons factories, because why build a regular factory when you can build one that churns out high-tech war machines like it’s no big deal?

# Cracking the Government Code

Anduril has quickly climbed the ranks to become a serious contender in the defense world, a sector where newcomers rarely survive, let alone thrive. The company has somehow cracked the government contract code by consistently delivering on time, on budget, and with tech that’s making the old guard sweat. They recently outmaneuvered giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing to snag a contract with the U.S. Air Force for developing uncrewed fighter jet prototypes. So yeah, Anduril is playing with the big boys now.

# Meet Arsenal-1: The Mega Weapons Factory

Now, let’s talk about Arsenal-1, Anduril’s planned 5-million-square-foot megafactory. This isn’t your average assembly line. Think of it as the Willy Wonka factory of autonomous military systems. The plan? Produce tens of thousands of these systems annually, with a workforce that could number in the thousands. Anduril’s Chief Strategy Officer, Chris Brose, says Arsenal-1 is just the start—they’re already eyeing additional locations, including one abroad. The goal is to scale defense production in a way the industry hasn’t seen in decades, potentially saving the day when global conflicts demand rapid resupply.

# Why It Matters

The timing couldn’t be more critical. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has highlighted a glaring issue: the U.S. and its allies don’t have enough military equipment stockpiled for a prolonged conflict. Anduril’s ambitious plans to ramp up production are designed to address this shortfall. As Brose put it bluntly, ""America and our allies don’t have enough stuff."" With a global stage set for potential conflicts, investors are betting big on Anduril’s ability to deliver.

# What’s Next?

Expect Anduril to keep scaling, with the $1.5 billion war chest enabling them to expand their manufacturing capabilities and continue developing cutting-edge defense tech. The investors behind this latest funding round—including Sands Capital and Founders Fund—are clearly convinced that Anduril is the next big thing in defense. They’re not just throwing cash at a flashy startup; they’re betting on Anduril to reshape the future of military production. And with Arsenal-1 on the horizon, Anduril seems ready to do just that.



# Market Movements

* Google ($GOOGL) and Meta ($META) have joined forces to target teens with Instagram ads on YouTube, reportedly bending Google’s own rules, according to the Financial Times.
* UK regulators are launching a formal investigation into Amazon’s ($AMZN) $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic, as governments ramp up scrutiny of Big Tech’s moves in the sector.
* Duolingo ($DUOL) is on a winning streak, reporting a net income of $24.4 million—a staggering 500%+ YoY increase—marking its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. The platform now boasts over 100 million daily active users and 8 million paid users.
* TKO Group Holdings ($TKO), the parent company of WWE and UFC, is thriving, with record quarterly revenue of $851 million, driven by UFC’s 29% annual revenue growth.
* Cisco ($CSCO) is planning another round of layoffs, its second major job cut this year.
* Tesla’s ($TSLA) board is under scrutiny from Elizabeth Warren, who’s raising concerns about Elon Musk’s corporate ‘entanglements.’
* Humane’s AI PIN numbers aren’t looking so good. Over $1 million worth of the $9 million in pins and accessories originally sold have been returned. Between May and August, more Pins were returned than purchased.
* Stellantis ($STLA) is laying off 2,450 plant workers due to the discontinuation of the Ram “Classic” pickup truck.



# Costco Cracks Down: Membership Scanners Coming to All Stores

Heads up, Costco ($COST) fans—your days of sneaking into the warehouse without a membership card are officially numbered. Costco announced it's rolling out membership scanners at the entrances of all its locations. Over the coming months, instead of casually flashing your card at the door, you’ll need to scan it, whether it’s physical or digital. And don’t even think about borrowing mom’s card for that sweet rotisserie chicken—Costco’s tightening up its security.

# Card Sharing Crackdown

So, what’s behind this crackdown? Costco’s CFO Richard Galanti mentioned that since the pandemic, more people have been trying to sneak in using someone else’s membership. Not cool, folks. Costco isn’t playing games anymore. They’ve already started testing these scanners earlier this year, and the results have them feeling confident about rolling them out nationwide.

This move isn’t just about keeping non-members out—it’s also about speeding things up inside. By scanning at the entrance, there’s no need for employees to check cards at registers or self-checkout, meaning a quicker in-and-out for everyone.

# Membership Fees: The Real Money Maker

Why is Costco so serious about memberships? Because that’s where the big bucks come from. Last year alone, Costco raked in $4.6 billion from membership fees. These fees are crucial to Costco’s profits, and with nearly 128 million members, the warehouse giant has a lot to protect. Starting September 1, those fees are going up for the first time since 2017. The basic Gold Star membership will rise from $60 to $65, while the Executive Membership jumps from $120 to $130. Plus, the maximum 2% reward for Executive members will increase to $1,250 from $1,000.

# What It Means for You

If you’re a member, make sure to bring your card—and a photo ID if your membership doesn’t include a picture—every time you visit. Guests? They’ll still need to be accompanied by a member to get in. This move is Costco’s latest effort to ensure that only paying members enjoy the perks, like that famous $1.50 hot dog combo.

So next time you’re headed to Costco, don’t forget your card. With these new scanners, Costco is serious about keeping its benefits exclusive—and its lines moving faster.

  


# On The Horizon

# Next Week

After a mellow week on the economic front, things are about to get a bit more lively. The main event? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report dropping on Wednesday. This report is like the market’s thermometer for inflation—if it shows inflation cooling off, we might see some serious market enthusiasm. But if it disappoints, brace yourself for more turbulence.

Tuesday brings the Producer Price Index (PPI), giving us a peek into the manufacturing sector's health. Then, on Thursday, we’ll see how Americans are flexing their spending muscles with July’s retail sales numbers. And to wrap it up, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey on Friday will clue us in on how folks are feeling about the economy these days.

Earnings season is winding down, with around 90% of the S&P 500 having already spilled their quarterly beans. But don’t tune out just yet—there are still some heavy hitters to watch out for.

* Investors faced a whirlwind week, starting with a steep market drop driven by recession fears and a sudden unwind of a yen carry trade. However, the market quickly bounced back as savvy investors saw buying opportunities, though volatility remained high. A surprising rally later in the week, sparked by better-than-expected jobless claims, underscored the unpredictability. Despite the ups and downs, the key takeaway is to maintain a long-term perspective, using strategies like dollar-cost averaging to navigate the market's twists and turns while finding strong investments at attractive prices.



# CPI Report to Test Markets

# CPI Showdown: Traders Brace for Big Market Swings

Wall Street’s version of a summer blockbuster is about to hit: the much-anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) report drops this Wednesday. And with it, traders are prepping for some serious market turbulence. The options market is signaling a potential 1.2% move in either direction for the S&P 500 ($SPY), reflecting the anxiety that's been building as inflation numbers approach. After last week’s rollercoaster—where the VIX spiked to levels not seen since the pandemic—the CPI could either calm nerves or send the market into another tailspin.

# Volatility Takes Center Stage

It’s been a summer to forget for investors, but the drama is far from over. Last week, the S&P 500 managed to claw back some losses after Monday’s 3% plunge, thanks to the unwinding of a massive yen carry trade that rattled global bond markets. But don’t pop the champagne just yet—options pros are still not buying the recovery. Contracts betting on a 10% drop in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days are at their priciest since October. Even Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium isn’t expected to ease the tension.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury is also back to pre-jobs report levels, wiping out most of its recent decline. This suggests that traders are far from convinced that the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes are done crimping the economy. As Sage Advisory’s Thomas Urano put it, “We’re at an inflection point where bad news is suddenly good news because it might force the Fed to pivot.” But if Wednesday’s CPI data comes in hotter than expected, we could see another round of stock market whiplash.

# Powell, Tech, and the Recession Watch

Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech and Nvidia’s ($NVDA) earnings report later this month are the other two major events traders are watching like hawks. The options market is already pricing in similar moves for both dates, but what happens Wednesday could set the tone for the rest of the month—and possibly the rest of the year.

Meanwhile, the labor market continues to be a mixed bag. The yield curve between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes briefly normalized, a signal that has preceded every recession in the past 50 years, only to invert again as recession fears receded. With unemployment ticking up to 4.3%, well above Fed forecasts, the upcoming August jobs report will be just as crucial as the CPI in determining the Fed’s next steps.

So, what’s the bottom line? The market is at a crossroads. If the CPI comes in cooler than expected, it could confirm hopes for a Fed rate cut in September, potentially giving stocks a much-needed boost. But if inflation remains stubborn, expect more volatility and a possible retest of recent lows. As Brooke May of Evans May Wealth warns, “The economy isn’t as bad as people think, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see more downside for stocks in the coming weeks.”

# This Past Week In Markets

**Monday:** Investors kicked off the week with dread thicker than your average Monday blues. The previous Friday’s dismal jobs report had everyone wondering if the Fed could avoid steering us straight into a recession. Spoiler alert: The markets tanked like they had no intention of hitting the brakes.

To make matters worse, a lesser-known carry trade involving the Japanese yen blew up at the worst possible time. Wall Street's clever trick of borrowing yen to buy dollars backfired when the Bank of Japan decided to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years—right as the Fed was thinking about cutting rates stateside. The result? Traders scrambled, portfolios got a beating, and red dominated the screens.

**Tuesday:** Cue the dramatic comeback. Markets rebounded almost as fast as they’d dropped, with investors eyeing Monday’s mess as a prime buying opportunity. The year’s gains made it clear that Monday’s slide was just a bump on the road, so staying the course was the play of the day.

**Wednesday:** The week’s rollercoaster continued with a strong start that quickly fizzled out. Stocks slid again, but Wall Street pros weren’t panicking—they were shopping. Wells Fargo gave a thumbs up to large-cap stocks, Bank of America ($BAC) said it’s time to hunt for value, UBS suggested cozying up to gold and the Swiss franc, and Goldman Sachs ($GS) reminded everyone that diversification is the name of the game.

**Thursday:** And then, boom—markets soared on a surprisingly positive employment report. Jobless claims came in better than expected, sparking hope that last week’s ugly jobs data was just a fluke. The S&P 500 ($SPX) saw its best day of trading since 2022, a whiplash from the worst day since 2022 just a few days earlier.

**Friday:** After a week of wild swings, the markets ended on a high note, clawing back most of the earlier losses. The S&P 500 gained 0.47%, the Nasdaq added 0.51%, and the Dow inched up 0.13%. Despite Monday's steep sell-off and the market's sharpest drop since 2022, Thursday's rally helped turn the tide, fueled by better-than-expected jobless claims. Oil prices also saw a significant uptick, closing out the week with more than a 4% gain, driven by easing recession fears and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

**The Bottom Line:** Volatility is the name of the game right now, and while it might be tempting to bail before the next downturn, keep your cool. Stay focused on the long term, lean on dollar-cost averaging to smooth out the ride, and look for those quality buys amid the chaos.



# On The Horizon

# This Week

After a quiet stretch, the economic action is about to heat up. The star of the show? Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which serves as the market's go-to gauge for inflation. If the numbers suggest inflation is cooling, expect some market fireworks. But if the report misses the mark, get ready for a bumpy ride.

Before that, Tuesday gives us a glimpse into the manufacturing scene with the Producer Price Index (PPI). Thursday turns the spotlight on July’s retail sales, showing us how Americans are spending their cash. And to cap off the week, Friday’s University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey will reveal how people are feeling about the economy.

Earnings season is winding down, but don’t sleep on it just yet. Some big names are still in the mix:

# Upcoming Earnings:

* **Monday:** Barrick Gold ($GOLD), Monday.com ($MNDY), Buzzfeed ($BZFD)

LiveOne ($LVO: NASDAQ) just announced that their total paid members have surged past 3.1 million, marking a respectable 46% increase year-over-year.

The company is also making moves to expand its offerings in all realms of live entertainment as well as enhance user experience.

With their focus on live music, podcasts, and original content, $LVO is positioning itself as a leader in the digital media space.

With the digital content market booming, is LiveOne setting themselves up for new highs, or is this another ploy for a rug-pull with earnings coming on Thursday?

* Wall Street played a game of tug-of-war on Monday, as stocks wavered but managed to cling to the momentum from last week’s rally. The S&P 500 ended the day virtually unchanged, inching up just 0.23 points, while the Nasdaq eked out a 0.21% gain, thanks in part to Nvidia’s 4% surge. Meanwhile, the Dow dropped 140 points, or 0.36%, as investors grew jittery ahead of crucial inflation data set to drop this week.
* With the Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday and retail sales data following on Thursday, all eyes are on the economic gauges that could either steady or spook the markets. After a week of whiplash, traders are hoping for clarity, but the volatility might not be over just yet. 



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Monday.com** ($MNDY) jumped 14.78% following a strong second-quarter earnings report, which beat estimates, driven by strength in its enterprise business.
* **KeyCorp** ($KEY) surged 9.10% after Canadian lender Bank of Nova Scotia, also known as Scotiabank, acquired a 14.9% stake in the regional U.S. lender for $2.8 billion.
* **Barrick Gold Corporation** ($GOLD) climbed 9.08% as the gold-mining company reported a robust second quarter.
* **Super Micro Computer** ($SMCI) gained 6.33%, rebounding after last week's sell-off in AI-related stocks, aided by a Wall Street Journal article highlighting the company's new direct liquid cooling products.
* **Nvidia** ($NVDA) rose 4.08% after being named a top “rebound” stock by Bank of America.

# What’s down 📉

* **JetBlue Airways** ($JBLU) plummeted 20.66% as the company announced new senior secured note offerings, including $2.7 billion in debt, prompting analysts to downgrade their ratings.

# Tesla Cybertruck Now Starts at $100K After Dropping Cheapest Model

Tesla ($TSLA) just gave the Cybertruck's price tag a serious jolt—if you were holding out for the ""affordable"" $60,990 model, you're out of luck. Tesla quietly pulled that version from its lineup, leaving the cheapest Cybertruck at a jaw-dropping $99,990. That’s a $39,000 leap from where the price floor used to be.

# The Price of Progress?

But wait, there’s more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That’s a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury—because clearly, the entry-level market isn’t a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it’s speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don’t let the expedited shipping fool you—these price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing—a red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren’t translating into actual sales. So, while Tesla might be speeding up production, it could also be facing the reality that a $100K truck isn’t exactly a hot commodity. But hey, if you’ve got $100K burning a hole in your pocket, Tesla’s got just the truck for you.

  


# Market Movements

# Trump Returns to X, $DJT Stock Takes a Hit

Donald Trump is back on X (formerly Twitter), and his reappearance is already shaking things up. Just ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Elon Musk, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) dipped 5%. The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, marks Trump’s first major return to the platform since August 2023. The question on everyone’s mind: What does this mean for Trump’s own social media platform, Truth Social?

# X Marks the Spot

Trump’s return to X is a big deal—after all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there’s a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let’s not forget, this move comes after Musk’s recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump’s return to X isn’t just about tweets—it’s affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump’s renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump’s followers stick around on his platform if he’s back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn’t be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on. 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July’s PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June’s 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there’s a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Before Market Open:

* **Home Depot** ($HD) is one to watch as it gears up to report earnings. The home improvement giant saw a major boost during the pandemic, with folks stuck at home taking on DIY projects. But with the stock flatlining this year, investors are nervous that the renovation boom may be fading. This earnings report could set the tone for Home Depot’s performance for the rest of 2024. Analysts are expecting $4.50 earnings per share (EPS) on $43.38 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Tencent Music Entertainment** ($TME), a subsidiary of Chinese tech titan Tencent Holdings, is also in the spotlight. As a powerhouse in China’s music industry, TME has been eyeing global expansion, bolstered by its 8.6% stake in Spotify and a recent partnership with Universal Music Group. Investors will be eager to hear more about the company’s growth strategy. The consensus forecast is $0.16 EPS on $996.68 million in revenue.",1723502248,830759,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,ac6752c3e4f0aa83c3dcc852eb247db12abbfcc1a265706444c03f591c20c6a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eqrkjt/stock_market_recap_08122024_tsla_halts_orders_on/

2740,"""Finding Reversals"" Watchlist - $WCUFF consolidation phase might be ending + $ADAP Curling up from its bottom","**World Copper $WCUUF** is the first  candidate for finding its bottom and turning around

**Chart Pattern and Trend**

* Descending Channel: The stock is clearly trading within a downward-sloping channel. The price action since late May 2023 has respected this channel, indicating sustained bearish momentum.
* MACD: The MACD is currently negative, with the MACD line below the signal line, indicating continued bearish sentiment.

**Potential Bottom Signals**

* Channel Support: The stock is currently near the lower boundary of the descending channel. If the stock can hold this lower boundary and potentially break above the channel resistance, it could indicate a reversal.
* 200-Day Moving Average: The stock is trading below its 200-day moving average (around $0.0918), which is typically a bearish signal. However, a reclaim of this level would be a strong bullish indicator.

Now for $ADAP

**Chart Pattern and Trend**

* Downtrend: The stock has been in a steep downtrend since early 2021, with consistent lower highs and lower lows, reaching a low around May 2023.
* Base Formation: Since mid-2023, the stock has been trading in a range between approximately $0.75 and $1.50, suggesting a base or consolidation phase. This could potentially lead to a trend reversal if the stock breaks out to the upside.
* Volume: There was a significant increase in volume around the May 2023 low, which could indicate a capitulation event or the start of accumulation by buyers at lower levels.

**Potential Bottom Signals**

* Support Level: The stock seems to be finding support around $0.75, which has been tested multiple times since mid-2023 without a breakdown.
* Resistance Level: The key resistance level to watch is around $1.50. A breakout above this level would signal the potential end of the downtrend and the beginning of a new uptrend

2743,Stock Market Recap 08/13/2024: Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO + Wednesday's CPI + Home Depot Earnings,"# Markets

* The stock market basked in green on Tuesday, with indexes climbing higher as investors welcomed cooler-than-expected inflation data. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July showed a modest 0.1% increase, offering some hope that inflation is cooling off. This comes just in time for Wednesday's much-anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Thursday's retail sales data, both of which are crucial for gauging the economy's health.
* Tech stocks led the rally, with the Nasdaq surging 2.43%, marking its best five-day streak since November. The S&P 500 wasn't far behind, adding 1.68%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up by 1.04%.



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **BuzzFeed** ($BZFD) surged 25.89% after the company narrowed its second-quarter loss and announced that its new rollouts are beginning to pay off.
* **Starbucks** ($SBUX) spiked 24.5% after announcing that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down immediately, with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol stepping in as his replacement.
* **Sea Limited** ($SE) jumped 11.85% after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations, coupled with positive guidance for its Shopee eCommerce business.
* **Carvana** ($CVNA) rose 9.75% on broader market optimism driven by a softer-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) report.
* **Rumble** ($RUM) gained 5.39% following a better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report.

# What’s down 📉

* **Tencent Music Entertainment** ($TME) plunged 15.31% after reporting earnings that fell well below Wall Street’s estimates, with revenue only narrowly beating analyst predictions.
* **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ($CMG) dropped 7.5% after announcing that CEO Brian Niccol is leaving to become the new CEO of Starbucks.
* **Illumina** ($ILMN) declined 3.87% despite delivering better-than-expected earnings and revenue in Q2 2024, as the company lowered its 2024 revenue guidance, which disappointed investors.
* **Trump Media & Technology Group** ($DJT) slid 3.62% following former President Trump's interview with Elon Musk on X.

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they’d just had a double shot of espresso—sending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he’s trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks’ sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company’s sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit. Enter Niccol, who’s expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic—think streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it’s not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol’s got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks’ not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who’s still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle’s Loss, Starbucks’ Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle’s stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol’s departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol’s got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he’s got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned—it’s going to be a wild brew.

# CPI: The Fed’s Next Move Hangs in the Balance

Tomorrow’s CPI report is the main event everyone’s been waiting for—think of it as the Super Bowl for inflation watchers. With today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in cooler than expected, all eyes are now on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to see if inflation continues to ease up. Economists are expecting a 0.2% bump in both the headline and core CPI readings, with year-over-year inflation holding steady at 3%. If those numbers hit, the Federal Reserve might finally be able to shift its focus from fighting inflation to tackling other economic challenges—like that pesky slowing labor market.

# What’s at Stake: A Green Light or a Roadblock?

Here’s why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there’s growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: “Inflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There’s this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.”

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears—a combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that’s basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

# The Fed’s Next Move: Rate Cuts or More Tightening?

So, what’s at stake? A lot. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, but tomorrow’s CPI report could either seal the deal or flip the script. If inflation stays on the down-low, the Fed might finally be able to take its foot off the gas. But if prices start heating up again, well, we might be in for a bumpy ride.



# Home Depot’s Reality Check: Deferral Mode Activated

# 🛠️ By the Numbers:

* **Comparable Sales:** Down 3.3% (7th consecutive quarterly decline)
* **Revenue:** $43.18 billion (vs. $43.06 billion expected)
* **Earnings per Share:** $4.67 (vs. $4.52 expected)
* **Outlook:** Sales now expected to drop 3-4% this year (previously forecasted 1% decline)

Home Depot ($HD) is feeling the squeeze as consumers tighten their tool belts. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations for earnings and revenue, the home improvement titan had to cut its full-year sales forecast, blaming a “deferral mindset” among customers who are holding off on major projects until interest rates stop giving them heartburn. It turns out, people aren’t as eager to remodel their kitchens when borrowing costs are sky-high.

# Seven Quarters of Slumps—And Counting

Let’s talk numbers. Home Depot’s comparable sales have dipped for the seventh straight quarter, with a 3.3% decline this time around. Blame it on consumers who are spending less and waiting more. While pandemic lockdowns had everyone rushing to Home Depot to spruce up their spaces, today’s economic uncertainty has them second-guessing that new deck or bathroom redo. Instead, they’re opting for smaller, wallet-friendly projects—like painting a wall instead of tearing it down.

# Betting Big on the Long Game

But it’s not all doom and gloom. Home Depot is playing the long game, investing in its professional customer base and digital capabilities to weather the storm. The recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution, a supplier to professional contractors, is a big move in that direction. These pros are less likely to delay projects, making them a more reliable revenue stream. Plus, with investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure, Home Depot is setting itself up for future growth once the economy gets its groove back.

So, while the immediate future might look a little shaky, Home Depot is banking on a rebound—whenever that might be. In the meantime, they’ll keep hammering away at those long-term strategies.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the spotlight shifts to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the big brother of today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report.

CPI tracks the price changes of goods and services that hit your wallet directly. It’s a crucial gauge for the Federal Reserve as they monitor how their battle against inflation is shaping up. In June 2024, CPI climbed 3% year-over-year, following a 3.3% rise in May. For July, economists are betting on another 3% annual hike with a modest 0.2% increase from June.

Given the market’s volatility, a higher-than-expected CPI could trigger a wave of selling, while a lower number might spark investor enthusiasm, inching us closer to the Fed dialing back interest rates.

# After Market Close:

* **Cisco** ($CSCO) has been lagging behind its tech counterparts this year, missing out on the AI-driven rally that’s lifted many of its peers. The network infrastructure giant has faced challenges, including a round of layoffs and disappointing earnings last quarter, which haven't exactly inspired investor confidence. But don’t count them out just yet—Cisco still boasts a solid business model, has ramped up its cybersecurity game, and is now looking like an undervalued play. Wall Street is expecting $0.85 EPS and $13.54 billion in revenue for this quarter.",1723588480,830714,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,702ddb13b670630a1132b7c2c8c199fef5672df5a65ac1744f44303294664eb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1erl1s1/stock_market_recap_08132024_starbucks_taps/
2744,"Borealis Mining (BOGO.v) Pursues High-Grade Gold Exploration and Operational Expansion in Nevada, To Conduct Webinar Tomorrow at 1:05 PT ","Borealis Mining (TSXV: BOGO) is an emerging company recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, with a strategic focus on restarting its fully permitted Borealis heap leach gold mine in Nevada. Nevada is recognized as one of the top mining jurisdictions globally, offering a favorable environment for the company's ambitious growth plans.

https://preview.redd.it/kuscg9k1hiid1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b90e72977ff90512ce67b98778b33d64ac74f15



The Borealis Mine is a historically productive site, having previously yielded approximately 625,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.77 g/t. Currently, the mine is equipped with an operational processing facility, and its leach pad is actively generating gold from minor mining activities conducted between 2021 and 2022. With 4.2 million tons of leach pad space available before any expansion is required, Borealis Mining is well-positioned for a rapid operational ramp-up.



A significant stockpile of high-grade oxide material further enhances the site's potential. The company's immediate focus includes expanding its resource base through a targeted 3,500-meter drill program. This program is directed at both increasing the oxide resources and exploring high-grade high-sulphidation epithermal sulfides at depth.



The Borealis property is home to two types of mineralization: surface oxides and deeper, high-grade sulfides. Despite the site's historical production, it remains underexplored, with minimal drilling since 2012. Previous exploration efforts have delivered promising results, including intercepts of 67.1 meters at 6.1 g/t Au, 56.4 meters at 6.5 g/t Au, and 115.8 meters at 4.5 g/t Au. These results underscore the significant exploration potential that Borealis Mining aims to unlock.



Looking forward, Borealis Mining anticipates several key developments, including drill results, production-related announcements, and potential acquisitions. These future initiatives are supported by the company's $5 million in unrestricted cash, $4 million in restricted cash, and $2 million in ready-to-pour gold inventory. 



To provide more insights into these initiatives and engage with current and prospective investors, the company is hosting a webinar tomorrow at 1:05 PM PT / 4:05 PM ET.

2747,Noob question that might be the most noob of all,"some time ago i bought SMCI at $690/share. i then saw it dip to the low $500's recently so i bought 1 more share, i think right at $510.

i now have two shares w/an average cost of $600 (per robinhood).

i then sold 1 share, got back my $510, and it now shows my average cost, instead of being $690/share, now $600.

i highly doubt this is some extravagant cheat code but by buying and selling a share real quick for substantially less than the first, did that do anything for my account in terms of value since before the trade my avg cost was $690 and immediately after the avg cost stayed at $600?

2766,"Borealis Mining (BOGO.v) Pursues High-Grade Gold Exploration and Operational Expansion in Nevada, To Conduct Webinar Tomorrow, August 15th, at 1:05 PT ","Borealis Mining (TSXV: BOGO) is an emerging company recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, with a strategic focus on restarting its fully permitted Borealis heap leach gold mine in Nevada. Nevada is recognized as one of the top mining jurisdictions globally, offering a favorable environment for the company's ambitious growth plans.

https://preview.redd.it/uloswxymdoid1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8324e6088c256f91eda1256c362d01458bb69b9



The Borealis Mine is a historically productive site, having previously yielded approximately 625,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.77 g/t. Currently, the mine is equipped with an operational processing facility, and its leach pad is actively generating gold from minor mining activities conducted between 2021 and 2022. With 4.2 million tons of leach pad space available before any expansion is required, Borealis Mining is well-positioned for a rapid operational ramp-up.



A significant stockpile of high-grade oxide material further enhances the site's potential. The company's immediate focus includes expanding its resource base through a targeted 3,500-meter drill program. This program is directed at both increasing the oxide resources and exploring high-grade high-sulphidation epithermal sulfides at depth.



The Borealis property is home to two types of mineralization: surface oxides and deeper, high-grade sulfides. Despite the site's historical production, it remains underexplored, with minimal drilling since 2012. Previous exploration efforts have delivered promising results, including intercepts of 67.1 meters at 6.1 g/t Au, 56.4 meters at 6.5 g/t Au, and 115.8 meters at 4.5 g/t Au. These results underscore the significant exploration potential that Borealis Mining aims to unlock.



Looking forward, Borealis Mining anticipates several key developments, including drill results, production-related announcements, and potential acquisitions. These future initiatives are supported by the company's $5 million in unrestricted cash, $4 million in restricted cash, and $2 million in ready-to-pour gold inventory. 



To provide more insights into these initiatives and engage with current and prospective investors, the company is hosting a webinar tomorrow, August 15th, at 1:05 PM PT / 4:05 PM ET.

An opioid agonist that treats acute pain in adults when other treatments are ineffective. It's administered intravenously and can be used in conjunction with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). However, PCA can lead to adverse outcomes like respiratory depression, so patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and other side effects. OLINVYK should also not be used with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, as this can cause sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death.

2768,What is $30 Billion of Copper and Molybdenum Really Worth?: Libero Copper (LBC.v) Article Summary,"In his recent article on 321Gold, ""Libero Copper: What is $30 Billion of Copper and Moly Really Worth?"" Bob Moriarty delves into the potential undervaluation of Libero Copper (Ticker: LBC.v or LBCMF for US investors). 



Libero Copper owns the Mocoa copper and molybdenum project, a massive resource estimated at 4.6 billion pounds of copper and 511 million pounds of molybdenum. 

https://preview.redd.it/udg9idwcvpid1.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4bcb7809ed6ff6bd7ddc6ae4040d479739b6fbe



At current market prices, this resource holds an in-ground value of approximately $30 billion, yet the company's market capitalization is only around $12 million—a discrepancy that Moriarty finds striking.



Libero acquired the Mocoa project from B2 Gold in June 2018 for about $10 million, a deal that seems increasingly valuable given the project's potential.



 However, the project faced a major setback in January 2022 when the Colombian government introduced Resolution #110, restricting mining activities in the Regional Forest Reserve. 



Despite this, Libero continued to advance the project, reporting impressive drill results in April 2022.



The article highlights that while the Ministry of Environment's stance creates hurdles, local community support for the project remains robust, with the Community Action Board of Montclar  having unanimously endorsed a mutual benefit agreement with Libero.



In March 2024, Libero raised $2.86 million through a private placement, attracting notable mining investor Frank Giustra, who now holds an 11.2% stake in the company.



 Moriarty emphasizes Giustra's reputation for building successful mining companies and expresses confidence in Libero Copper's leadership under CEO Ian Harris, predicting that the company is well-positioned to succeed despite its current challenges.

2769,Stock Market Recap 08/14/2024: CPI Just Dropped + Mars To Acquire Kellanova + Cisco Earnings,"# Markets

* The Dow added 0.61% on Wednesday, cruising higher after some solid inflation data rolled in. The S&P 500 also kept the momentum going, notching its fifth straight win with a 0.38% bump, while the Nasdaq barely squeezed out a 0.03% gain.
* Inflation cooled a bit, with consumer prices rising just 2.9% year-over-year—the lowest since March 2021—keeping the Fed on track for a potential rate cut in September. While the market started the day mixed, the late-session rally showed that Wall Street is cautiously optimistic. But with more economic data on deck, traders are still keeping one eye on the exit.

# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Victoria’s Secret** ($VSCO) jumped 16.41% after the intimate apparel company named Hillary Super as chief executive, effective Sept. 9, and also raised its second-quarter adjusted earnings estimate.
* **Flutter** ($FLUT) climbed 8.09% as revenue and net income rose year-over-year, prompting the company to lift its outlook for full-year revenue. Flutter is the parent company of FanDuel.
* **Kellanova** ($K) surged 7.76% after Mars announced a deal to acquire the Pringles maker.
* **The Progressive Corporation** ($PGR) gained 5.4% following the release of strong financial results up until the end of July 2024.
* **Allstate** ($ALL) rose 5.23% after announcing a $2 billion cash deal to sell its employer voluntary-benefits business to StanCorp Financial.
* **Ferrari** ($RACE) increased 4.88% as the stock hit record highs, driven by rising profit estimates, stock buybacks, and EV ambitions.
* **Charles Schwab** ($SCHW) advanced 4.59% after reporting strong customer and asset growth in July, including $29 billion in core net new assets and 327,000 new brokerage accounts.

# What’s down 📉

* **Ouster** ($OUST) plummeted 27.67% as soft Q2 sales and downbeat guidance continued to drag the stock lower.
* **Mobileye** ($MBLY) fell 6.2% after insider purchases by the CEO failed to boost investor confidence in the company’s performance.
* **Etsy** ($ETSY) slid 4.74% amid activist pressure from Elliot Management.
* **Tesla** ($TSLA) dropped 3.10% as slower inflation and the potential for lower interest rates could lead to cheaper car prices.



# CPI Just Dropped…

Inflation? More like deflation. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report just hit, and it’s giving us the kind of cautiously optimistic vibes you get when something unexpectedly goes right—like a pleasant surprise, but with a side of skepticism, because you're waiting to see if it’s too good to be true.

# What You Need to Know:

* **Core CPI** (AKA inflation minus the wildcards like food and energy) rose 3.2% year-over-year—its chillest pace since early 2021. On a monthly basis, it edged up 0.2%, barely more than a rounding error compared to June’s numbers.
* **Overall inflation** bumped up 0.2% for the month and 2.9% from last year—a number we haven’t seen since early 2021. Nearly 90% of that monthly increase is thanks to shelter costs, which are doing their best to keep inflation from becoming too boring.
* **As for the Fed?** They’re still eyeing rate cuts like a kid in a candy store. Futures traders are betting on a full percentage point of cuts by year’s end, but a hefty 50-basis-point chop in September is looking less likely.

**The Housing Dilemma:** Shelter costs are like that one guest who won’t leave the party. They were responsible for nearly all of July’s inflation bump, with the shelter index rising 0.4% after June’s 0.2% uptick. Meanwhile, car insurance costs soared 1.2%, and food prices edged up 0.2%. But hey, energy prices, new cars, clothes, and airfares all decided to give your wallet a break.

**Market Vibes:** Wall Street barely flinched. Stock futures nudged upward, and Treasury yields inched higher. The yield curve flattened, suggesting the markets are still waiting to see if the Fed will play the role of Santa or the Grinch come September.

So, what’s next? Rate cuts are almost a done deal, but whether it’s a gentle 25-basis-point trim or a bold 50-pointer is still up in the air. Pro tip: If you’ve got cash parked in high-yield accounts, you might want to lock in those rates now before they start shrinking faster than summer vacation.

# Mars To Acquire Kellanova for $36 Billion in Snack Power Play

# A Bold Bite

Mars Inc., the king of candy with a portfolio that includes M&M’s and Snickers, is making its biggest move in nearly a decade by acquiring Kellanova, the snack behemoth behind Pringles and Cheez-Its, for a jaw-dropping $36 billion. This blockbuster deal prices Kellanova at $83.50 per share—a hefty 33% premium over its August 2nd stock price. Mars is clearly betting big on the future of snacking, and it’s not just about satisfying cravings. With cocoa prices skyrocketing, Mars is looking to diversify away from its chocolate-heavy lineup.

# Snacking Strategy: Go Big or Go Home

Kellanova, which split from Kellogg ($K) last year, has been on a winning streak, outperforming rivals and enjoying a 33% surge in stock value this year alone. With its impressive portfolio of globally recognized brands and a strong presence in emerging markets, Kellanova is the perfect snack-sized addition to Mars’ empire. Mars plans to double its snacking business over the next decade, leveraging Kellanova’s strength in regions like Africa while boosting its own presence in China. And don't worry, your favorite snacks like Cheez-Its and Pringles aren’t going anywhere—Mars has no plans to shake up the lineup.

# The Regulatory Maze

Now, about those potential roadblocks: While a deal of this magnitude usually sets off antitrust alarm bells, both Mars and Kellanova are confident they’ll navigate the regulatory landscape with ease. The two companies have minimal overlap, which should help them avoid any major pushback. But if things don’t go as planned, Mars could be on the hook for a $1.25 billion breakup fee—a bitter pill to swallow. Still, analysts believe the deal will likely go through, setting the stage for more mergers and acquisitions in the snack industry as companies scramble to keep up with changing consumer tastes and the push for global expansion.

This acquisition isn’t just about adding a few more snacks to Mars’ pantry—it’s about reshaping the future of the industry and staking a claim in the global market. As the saying goes, if you can’t beat ‘em, buy ‘em.

  


# Cisco Slashes 7% of Workforce, but Earnings Surprise on the Upside

# By the Numbers:

Here’s the lowdown on Cisco’s latest quarterly report and restructuring moves:

* **Layoffs:** 7% of global staff (around 6,000 jobs)
* **Earnings:** $0.87 per share (beating $0.85 expected)
* **Revenue:** $13.64 billion (vs. $13.54 billion predicted)
* **Networking Revenue:** Down 28% to $6.8 billion
* **Security Revenue:** Up 81% to $1.8 billion
* **Splunk’s Impact:** $960 million in revenue
* **Net Income:** Down 45% to $2.2 billion
* **Stock:** Down 10% YTD, but up 5.5% after hours

# The Layoff Shuffle

Cisco ($CSCO) is tightening its belt again, cutting 7% of its global workforce—about 6,000 jobs—in a bid to save $1 billion. This is the second major round of layoffs for the tech giant this year, following a 5% reduction back in February. So why the cuts? Cisco says it’s all about redirecting resources to “key growth opportunities” and making the business more efficient. In plain English, it’s time to trim the fat and focus on what’s actually working as the company navigates some choppy waters.

# Revenue Down, but Not Out

Despite reporting its third straight quarter of declining revenue, Cisco managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations. The company posted earnings of $0.87 per share, edging out the expected $0.85, while revenue came in slightly above forecasts at $13.64 billion. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows—Cisco’s bread-and-butter networking business is taking a hit, with revenue from switches and routers plummeting 28%. The ongoing shift of large enterprises to cloud services is eroding demand for Cisco’s traditional hardware, leaving the company scrambling to adapt.

# Splunk to the Rescue

Here’s where things get interesting. Cisco’s $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, a major player in data analytics and cybersecurity, is starting to pay off. The security segment saw an 81% surge in revenue, thanks in large part to Splunk, which contributed $960 million this quarter alone. As Cisco’s hardware sales continue to struggle, the company’s future seems increasingly tied to software and security. And the market seems to agree—Cisco’s stock popped 5.5% in after-hours trading, even though it’s still down 10% for the year.

Looking ahead, Cisco’s revenue slide isn’t expected to turn around overnight, but the company’s pivot toward more stable, subscription-based revenue through software and security could be its saving grace. For now, it’s all about weathering the storm and hoping that Splunk’s boost is enough to keep the ship afloat.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week still has a few reports left on the docket, but after today’s big CPI drop, the rest seem a bit underwhelming.

One key metric to keep an eye on is US retail sales, which are expected to tick up by about 0.3% for July. Retail sales have held up surprisingly well despite high inflation, helping the US dodge a recession so far. But if the job market is showing more cracks than expected, consumer spending could take a hit—and this report might reflect that shift.

We’ll also get updates from the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, and the Import Price Index (think of it as the quirky cousin of CPI and PPI).

# Before Market Open:

* **Walmart** ($WMT), the nation’s retail giant, just keeps getting bigger. The company’s making serious moves in e-commerce and is planning to integrate AI across its supply chain. Add to that steady growth at Sam’s Club and solid margins despite inflation, and it’s easy to see why 27 of 30 Wall Street analysts have Walmart as a buy. The consensus: $0.64 EPS and $168.57 billion in revenue.
* **Alibaba** ($BABA), often dubbed China’s Amazon, hasn’t seen much stock movement this year. Investors are eager to hear how the company plans to navigate China’s ongoing economic slowdown and explore growth opportunities abroad. If Alibaba delivers the right message, its current low valuation could set the stage for a significant rally. The consensus: $2.11 EPS and $34.46 billion in revenue.",1723686326,830690,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,6ebce1ebf7a2ccb25eea7c8b53be40ad895e3a74b674ee1a7ce733692fde947e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1esj257/stock_market_recap_08142024_cpi_just_dropped_mars/

2773,🚀🚀 Why This NASDAQ Stock Just Soared 🚀🚀 More Info 🚀🚀,"Key Points:
1. Big Money Is Flocking In: A major trade is heating up.
2. Government Legislation Sparks Surge: New laws are behind this NASDAQ stock’s meteoric rise.
3. Undervalued Gem: A lesser-known company stands to benefit massively.

The Buzz:
Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (GNLN) just went through the roof after announcing a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to become the exclusive U.S. distributor for Safety Strips Tech Corp’s fentanyl, xylazine, and drink spike detection test strips. 🧪🚨

Why This Is HUGE:
California just passed new legislation requiring bars and nightclubs to offer test kits for detecting date rape drugs. 📜🍸 This new law is creating a massive demand for these test kits, and while everyone’s eyeing the big players, there’s a smaller, stealthier company in the mix that’s about to cash in big time.

The Real Deal:
Safety Strips Tech Corp might be a private company, but the real play is Safe Supply (CSE: SPLY). This publicly traded company owns a chunk of Safety Strips and is set to reap huge rewards. 🌟💸 Safety Strips has patents and tech ready for mass-scale production in California, and the law is mandating these kits be used. The company gets a cut every time these kits are sold, which could mean serious $$$. 

Why This Could Be a Game-Changer:
Legislation + exclusive tech rights = potential goldmine. Analysts are buzzing about this as a turning point for explosive growth, and if you’re not in the know yet, you might want to dig into Safety Strips and SPLY.

TL;DR:
- GNLN is soaring because of a new distribution deal.
- Safety Strips Tech Corp is the tech behind the surge.
- Safe Supply (SPLY) holds a stake in Safety Strips and stands to benefit massively.
- New California laws create a HUGE demand for test kits.

2776,"MSOS - 8/15 update - catalyst/characteristics - be early, not late to the game","First, a couple fun facts:  
Fun Fact [#1](https://stocktwits.com/topic/1): 85% of [$MSOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSOS) positions (weighting) have juicer GMs than [$AAPL](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AAPL) (ex: TCNNF 60% vs. 46%).

Fun Fact [#2](https://stocktwits.com/topic/2): Just 1% of [$NVDA](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/NVDA) trade rotating would skyrocket [$MSOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSOS) to $250 (retail crowded in tech/AI trade ... even as HFs sold out).

MSOS Characteristics:  
(1) Multiples today: Nearly all holdings w/ PTs +100% to +400% (see prev post below for more).

(2) Oligopolies: Limited license states + smaller players can't compete w/multi-state operator scale.

(3) Global first mover advantage: Germany only major econ to legalize. MSOs starting to become MCOs (multi-country operators).

(4) Diversified growth: Domestic + international growth (CURLF reported 78% interntl growth).

(5) Expanding margins: 85% of MSOS basket reported expanding margins (GTBIF, TCNNF, CURLF, VRNOF).

(6) Catalyst 1: Ohio rec sales began 2 wks ago. Not priced in.

a. AYRWF: reports +700% in rev.  
b. Cresco: Cincinnatti store now busiest in country.  
c. CBSTF: Analyst placed +180% PT on just Ohio.

(7) Catalyst 2: Florida rec sales  
If Ohio a big deal (+180% CBSTF PT), then FL ([#1](https://stocktwits.com/topic/1) tourism state), is MASSIVE.

So big, analyst has +400% PT on AYRWF when rec sales begin.

TCNNF with SAAS gross margins, is the largest operator in FL and still trades at $10 (Cannacord raised PT to $27.70).

(8) Catalyst 3: Large states will (PA, TX, WI, GA etc).

(9) Cashflows and buybacks: GTBIF (largest MSOS weighting), on 2nd repurchase authorization. Repurchased 1,658,000 in Q2.

(10). Catalyst 4: DEA re-scheduling. 99% done. So done, a senator tweeted ""was"" right thing to do, days or weeks but NOT months away.

(11). Outdated Narrative pricing: [$MSOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSOS) no longer a trade. Majors are now cash printing oligopolies (grew to become giants BECAUSE of legalization delays).

So, retail bought at $50 when worth $8 and waited to buy at $8, when worth $50.

(12) Institutional funds flow:  
HF flows a tell on how & where retail is batshit crazy.

Hedge funds sold tech/AI at 2008 GFC panic levels while DOUBLING [$MSOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSOS) stake in less than a yr. HFs swapped out assets en masse.

(13) Analysts raising PTs.  
Majority of [$MSOS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSOS) basket seeing raises (TCNNF, GTBIF, CBSTF, etc).

(14) Recession proof: More people use cannabis now than alcohol.

(15) Normalization resulting in secular growth market. Soccer mom recommended THC gummies for sleep, on a dating app, girl says if nothing else works, she goes for the gummies.

TLDR : buy $10 calls for Dec/Jan

2788,Taking a look deep into $LVO ,"Hello my favorite community of WallStreetBettors....

$LVO rose 5% yesterday, so I wanted to do some knowledge sharing with you all...

$LVO had earnings on Tuesday and although it wasn't mind-blowing, their revenue was up 19% y-o-y, which is always a sign of optimism. LiveOne reported a fiscal quarter loss of 2 cents per share, but seemed to match analysts estimates.

Without further a due, here's the full scoop on LiveOne Entertainment....

**Intro to LiveOne (LVO)**

**LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ: LVO)** IPO’d back in 2012, but it’s only recently that they’ve transformed their LiveOne entertainment platform.

The platform offers various music options, both live and recorded, free for any user with or without an account.

Similar to Spotify and Pandora, LiveOne generates revenue from ads shown to users who haven’t subscribed to their premium options, encouraging them to become paying customers.

What’s unique compared to traditional music streaming platforms is that LiveOne offers LIVE pay-per-view events that you wouldn’t typically find through a traditional cable service. They also provide both free and subscription-based access to popular podcasts and radio streams—a platform for all-in-one entertainment.

Their platform is available on popular streaming services like Roku, AppleTV, and Amazon Fire TV.

**Market Position**

LVO’s share price has been volatile over the last 12 months, but it has shown some bullish strength and consolidation lately, sitting at $1.48/share.

While they’re entering a crowded space with many companies moving to streaming platforms (like Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, etc.), the unique digital access that LiveOne offers gives them potential to make an impact in this saturated market.

In addition to ad and subscription revenue, LiveOne also has its own line of merchandise that adds to their bottom line.

**Financial Report**

LiveOne’s revenue increased by 18% from their 2023 mark of $99,611, which is positive despite their EPS decline to -$0.21 from -$0.14 over the same period.

However, the company has seen significant profit growth from 2022, where their GPM increased from $24,039 to $32,049 in 2023—a notable 33% jump year over year.

# Key Highlights

* Signed an exclusive multi-year deal with celebrity medium Johnathan Mark to launch a top-tier podcast with PodcastOne, a newly acquired partner of LiveOne. This is just the beginning of their celebrity collaborations.
* LiveOne generates international engagement from markets in Asia, Europe, and beyond.
* Their library of franchises across music and podcasts continues to grow.
* Livestream demand is constantly increasing.

I hope everyone enjoyed the read!

2792,Video Summary Post: The KE Report & Erik Wetterling of The Hedgeless Horseman Highlight NexGold Mining Corp. (NEXG.v) as a Prime Example of the Precious Metals Consolidation Trend,"In the recent video titled ""Erik Wetterling – The Recent M&A Transactions Are A Shot Across The Bow In Precious Metals Sector"" The KE Report and Erik Wetterling, Founder and Editor of The Hedgeless Horseman, delve into the transformative impact of recent mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the precious metals industry. Among the companies discussed, NexGold Mining Corp. (Ticker: NEXG.v or NXGCF for US investors) emerged as a significant player in the ongoing consolidation trend.



NexGold Mining Corp. is a gold-focused exploration and development company with a strong foothold in Canada, specifically in Northwestern Ontario. The company was formed through the strategic merger of Treasury Metals Inc. and Blackwolf Copper and Gold Ltd., a move designed to create a more substantial entity capable of attracting major producers and investors. This merger underscores NexGold's ambition to evolve into a mid-tier gold miner, leveraging its combined resources and projects to solidify its position in the market.

Central to NexGold’s growth strategy is its 100%-owned Goliath Gold Complex, located 20 kilometers east of Dryden, Ontario. The Goliath Gold Complex, which includes the Goliath, Goldlund, and Miller projects, has been partially permitted and is advancing towards near-term production.



The project boasts impressive Pre-Feasibility Study economics, with a Net Present Value of $652 million at a 5% discount rate and an Internal Rate of Return of 41.1% at a gold price of US$2,150 per ounce. The Goliath Gold Complex is slated to become one of Canada’s next producing gold mines, benefiting from its location in a stable, mining-friendly jurisdiction with excellent infrastructure.



The merger and subsequent formation of NexGold Mining Corp. is a prime example of the ongoing consolidation within the precious metals sector, as companies seek to mass up and create larger, more competitive entities. 



As discussed in the video, these mergers not only enhance the value proposition for investors but also position companies like NexGold as attractive targets for future acquisitions or as leaders in the development of new mining projects.



Wetterling’s insights highlight the broader implications of these M&A activities, suggesting that the industry is entering a phase where only the most strategically positioned companies will thrive. 



NexGold’s focus on near-term production, exploration, and consolidation positions it as a key player in this evolving landscape, with the potential to deliver significant value to its shareholders as it advances its projects towards production.

2797,Canada: A Great Place to Find Undervalued Cybersecurity Plays Potentially NASDAQ Bound,"The cybersecurity space is exploding - as logically, it needs to move hand-in-hand with the AI space. And where is a great place to find hidden tech gems?...Canada. The country thinks small, has a poignant lack of investor money for microcap/smallcap - and gives nowhere near the valuations awarded in the US.



Although Plurilock Security trades on the TSX.v (PLUR) and in the US (under PLCKF) - it is NOT a Canadian deal. Almost all the revenue and their people are south of the 49th parallel. And as  an astute poster put it on a social I read this AM, “SMART investors align with Wall Street, not ‘Howe Street.’”



Big buyers are now coming in from all over - as they undoubtedly feel this play is very quickly going to NASDAQ. Even after swift gains on huge volume, Plurilock is still valued only a little over a 1X…Revenues are \~$70M and after Friday’s gain, the Market Cap is still only CAD $98M.



Government VAR - ARR businesses with the type of clientele that Plurilock has trade at 4-6X revenues / managed critical services 8-14X revenues and AI CYBER patented software trade at 20-200 depending on run rate. This is a “Platform 10/60/90.” 



Anyone walking into the DOD and looking for a cybersecurity deal must be deeply vetted and have years with them. Plurilock has created an endpoint-to-endpoint tech enabled (distribution, services and software) sales platform.



Private cybersecurity play, Wiz: Just turned down $23B (a 65X) from Google - and are looking instead to try to get more in a go-public.



Private cybersecurity play, Abnormal Security: Just closed a $250M Series D funding round, giving them a 25X.



Private Canadian cybersecurity play, eSentire: Is weighing a $1B sale (including debt) that would give them a 7X.



Bottom Line re Plurilock Security: Their VAR business alone is worth multiples of market cap, as companies would give anything to own their clients…

2808,"OCG.v Reports Promising Drilling Results at Aguilar Vein in Santa Ana Silver Project, Unveiling High-Grade Silver Intercepts & New Parallel Vein Discovery","Recent drilling results from the Aguilar vein discovery at Outcrop Silver & Gold Corp.'s Santa Ana Silver Project (Ticker: OCG.v or OCGSF for US investors) have demonstrated promising advancements. Situated 5 kilometers south of the existing resource within a 30-kilometer vein corridor, this discovery is proving to be a vital enhancement to the project.



The drilling findings affirm the presence of high-grade silver in the Aguilar vein and reveal the existence of a new parallel vein, designated Aguilar-HW. This new vein presents opportunities for further substantial discoveries in the region, emphasizing the strong mineralization in the area.

Key highlights from the latest drilling include:

* A significant interval of **6.52m returning 828 g/t of silver equivalent**
* Within this interval, a sub-interval of **0.63 meters exceeded 6,900 g/t AgEq**, showcasing the quality of the mineralization
* Confirming the extension of Aguilar North at depth, **1.11m of 969 g/t AgEq & 0.31m of 3,741 g/t AgEq** was intercepted 
* Another hole intercepted **1.04m of 1,218 g/t AgEq** in a new blind discovery

https://preview.redd.it/k5ttzeo5dpjd1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d261ea81a3545d7e9f33a84dcf31e41d978aa5a



Outcrop Silver's targeted exploration strategy focuses on rapidly expanding resources at the Santa Ana project. The company’s proactive step-out drilling efforts have unveiled the substantial potential of the Aguilar vein system, revealing a complex network of parallel veins and splays that signify extensive mineralization.



Notably, the presence of blind veins, which are not visible at the surface, indicate potential for additional undiscovered mineralization in the vicinity. 



Guillermo Hernandez, VP of Exploration, emphasized the significance of these results, suggesting that the latest drill holes could lead to the identification of even more blind veins. The Aguilar vein system appears to be robust, with multiple parallel veins and splays yielding encouraging results, indicating a strong outlook for the ongoing drilling campaign.



Currently, Outcrop Silver is employing two active drill rigs on-site, continuing the drilling initiative aimed at expanding on the initial successes. The focus remains on confirming and increasing the high-grade mineralization already discovered, particularly regarding the new Aguilar-HW vein.

# Carl Icahn’s $2M 'Oops' Moment: SEC Slaps His Wrist

# Icahn’s Costly Oversight

Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor known for his high-stakes moves, just found himself on the wrong side of the SEC. The agency slapped him and his investment firm, Icahn Enterprises ($IEP), with a $2 million fine. The reason? Icahn failed to disclose billions in personal margin loans backed by his stake in the company. Icahn himself will pay $500,000, while Icahn Enterprises is on the hook for $1.5 million.

This all started when Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-seller, dropped a bombshell report in 2023. The report claimed that IEP was grossly overvalued and hinted at some shady financial practices. IEP shares plummeted, catching the SEC’s attention. What they found was that Icahn had pledged up to 65% of his IEP units as collateral for personal loans totaling up to $5.1 billion. These pledges, made between 2018 and 2022, went largely unnoticed by investors because Icahn didn’t bother to update his securities filings—until July 2023, well after Hindenburg’s report had already done its damage.

Icahn is now in full damage control, stating he’s “glad to put this matter behind us” and insists that the SEC settlement doesn’t imply that he or IEP engaged in any shady dealings like inflating asset values or running a “Ponzi-like” structure. However, Hindenburg isn’t backing down. On social media, they doubled down on their claims, accusing IEP of still operating in a questionable manner and reiterating their short position on the stock.

# The Fallout Continues

While Icahn may want to move on, the fallout isn’t over yet. IEP’s stock took a 6% hit on the news of the SEC settlement (but ended the day in the green up 1.25%), adding to the ongoing pressure from both regulators and short-sellers. This episode serves as a stark reminder that even Wall Street legends like Icahn aren’t immune to the repercussions of overlooking/dismissing the fine print altogether. Investors, take note: transparency isn’t just a good practice—it’s the law. And when you miss the mark, it can cost you, even if your name is Carl Icahn.

# Palo Alto Networks Surges on Strong Forecast and Buyback Boost

# Sales Surge Despite Spending Fatigue

Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) just gave Wall Street a pleasant surprise. The cybersecurity giant posted a profit forecast for the current quarter that beat expectations, with earnings projected between $1.47 and $1.49 per share—comfortably ahead of analysts’ predictions of $1.43. This upbeat outlook, combined with a 12% sales growth last quarter, sent shares soaring up to 5% in post-market trading and ended the day up 2.77%. The company’s market cap now stands at a robust $111 billion, up from $91 billion at the start of the year.

This marks a significant rebound for Palo Alto after a rough patch earlier this year when CEO Nikesh Arora warned of ""spending fatigue"" among customers. That warning, coupled with a miss on annual sales expectations, had sent the stock plunging by 27%. But it looks like the company has turned a corner, with its recent performance suggesting that cybersecurity is back on the priority list for many companies, especially after a major outage linked to rival CrowdStrike ($CRWD).

# $1 Billion Buyback Bonanza

In addition to the rosy profit forecast, Palo Alto’s board greenlit an extra $500 million for its share repurchase program, doubling the total buyback authorization to a whopping $1 billion. This move is a clear signal of confidence from the company’s leadership, showing that they believe in the stock’s future growth potential.

CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized the importance of cybersecurity in a post-CrowdStrike outage world, noting that Palo Alto’s approach to updates is ""fundamentally different"" and more secure. With customers now more cautious, Palo Alto seems well-positioned to capitalize on any shifts in the market.

# Shifting Metrics and a New Strategy

One notable change: Palo Alto’s CFO Dipak Golechha announced the company will no longer issue guidance on billings forecasts, which had been a contentious point with investors. Instead, the focus will shift to annualized recurring revenue and remaining performance obligations (RPO). While some on Wall Street, like Guggenheim Securities, have raised concerns about relying too heavily on RPO due to its lack of time frame clarity, Palo Alto is confident this shift will provide a clearer picture of its long-term growth prospects.

Overall, Palo Alto Networks appears to be back on track, with a strong forecast, a hefty buyback, and a strategy shift that could keep investors intrigued as the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve.

# Tomorrow

# Before Market Open: 

* **Lowe’s ($LOW)**: Like its competitor Home Depot, Lowe’s straddles the line between consumer spending and the housing market—both of which are feeling the strain. Home Depot’s recent earnings report highlighted a dip in home renovation spending, dragging Lowe’s shares down with it. While Lowe’s management held steady on its full-year outlook last quarter, any shift in that stance could spark a selloff. Expectations are set at $4.00 EPS and $23.96 billion in revenue.
* **Medtronic ($MDT)**: Medtronic’s shares have been relatively flat this year, but investors are optimistic about the medical device giant’s prospects. The company exceeded analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings last quarter, and a promising pipeline could help it stay competitive in a tough market. Plus, with 47 consecutive years of dividend increases, Medtronic gives shareholders a solid reason to stick around during slower growth periods. The consensus is $1.24 EPS and $8 billion in revenue.

Maybe I can short it at the top of what I've got drawn out, but if you guys think I can still make a decent long position here I’d love the reassurance.

Besides that, LiveOne Inc. ($LVO ) just keeps dropping catalyst after catalyst like their company depends on it lol.

Over the weekend, the now considered “premier” streaming platform for live audio and visual entertainment announced a multi-year partnership with… TextNow??? The company stated that TextNow users will now have access to LiveOne’s premium, ad-free, high-def, unlimited skip and exclusive access membership as a bonus for using the paid texting service. Chief Growth Officer Ken Wilner is optimistic LiveOne’s partnership will make TextNow an invaluable form of communication.

On top of that, LiveOne is set to expand their B2B team from 6 to 10 employees pending the hiring process. Definitely a necessary feat for the company considering the abundance of strategic acquisitions in 2024.

Safe to say I’ll be watching Yahoo Finance throughout the week to see which company or artist they partner with next.

2829,"West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd.(WRLG.v) Launches 2024 Drilling Program at Madsen Mine Today, Targeting High-Grade Gold Zones in Red Lake District","Today, West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for US investors) announced the initiation of its 2024 surface drilling program at the Madsen Mine Property in the Red Lake Gold District, Northwestern Ontario. 



The program is set to cover 10,000 meters of NQ diamond drilling, focusing on several high-priority targets identified through a thorough evaluation of geological data.



Notably, the Madsen Mine currently hosts an Indicated resource of 1.65 million ounces of gold, with an additional Inferred resource of 0.37 million ounces,



WRLG's exploration strategy revolves around testing targets based on their location along key structural trends, proximity to the Russet Lake and Venus ultramafic units, and alignment with known mineralized splays along the Madsen structural corridor.



 The exploration team, led by Will Robinson, Vice President of Exploration, has identified new targets that share geological characteristics with known resource areas, potentially hosting high-grade gold mineralization.



Key targets include:



* *Upper 8:* Positioned within the Russet Lake Ultramafic unit, this target is a shallower analog to the high-grade 8-Zone, located 750m up-plunge. Previous drilling indicated strong shearing, alteration, and quartz veining, but the area remains underexplored.



* *MJ:* A high-grade portion of the Wedge resource, the MJ target is characterized by deformed gold-bearing quartz veins within altered basalt and peridotite. The structure has been delineated over 500m of strike length and remains open for further exploration.



* *North Venus:* Located 2km northeast of the North Austin zone, this target shows a magnetic signature similar to the Fork splay. The area's geophysical features and proximity to significant geological structures make it a promising exploration site.



* *North Starratt:* This target is near the historic Starratt Mine, the second-largest producer on the Madsen property. The exploration will focus on the northeast extension of the Starratt mine trend, an area that has seen minimal drilling.

WRLG's drilling efforts are backed by a robust quality assurance and quality control program, ensuring precision and accuracy in sample analysis.



The 2024 drilling program aims to uncover new high-grade zones, adding value to the Madsen property and contributing to WRLG's goal of making significant discoveries in the Red Lake Gold District.

2832,Google humanoid robot ushered in a new breakthrough; WiMi starts to develop industrial applications ,"The Google (GOOG) team has developed a table tennis robot that can reach the level of human amateur table tennis players.

Table tennis robot products appeared

According to the team, this is the first learning robot agent to reach the level of human amateurs in a table tennis competition. The main body is a six-axis robotic arm, which can be moved from front to back through the bottom slide. In 29 races against humans, robots won 13, with a win rate of 45%.



In order to achieve human-level speed and performance, the team has adopted a layered and modular strategy architecture that allows the robot to not only master “low-level skills” such as forehand topspin and backhand push, but also develop strategies through an “advanced controller” equivalent to the brain. In the future, they will try to further improve the performance of the robot by improving the control algorithms and optimizing the hardware.



Humanoid robots started early and have been more common in science fiction and movies. However, in the real world, it began to emerge in recent years with the development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. With the support of the large model of artificial intelligence, the new members of robots show a new trend of interaction, autonomy and versatility.

 

A steady stream of new breakthroughs

Just last week, artificial intelligence robotics startup Figure AI unveiled its new second-generation humanoid robot Figure 02. When the Figure 01 was released in March, it drew intense attention. Before the launch, the Figure 02 humanoid robot had been “practicing” at the BMW Group’s Spartanburg plant for several weeks.



According to the introduction, the second generation of the Figure 02 is even more amazing. As can be seen from the official video released, compared with the first generation, the Figure 02 is more delicate in appearance. The exoskeleton structure, the robot’s power supply and computing wiring are integrated into the body, thus improving the reliability of the robot and making the packaging more compact.

Moreover, the humanoid robot track is packed with giants. In April, a new version of Atlas was unveiled; in May, Tesla released the latest video of the humanoid robot Optimus, showing its ability to sort batteries and perform factory tasks, with strategic investment from several institutions.

The global humanoid robot industry is bustling. According to Goldman Sachs, under the ideal situation of revolutionary technological breakthroughs, the compound annual growth rate of global humanoid robot sales will reach 94% from 2025 to 2035, and the market size will reach $154 billion in 2035.

 

A more optimistic forecast suggests that in the current explosion of generative artificial intelligence technology, humanoid robots are likely to achieve greater growth, and the next trillion-level “blue ocean” is imminent.

Humanoid robots may not be a very futuristic track, but the capital market continues to bet on humanoid robots, which is the most intuitive. After all, promoting the development of humanoid robots will become an important driving force for enterprise innovation, but also an important industrial model to promote the digital transformation and intelligent upgrading of all walks of life.



WiMi explores the whole industrial chain

At present, the global humanoid robot industry is showing a booming trend. WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), relying on its strong research team in the field of AI and rich research results in many fields, its humanoid robot industry is undoubtedly an outstanding representative of it. It is reported that WiMi is based on the development of cutting-edge technologies such as large model and physical intelligence, especially the first breakthrough in the field of multimodal model applied in the humanoid robot, which greatly expands the development space of the humanoid robot industry.

WiMi has always listed humanoid robots as one of the key future industries for development, and the research and development of humanoid robots has also entered the fast track. At present, through years of standardized development of technology and industry, WiMi has opened up the whole chain and industrial chain from technology research and development to manufacturing and service, and created the innovation highland of the humanoid robot industry.

The development of humanoid robot industry cannot be separated from a good industrial ecology. In the next step, WiMi will continue to focus on the core technology breakthrough, achievement transformation and industrialization, and do a good job of “hard support” in the upstream and downstream industrial chains. Therefore, it will continue to promote the high-quality development of humanoid robot industry in the future.

 

To sum up

The market behind the humanoid robot is very broad. With the explosive leap of “artificial intelligence + big model” technology, such a huge market naturally attracts the giants to make heavy bets. From the perspective of development trend, in the future, with the promotion of products, industries and policies, the commercialization of humanoid robots will be accelerated to realize the leap from technology to application.",1724224714,830990,Oops-cat,t2_o2dpzoe30,0a557a87cd2dc8515615ac0af9ff7fc6427d2856814705c14baced6d140a2a69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1exjbex/google_humanoid_robot_ushered_in_a_new/

2840,What is your strategy if Kamala wins and pushes the 44.6% capital gain tax policy? Do you sell LTCG in 2024 to lock in the current 20% LTCG rates or hodl into 2025 and risk paying higher capital gains taxes.  ,"I have a few hundred thousand in long term capital gains. My current LTCG tax rate is the 20% plus the 3.8% on long term gains.    Yes I understand tax law changes need to be passed and enacted into law and it is likely that it will take agreement by both parties, and I also understand that the current tax policies being proposed will most likely not be the final form if ever passed.  Nonetheless, I think its a question worth asking, and how should one plan the rest of your 2024 calendar year. Worst case scenario for me is I'm in the 44.6% capital gain tax bracket.  Best case scenario for me is nothing gets done because of the disagreement between parties on tax policy, but with a number of trump tax era tax laws expiring in 2025, I feel like whoever wins, there will be a number of tax law changes in 2025.  My question is if Kamala wins, is anyone considering cashing out long term gains in 2024? I do not really want to sell these holdings, but I also don't care to pay several thousands of dollars of extra tax when I do sell my positions.  I'm not sure what I would do, and trying to plan ahead. I'm curious if others have given this any thought.

2846,Sharing the Rich History and Future Potential of the Golden Triangle + Nations Royalty's (NRC's) Strategic Royalties in the Region's Key Projects,"As highlighted in a recent Twitter Space with Shawn Khunkhun, the CEO and President of Dolly Varden Silver, the Golden Triangle is a very high-potential region for precious metals exploration with a rich production history. Listen: https://x.com/SilverVarden/status/1823203577235685670



This region's significance dates back to the early 20th century, with notable discoveries such as the Premier Gold Mine, which began operations in 1918 and was once called ""one of the greatest silver and gold mines in the world.""



With gold prices remaining high and modern discoveries like Seabridge's KSM project, the Golden Triangle is once again attracting significant interest from the mining sector. The combination of historical richness and modern advancements like improved infrastructure positions the Golden Triangle as one of the most promising regions for resource development globally.



Nations Royalty Corp. (Ticker: NRC.v) is tapping into this renewed interest in the Golden Triangle by securing royalty interests in some of the region's most significant projects.



As a pioneering force in the Indigenous royalty sector, NRC has strategically positioned itself to benefit from the ongoing developments in the Golden Triangle. 



The company's portfolio includes royalty interests in key projects such as the aforementioned KSM and the Premier Gold Projects—assets located on  Nisga’a Nation lands. 

https://preview.redd.it/lnllh5ixn3kd1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7cd050600d68ee9743363aa379eb23e90298fe



These royalty interests, totaling a net asset value of $214 million, provide NRC with exposure to 

high-grade gold revenue from the Brucejack Mine, potential future production from the large KSM deposit, and the newly operational Premier Gold Project. 



With continued advancements, such as Ascot Resources reaching full commercial production at the Premier Gold Project and Seabridge Gold's progress on the KSM Project, NRC is well-positioned to benefit from the Golden Triangle’s ongoing development. 



Additionally, infrastructure improvements, including the $195 million allocated for Highway 37 upgrades, are expected to further enhance the region's growth prospects, making NRC's involvement in these projects even more valuable.

2852,West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (WRLG.v) Launches 2024 Drilling Campaign at Madsen Mine Property,"On Tuesday, West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v, WRLGF for U.S. investors) announced the commencement of its 2024 surface drilling initiative at the Madsen Mine Property, located in the Red Lake Gold District of Northwestern Ontario. This drilling program is designed to span 10,000 meters using NQ diamond drilling technology, focusing on several high-priority exploration targets identified through comprehensive geological data analysis.



**Resource Overview**

The Madsen Mine currently boasts an Indicated resource of 1.65 million ounces of gold, supplemented by an Inferred resource of 0.37 million ounces. WRLG’s exploration strategy is centered around testing targets strategically selected for their location along significant structural trends, proximity to the Russet Lake and Venus ultramafic units, and alignment with known mineralized splays along the Madsen structural corridor.



**Exploration Strategy and Targets**

Under the leadership of Will Robinson, Vice President of Exploration, the team has pinpointed new targets that share geological similarities with established resource areas, offering potential for high-grade gold mineralization, these include: 

* *Upper 8:* An underexplored area where previous drilling revealed strong shearing, alteration, and quartz veining.
* *MJ:* A high-grade section of the Wedge resource with gold-bearing quartz veins within altered basalt and peridotite, extending over 500 meters.
* *North Venus:* Positioned 2 kilometers northeast of North Austin, this target shows a magnetic signature similar to the Fork splay and has promising geological features.
* *North Starratt:* Near the historic Starratt Mine, this target focuses on the northeast extension of the mine trend, with minimal prior drilling.

2857,Could following Elon Musk’s market influence be a viable strategy for profiting? ,"

There’s a strategy floating around that might sound wild but could be worth considering: tracking influencers like Elon Musk. The basic idea? Buy stocks when they dip after one of his infamous tweets, then sell when they bounce back. If you time it right, the payoff can be huge.

**But, here’s the thing:**

This isn’t without risk. You’re basically betting on one person’s unpredictable behavior, and if it doesn’t go the way you expect, you could end up in the red. Plus, you need to stay on top of the market constantly, which can be exhausting. And let’s not forget—the market isn’t just about what one guy says; there’s a lot more at play.

**So, what’s the verdict?**

**Pros:**  
- The potential for quick, significant profits if you get the timing right.  
- You’re capitalizing on the moves of a known market influencer.

**Cons:**  
- High risk if things don’t pan out as expected.  
- It requires constant attention and quick reflexes.  
- Other market forces can easily throw a wrench in your plan.

**Examples:**  

**Positive:** Some traders have made a nice chunk of change by buying the dip and riding the recovery after Musk’s tweets.  

**Negative:** On the flip side, others have taken losses when the market didn’t bounce back as expected—or when the dip just kept dipping.

At the end of the day, while the potential for gains is there, so are the risks. So, is it worth the gamble, or are you better off sticking to something more stable?",1724372622,831054,I-am-ALIVE--,t2_ocm7hr0b,3e199376ce5ea0ed7d3c7c313d12264da3923f61285ca29293d0f817db1a0845,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1eyz28c/could_following_elon_musks_market_influence_be_a/

**Intro to LiveOne (LVO)**

**LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ: LVO)** IPO’d back in 2012, but it’s only recently that they’ve transformed their LiveOne entertainment platform.

The platform offers various music options, both live and recorded, free for any user with or without an account.

Similar to Spotify and Pandora, LiveOne generates revenue from ads shown to users who haven’t subscribed to their premium options, encouraging them to become paying customers.

What’s unique compared to traditional music streaming platforms is that LiveOne offers LIVE pay-per-view events that you wouldn’t typically find through a traditional cable service. They also provide both free and subscription-based access to popular podcasts and radio streams—a platform for all-in-one entertainment.

Their platform is available on popular streaming services like Roku, AppleTV, and Amazon Fire TV.

**Market Position**

LVO’s share price has been volatile over the last 12 months, but it has shown some bullish strength and consolidation lately, sitting at $1.48/share.

While they’re entering a crowded space with many companies moving to streaming platforms (like Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, etc.), the unique digital access that LiveOne offers gives them potential to make an impact in this saturated market.

In addition to ad and subscription revenue, LiveOne also has its own line of merchandise that adds to their bottom line.

**Financial Report**

LiveOne’s revenue increased by 18% from their 2023 mark of $99,611, which is positive despite their EPS decline to -$0.21 from -$0.14 over the same period.

However, the company has seen significant profit growth from 2022, where their GPM increased from $24,039 to $32,049 in 2023—a notable 33% jump year over year.

# Key Highlights

* Signed an exclusive multi-year deal with celebrity medium Johnathan Mark to launch a top-tier podcast with PodcastOne, a newly acquired partner of LiveOne. This is just the beginning of their celebrity collaborations.
* LiveOne generates international engagement from markets in Asia, Europe, and beyond.
* Their library of franchises across music and podcasts continues to grow.
* Livestream demand is constantly increasing.

I hope everyone enjoyed the read!

2866,"Libero Copper & Gold’s Mocoa Copper-Molybdenum Project: Resource Estimates, Government Backing, and Future Outlook","Libero Copper & Gold Corp. (Ticker: LBC.v or LBCMF for US investors) holds a key asset in its portfolio—the Mocoa copper-molybdenum porphyry deposit, situated in the resource-rich region of Putumayo, Colombia.

\*



**Historical Exploration and Resource Estimates**

The Mocoa deposit was first identified in the 1970s, leading to a series of exploration activities. These efforts culminated in a positive, albeit non-compliant, pre-feasibility study. Recent exploration by Libero Copper & Gold has revealed significant mineralization, including an impressive 840 meters of 0.72% copper equivalent (CuEq), emphasizing the deposit’s potential.



**Current Resource Estimate:**

* Inferred resource: 636 million tonnes at 0.45% CuEq
* Contains: 4.6 billion pounds of Copper, 511 million pounds of Molybdenum
* Copper grade: 0.33%
* Molybdenum grade: 0.036%



**Government Support and Strategic Development**

The local government in Mocoa has demonstrated strong support for the project through the introduction of a Territorial Development Plan. This plan prioritizes sustainable development in the region, with a particular focus on the mining and energy sectors. Key elements of the plan include:

* Emphasis on strategic metals, particularly copper, in the Ticuanayoy basin, where the Mocoa deposit is located.
* Repeal of previous regulations that may have obstructed mining activities.
* Promotion of community wellbeing and sustainable resource development.



**Strategic Partnerships and Future Prospects**

The recent approval of the Mocoa Development Plan underscores the local government’s commitment to advancing mineral resource projects. It also supports the implementation of prior agreements, such as the November 2022 Cooperation Framework Agreement between Libero Copper & Gold and the Montclar community. This alignment of government, community, and corporate interests positions the Mocoa project for significant contributions to Colombia’s economy and the global transition to renewable energy.



Libero Copper & Gold’s dedication to responsible exploration and the strong backing from both local communities and political leaders pave the way for the sustainable development of one of Colombia’s most promising mineral resources.

# Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come…

Drumroll, please! Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just dropped the mic at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, announcing the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. Yup, the big pivot is here. After two years of cranking up rates to tame inflation, Powell is officially ready to start loosening the purse strings.

# Breaking Down the Big Shift

In what has to be the least surprising surprise of the year, Powell confirmed that rate cuts are coming soon, saying, “The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Translation? The Fed is done playing the inflation-fighting game and is now turning its attention to preventing a meltdown in the job market.

And Wall Street heard him loud and clear. Stocks jumped, with the Dow climbing over 400 points and the Nasdaq up by about 1.5%. Investors are stoked, Treasury yields are dipping, and everyone’s feeling a little lighter—except maybe those holding cash.

# So, What’s the Game Plan?

With inflation cooling off and the job market starting to look like a sad trombone, Powell’s got his eye on rate cuts. The big question now is: How much and how fast? The next Fed meeting in mid-September is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. Will they go for a cautious quarter-point cut, or do they swing for the fences with a half-point slash?

As always, it’s all about the data. Powell didn’t spill all the beans, but he made it clear the Fed will be watching the numbers closely. A few more weak jobs reports, and we could see some serious rate-cutting action.

# What Does It Mean for You?

Well, if you’ve been sweating those sky-high interest rates on your mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, there might be some relief on the horizon. But don’t pop the champagne just yet—Powell’s not exactly rushing to the finish line here. Rate cuts will likely be gradual, and the Fed’s going to take it slow and steady to avoid rocking the boat too much.

So, keep an eye on those economic reports, stay tuned for the next Fed move, and maybe start planning what you’ll do with those extra dollars in your pocket. A new plant for the office? That fancy coffee machine? The possibilities are endless, but the rate cuts? Not so much. Let’s see how this one plays out!

# Polaris Dawn Mission Faces Brief Delay Before Historic Spacewalk

The Polaris Dawn mission, which is set to make history as the first space mission featuring a spacewalk conducted entirely by non-government astronauts, has been delayed by 24 hours. Originally slated for launch early Monday, the mission is now scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday at the earliest, according to SpaceX. This minor setback is all part of ensuring everything is perfect before this groundbreaking flight.

# What's the Plan?

Once it gets the green light, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will carry the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew aboard the Dragon spacecraft to an altitude of 870 miles above Earth. This marks the highest any human has flown since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. The team will then descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth, where they will spend five days conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies, including a laser-based satellite communication system using SpaceX’s Starlink.

But the highlight of the mission will undoubtedly be the spacewalk, set to be the first-ever performed by private citizens. This ambitious feat will require the entire Dragon spacecraft to be depressurized, a risky maneuver given that the craft lacks an airlock. As a result, all four crew members, led by billionaire entrepreneur and mission commander Jared Isaacman, will don SpaceX’s new EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suits and be tethered for safety as they venture into the vacuum of space.

# A Mission for the Books

This mission isn’t just about making history for the sake of it. The Polaris Dawn crew, which includes Isaacman, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Scott “Kidd” Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, aims to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight and gather valuable data for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The team will navigate through the Van Allen radiation belts—regions of intense radiation that pose significant challenges for deep space exploration—while testing the limits of their new spacesuits.

Despite the slight delay, anticipation remains high for what could be one of the most significant milestones in the burgeoning era of commercial space exploration. As Isaacman and his crew prepare to take civilian space travel to new heights, the world will be watching closely, eager to see this next chapter in human spaceflight unfold.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week’s economic calendar might kick off with some lightweights, but the real action comes on Friday. Monday brings us durable goods orders, Tuesday features the consumer confidence index, and Thursday rounds out the preliminaries with the advance goods trade balance.

Then, it's showtime: Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report takes the stage. This is the last PCE reading before the Fed’s September meeting, where they’re expected to cut rates. How much they cut—25 or 50 basis points—could hinge on what this report has to say.

Earnings are slowing down, but there’s still some excitement in store. Wednesday is the main event, headlined by none other than Nvidia ($NVDA).

# Earnings:

Here’s the lineup for next week, ranked by market cap:

**Tuesday:** Bank of Montreal ($BMO), PVH ($PVH), Nordstrom ($JWN), and Box ($BOX).

**Wednesday: Nvidia** ($NVDA), **Salesforce** ($CRM), **CrowdStrike** ($CRWD), **HP** ($HPQ), Bath & Body Works ($BBWI), J.M. Smucker Company ($SJM), and Chewy ($CHWY).

2868,Wall Street's gone from gloom to boom in the blink of an eye.,"Just two weeks ago, a weak jobs report sent stocks plummeting. Now … Those losses are ancient history. And the markets on a hair trigger, reacting violently to every scrap of data. Vol can be fun. Traders are scaling back bets on aggressive Fed rate cuts. Bond yields are a mixed bag. Short-term up, long-term down.

Banks participated, but not as much as the rest of the world. And going into an election cycle that’s 80 days away from resolution, buckle up for more turbulence ahead. Banks are following the cyclical tides for now.

**NYCB Won Harder Than Any Other Bank This Week.**

New York Community Bancorp shares surged after exchanging preferred stock for common stock with Liberty 77 Capital, Hudson Bay Capital, and Reverence Capital Partners. Part of a 1.05 billion capital raise, the move converts Series B preferred shares to common stock, ensuring no investor exceeds 9.99% ownership post-exchange. This is one of the most levered risk rewards out there in big bank land. If you believe that rates down is net good for CRE & will benefit high L/D ratio banks, this may be for you. Plus, you get to ride along Mnuchin & Trump. It’s not for me right now (Ockham’s Razor), but it is a fun one.

Keybank did win this week. And haters will correctly point out that even though they’re just an average performer over the longer term, they did at least “do something”.

What did they do? KeyCorp secured a $2.8 billion strategic investment from Scotiabank. This deal, priced at 17.17 per share (around 125% of TBV) for approximately 14.9% ownership.

It has been an eventful weekend to say the least… as some of you know we have been in the process of fostering and finally accepted twins. One of which is sick in the NICU still. On Friday we finally got to take the other twin home which lead to us finding out the night he came to us that he was sick with a virus and ended up in the ER. Saturday my son had his first race on his four wheeler and ended up rolling it and ending up in the ER with a concussion… it has been a busy weekend to say the least!

Looking ahead data/ event wise honestly there really isn’t too much from a stand point of volatility to worry about. GDP on Thursday could certainly move the market though as we approach our first rate cut and FOMC in a few weeks.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/q8jl49vmlukd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=03357098e6057702e1a71045b9a6c66346bd8c9d

One thing that I have been watching on this recovery is the weekly buyers which we officially have had three weeks of stronger BUYERS returning to this market. Overall last week and this week when we had some downside movement the one thing that never changed was the weekly buyers. That is the biggest thing despite some consolidation and at times rejections on the daily keeps me feeling pretty bullish.

At market closed we are only about $3 or 0.53% from making a new ATHs on the market. It seems pretty certain with stronger daily buyers, and this major breakout over 554.7 supply that we will see just that this week.

IF we continue to breakout our target will be the 570 area.

From here it is clear bears are once again not in control until they are back under minimally weekly 8ema support near 547.5.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 554.7  
Demand- 495.03 -> 532.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

Now here on ES this is actually our first week of stronger weekly buyer since the first week of July. So there is a big of a divergence there on SPY and ES… however, we also broke through previous supply of 5614 which now puts us about 72 pts from making a new ATHs on the futures market too… that is about 1.3% from close.

Generally speaking the weekly 8ema support has once again become support for us at 5516 and I would not imagine downside until we are closed back under that. Bulls will begin to target 5800.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5614  
Demand- 5000 -> 5356

 

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/xvjo8ainlukd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b23c6edaa578385bcee14df30f6e285ce31b93

Now as we flip over to QQQ and tech you can begin to see where there are some divergences. For the most part while ES/ SPY both broke through their previous ATH resistance and supplies you can see QQQ remains well below that level. I have said it before and I will say it again the one thing that makes me leery of a rally is when SPY/ ES is leading the rally instead of QQQ/ NQ…

Now with that being said we DO have stronger weekly buyers now and have retaken the weekly 8ema support. Generally this wick makes people think of a rejection and drop but these candles have a tendency to be continuation candles. I wouldn’t be surprised if we backtested 470 area first but in general our target is 496.33 supply.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 496.33  
Demand- 414.4 -> 448.92

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

On NQ if we objectively zoom out from the middle of May until now we have realistically been in about a 2000 point consolidation range… with the latest support test at 18502 coming just three weeks ago… while generally when range support is retested we push back to resistance which would be 20588 area in this case… there is always the possibility of a retest of support once more.

Generally though much like QQQ we are back over 8ema resistance and while we have a doji candle here the thicker body can generally lead to upside.

Bulls will continue to seek out 20588 and bears need to seek out 18502.

We have been watching this same yellow bull channel on SPY for a few days now… with the fact that since we have hit our high of 559.61 on 8/19 we have NOT had stronger buyers makes me start to believe more and more that this is going to lead to some downside here… we did put in another supply today at 562.28 which gives us a real nice double supply/ resistance area at 562.28-564.94.

Now with that being said our demand/ support at 556.16 which just so happens to be our daily 8ema support is holding stronger.

Bulls need a breakout over 564.94 and bears need a breakdown under 556.16.

Now looking at ES here we do not have stronger daily buyers today and we also have a new supply at 5651. Realistically the way I look at ES here is that we are in a range from 5598 to 5651 and while we are clearly uptrending since the beginning of August we do Not have a convincing move here until 5598 or 5651 is broke and held.

All eyes were (For me at least) on big tech today… that weak opening and performance from chips certainly provided tech with the push it needed to move lower… one thing I watched Friday on QQQ/ NQ was the juiciest failed breakout on the s/d that we had… now from here we have a very clear top from 481.27- 482.4. our support realistically is 475.2 which is the daily 8ema support.

If bears can get us under the daily 20/ 50ema support of 467.76 then there is a chance this actually could head back to the 100ema support near 459.35.

Now the biggest thing I want to see here on NQ is the fact that we did not breakout of that 19802 demand… this is a support that is now resistance from 8/20 which gives us a great fake breakout here…

This is a similar range that ES is playing in right now.

Now the VIX until the final hour of the day actually played out perfectly for the failed breakout on both ES and NQ… we had a nice demand that was forming and we also were looking to close decently green. However, like usually the VIX did drop into EOD.

We are at a very interesting spot here where this bull flag could play out, however, there is a chance as we see the weakness in NQ that we could see the start of our next leg down.

We have been watching this same yellow bull channel on SPY for a few days now… with the fact that since we have hit our high of 559.61 on 8/19 we have NOT had stronger buyers makes me start to believe more and more that this is going to lead to some downside here… we did put in another supply today at 562.28 which gives us a real nice double supply/ resistance area at 562.28-564.94.

Now with that being said our demand/ support at 556.16 which just so happens to be our daily 8ema support is holding stronger.

Bulls need a breakout over 564.94 and bears need a breakdown under 556.16.

Now looking at ES here we do not have stronger daily buyers today and we also have a new supply at 5651. Realistically the way I look at ES here is that we are in a range from 5598 to 5651 and while we are clearly uptrending since the beginning of August we do Not have a convincing move here until 5598 or 5651 is broke and held.

All eyes were (For me at least) on big tech today… that weak opening and performance from chips certainly provided tech with the push it needed to move lower… one thing I watched Friday on QQQ/ NQ was the juiciest failed breakout on the s/d that we had… now from here we have a very clear top from 481.27- 482.4. our support realistically is 475.2 which is the daily 8ema support.

If bears can get us under the daily 20/ 50ema support of 467.76 then there is a chance this actually could head back to the 100ema support near 459.35.

President and CEO, Kelly Malcolm, provided an in-depth overview of BOGO's operations, financial status, and future plans, emphasizing the company’s growth potential and strategic objectives.

https://preview.redd.it/qrup1b1a63ld1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f9e21d650d16eaa16ca2238334dd108ee7d9845



The Borealis Mine, situated in the Walker Lane mineral trend in Nevada, is 100% owned and fully equipped for operations. Historically, it produced around half a million ounces of gold at an average grade of 2.02 g/t from eight small pits. 



The mine's location, approximately two hours south of Reno and five hours north of Las Vegas, offers excellent access to infrastructure and a skilled workforce. The site is also well-equipped with significant infrastructure, including a leach pad with ample unused capacity and mobile equipment.



In June 2023, the mine's state-of-the-art ADR facility poured its first gold bars. This well-maintained facility is now set to resume processing ore from the existing stockpile, which contains \~350,000 tons of previously mined material. With an expected recovery rate of about 70%, this processing could lead to significant gold production with minimal additional investment.



BOGO has outlined a two-year plan focused on expanding its resource base, identifying new gold deposits, optimizing metallurgical processes, and resuming small-scale mining operations.



As part of these efforts, BOGO has initiated a 3D Earth model compilation to integrate geophysical and geochemical data, which will guide future exploration activities. The company is particularly interested in areas with previous discoveries and is optimistic about uncovering additional high-grade deposits. Historical drill results, such as 67 meters at 16.1 g/t gold, highlight the substantial exploration potential.



BOGO aims to grow through both the drill bit and potential acquisitions of nearby properties. Supporting these plans is BOGO's $4.5 to $5 million cash position, and additional $3.5 to $4 million in restricted cash. 



Overall, the presentation displays how well-positioned BOGO is for growth with its fully equipped Borealis Mine, strong financial standing, and experienced management team. The company’s focus on expanding its resource base, resuming production, and exploring new opportunities within the Walker Lane trend sets the stage for a promising future.

2889,The Hindenburg report on SMCI has some flaws as it is very assumptive by some seemingly discruntled ex employees - here's a TLDR,"First, here is the report [https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/)

It's long winded but really doesn't have a lot of meat in it for being that long winded. It seems as if because they threw the kitchen sink at you and that somehow means the company is doing something drastically wrong but in reality that's not the case. Thankfully, we have a tool at our disposal to break it all down.

I fed the report to ChatGPT-4o and we broke down the report to it's important bits. I asked it to find the most egregious parts of the article about SMCI and rank them in order of concern based on factors such as plausibility, biases, seriousness, and provability.

All of this chaos is bolstered only by 2 ex employees a sales person and a sales director that are no longer with the company.

**Here is that result:**

* **Continued Improper Revenue Recognition**
   * **Rating: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (10/10)**
   * **Why**: This is the most severe issue, involving potential ongoing fraudulent accounting practices. The report claims that Super Micro restarted improper revenue recognition just three months after settling with the SEC for previous accounting violations. However, the evidence presented primarily relies on the testimonies of two former employees. It's important to note that these individuals are no longer with the company, and there is no clear indication that they have firsthand knowledge of current practices. The article itself acknowledges this limitation, stating that these are accounts from former employees who might not have full visibility into the company's current operations.
* **Customer and Product Quality Issues**
   * **Rating: \*\*\*\*\*\* (6/10)**
   * **Why**: The report highlights significant operational and reputational challenges, including major product quality problems, poor after-sales service, and the loss of key customers like Tesla and CoreWeave. These issues are based on interviews with current and former customers, and if accurate, they could lead to financial losses and damage Super Micro's business relationships. The article cites specific examples, such as a 17.5% malfunction rate reported by GMI Cloud, but it’s important to recognize that the severity of these issues might vary depending on how widespread they are.
* **Undisclosed Related Party Transactions**
   * **Rating: \*\*\*\*\*\* (6/10)**
   * **Why**: The report presents evidence of undisclosed related party transactions involving entities controlled by the CEO's brothers, raising concerns about governance and transparency. These transactions could distort financials if they involve favorable terms that are not market-driven. However, the article also notes that while these relationships are concerning, their impact would depend on the extent of financial manipulation or conflicts of interest involved. The relationships described in the report are mostly based on trade records and interviews, but the extent to which these transactions affect Super Micro’s financials remains unclear.
* **Sanctions and Export Control Violations**
   * **Rating: \*\*\*\*\* (5/10)**
   * **Why**: Allegations that Super Micro’s products continued to be exported to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in violation of U.S. export bans are potentially serious. However, the article notes the difficulty in proving intentional violations, as much of the activity involves third-party resellers or distributors. The complexity of tracking these downstream sales and the lack of direct evidence linking Super Micro to intentional sanctions evasion make this less immediately concerning unless more concrete evidence emerges.
* **Rehiring of Executives Involved in Previous Violations**
   * **Rating: \*\*\*\* (4/10)**
   * **Why**: The rehiring of top executives who were involved in past accounting scandals raises questions about corporate governance and accountability. The report describes this as indicative of a disregard for proper governance practices, but it does not present this issue as an immediate legal or financial threat. Instead, it reflects poorly on the company’s management culture. The article quotes former employees expressing concern over these rehiring decisions, but these are more subjective assessments rather than concrete evidence of ongoing wrongdoing.

Before this analysis I asked what is the seriousness of the report and most pressing concerns.

# 1. Proof of Continued Improper Revenue Recognition:

* **Lawsuit Filed in April 2024**: The report cites a lawsuit filed by a former Super Micro general manager in April 2024, which specifically alleges that Super Micro resumed improper revenue recognition shortly after the SEC settlement. The lawsuit mentions practices such as recognizing incomplete sales, premature revenue booking even when products were faulty or not delivered, and circumventing internal accounting controls.
* **Former Employee Testimonies**: Interviews with former employees corroborate these claims, describing practices such as channel stuffing and partial shipments that artificially inflated revenue figures.
* **Rehiring of Executives Involved in Previous Violations**: The report highlights the rehiring of key executives involved in the earlier accounting scandal, suggesting a continuation of the same problematic practices.

# 2. Proof of Undisclosed Related Party Transactions:

* **Corporate Records and Trade Data**: The report identifies two Taiwanese entities owned by the CEO’s youngest brother that operate out of the same facility as Super Micro and are believed to supply components to Super Micro, despite not being disclosed as related parties.
* **Interviews with Former Employees**: Former employees and media reports confirm that these entities are suppliers to Super Micro, yet no related party transactions with them are disclosed in Super Micro's filings.
* **Circular Relationships with Disclosed Entities**: The report outlines circular transactions with disclosed related parties (Ablecom and Compuware), where components are supplied to these entities and then sold back to Super Micro, raising concerns about financial manipulation. These entities are heavily reliant on Super Micro, with almost all of their exports going to the company, suggesting they function more as extensions of Super Micro rather than independent businesses.

Think what you will by the information summarization and analysis you want but in my opinion this is a bit of a dud of a report. All I see here is a company trying to make money. Which is what they are supposed to be doing.

TLDR: seems like some ex employees (2) have an axe to grind because they are no longer with the company.",1724773353,831165,Xtianus21,t2_58rkqicv,fe219cb08ccd5c422a7dab2fe86ca60aadbcfc4b42ab80ee4ec609148e421ffb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f2k9hn/the_hindenburg_report_on_smci_has_some_flaws_as/
2890,Nvidia's Phenomenal Growth: Is It Sustainable?,"https://preview.redd.it/rfzuj34979ld1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c62fecbf9b7e29071a49dd18d2b42b289cd1c0

Soaring demand for Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) processors has catapulted its market capitalization from $350 billion at the start of 2023 to $1 trillion, then $2 trillion, and finally, $3 trillion this summer. In June, it surpassed Microsoft, an AI-centric software titan and one of Nvidia's largest chip buyers, to become the world's most valuable company. Although Nvidia briefly lost this title—and $900 billion in market value—during a recent stock market panic, it has since regained most of its losses. As the company prepares to announce its latest earnings on August 28th, nearly everyone expects another stellar quarter. “How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?” quipped Mr. Cramer on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidia’s CEO. These days, being bearish on Nvidia is almost unheard of. Or, as Sir David might murmur, “Not a single Ursus nvidiaensis in sight.”

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in Nvidia, another seems eager to increase its holdings. Among the 74 Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company, 66 recommend buying more shares; none suggest selling. Their average one-year price target suggests a market value of approximately $3.5 trillion. James Anderson, a seasoned tech investor and early Nvidia backer, has hinted that the company could be worth $49 trillion in a decade—slightly more than the current total value of the S&P 500 index. Achieving this would require consistent annual sales growth of 60% at current operating margins of around 60%, coupled with plausible assumptions about cash flow. (Mr. Anderson’s current firm, Lingotto, is owned by Exor, the largest shareholder of The Economist's parent company.)

Investment banks like Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, and UBS forecast that Nvidia’s annual revenues will more than double this year, surpassing $100 billion, grow by as much as 50% in 2025, and continue expanding by double digits until at least 2027. By then, its operating profit could exceed $150 billion—roughly one-third more than Apple, the tech industry’s most successful money-maker, achieved last year. The sheer scale and speed of these figures should give investors pause. As they catch their breath, they might consider two potential contradictions that could undermine Nvidia’s long-term growth.

**Contradiction One: Dependence on TSMC**

The first issue relates to Nvidia’s primary supplier. Nvidia designs its chips but relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for production. As demand for AI servers has surged, Nvidia has gone from being one of TSMC’s many clients to likely becoming its second-largest, trailing only Apple. If Nvidia is indeed ""customer B""—one of two clients contributing at least 10% of TSMC’s revenue and disclosed in regulatory filings—it spent $7.7 billion with TSMC last year, up from $5.5 billion two years earlier. Given that most of Nvidia’s $19 billion in purchase commitments for 2025 will likely go to TSMC, it could soon overtake the current ""customer A,"" which spent just under $18 billion with the Taiwanese firm in 2023.

Despite their growing interdependence, Nvidia and TSMC’s product cycles are diverging. Earlier this year, Mr. Huang committed to releasing a new AI chip annually, instead of every couple of years. TSMC, in response, is racing to expand capacity, planning to invest up to $32 billion this year and potentially more in 2025. However, it takes at least 18 months to build a new factory, each of which can cost $20 billion. Planning discussions with clients typically start a year or two in advance. How Nvidia’s accelerated timeline aligns with TSMC’s more deliberate pace remains unclear. An early sign of discord: Nvidia has postponed shipments of its latest chips, called Blackwell, by a few months due to technical issues.

**Contradiction Two: Pricing and Competition**

Nvidia’s reliance on TSMC underscores a second tension in the bullish case. Because TSMC controls production volume and efficiency, Nvidia can only meet lofty investor expectations by raising prices. The new Blackwell chip is expected to cost 20-25% more than its predecessor, which was itself double the price of the previous generation. While each chip is more powerful than the last, the cost per unit of computing power isn’t dropping fast enough for customers.

In August, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, whose cloud computing division is a major Nvidia customer, noted that clients have “loudly expressed a desire for better price performance.” Amazon is now investing in its own chip designs, as are Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla. AMD, a competing chip designer, has gone from virtually no AI chip sales in 2022 to a projected $5 billion this year. On August 19th, AMD announced it would acquire server maker ZT Systems, positioning it to better compete with Nvidia’s end-to-end solutions. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants like Huawei, which are barred from purchasing top-tier Nvidia products due to U.S. sanctions, may develop alternatives that could threaten Nvidia’s market share—much as companies like BYD have challenged Tesla in the electric vehicle market.

Assuming a killer application eventually emerges—though none has yet—generative AI is unlikely to achieve widespread adoption unless costs fall significantly. For instance, answering a ChatGPT query can cost seven times more than a Google search. Nvidia may soon face a dilemma: reduce prices to sustain growth or maintain them to protect profit margins. For now, Nvidia bulls believe they can have it both ways. But the scent of irrational exuberance may become too potent to ignore.",1724784996,831177,worten777,t2_6xnuiwj6,80bc2116a3a84501919421e857d9eae71f629e2fd20ead44f097c68d11dbb50c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f2p2wt/nvidias_phenomenal_growth_is_it_sustainable/

# Nvidia Earnings — The Moment of Truth

Get your popcorn ready, folks. Nvidia ($NVDA) is about to take center stage with its latest earnings report, and Wall Street is buzzing like it's the season finale of your favorite show.

# What’s on the Menu?

Nvidia's chips are the golden ticket for training AI systems, so expectations are high—really high. Analysts are predicting the company will report a whopping $28.84 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter, more than doubling last year’s number. For those keeping score at home, Nvidia’s stock has already skyrocketed 159% this year, and the stakes are only getting higher.

The real question isn’t about what Nvidia will say about last quarter—it’s about what they’ll promise for the next one. Investors want to see revenue guidance between $33 and $34 billion, and they’re especially interested in any gossip about the new Blackwell chips. 

# Bumps in the Road?

But it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Nvidia. Concerns about delays in rolling out those next-gen Blackwell chips have investors a little jittery. Earlier reports of manufacturing hiccups set off alarm bells, but some analysts, like Morgan Stanley’s team, think this might be much ado about nothing. They’re banking on strong demand to keep the hype train on track, even if Nvidia’s new toys aren’t ready to ship until next year.

# The Bigger Picture

Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, but it's also faced some turbulence. The stock tumbled over 25% during July and August as tech stocks took a hit from broader market rotations. Concerns about overspending on AI and potential delays with the Blackwell chips only added fuel to the fire.

Yet, Nvidia has a knack for bouncing back. The stock recovered from those earlier stumbles, and with its earnings report just around the corner, the market is bracing for a potential 10% swing in either direction.

Will Nvidia deliver another mic-drop moment? Or will it leave investors wanting more? We shall find out very soon…

# Zuckerberg vs. The White House

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta ($META), just dropped a bombshell, claiming that the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor Covid-19 content on Facebook and Instagram. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleged that senior officials from the White House repeatedly pushed Meta to remove certain Covid-19 posts, including humor and satire, and expressed frustration when the platform didn’t comply.

# Meta’s Regrets and the White House's Response

Zuckerberg said that while it was ultimately Meta’s decision to take down content, he believes the government’s pressure was inappropriate. He expressed regret over not being more outspoken about it at the time and acknowledged that Meta made some decisions during the pandemic that, with the benefit of hindsight, it might not make again. “We should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration,” Zuckerberg said, vowing to push back if faced with similar demands in the future.

The White House responded to Zuckerberg’s claims by defending its actions, stating that during the pandemic, the administration encouraged responsible measures to protect public health and safety but didn't directly enforce censorship. “Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies should make independent choices about the information they present,” a spokesperson said.

# The Ongoing Debate Over Free Speech and Content Moderation

This latest revelation underscores the ongoing debate about the role social media companies should play in moderating content. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan, has accused big tech firms of colluding with the government to censor speech. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is taking a more neutral stance moving forward, noting that he doesn’t plan to make political contributions in the upcoming U.S. presidential election to avoid appearing biased.

The saga continues as Meta and the government navigate the tricky waters of content moderation, free speech, and the responsibilities of tech giants. It’s a reminder that in the digital age, the lines between public health, free expression, and political pressure are as blurred as ever.

  


# Super Micro Gets Hit With Hindenburg Report

Super Micro Computer Inc. ($SMCI) is facing some serious heat after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company and dropped a bombshell report accusing the AI server maker of some sketchy financial practices. According to Hindenburg, their deep dive uncovered ""glaring accounting red flags,"" undisclosed related party transactions, and failures around export controls. Naturally, the market freaked out—shares of Super Micro plummeted as much as 8.7% before clawing back some losses to close down 2.6%. Not exactly the kind of day you want to have.

But if you were hoping for a response from Super Micro, don’t hold your breath. The company has chosen to stay mum on the whole ordeal, calling it all “rumors and speculation.” Hindenburg, meanwhile, is no stranger to shaking things up. They’ve taken down big names before, like Carl Icahn’s empire and India’s Adani Group. So, when they set their sights on Super Micro, investors understandably got the jitters.

# Riding the AI Wave…for Now

Super Micro has been surfing the AI wave like a pro, becoming a major player in the server market with its high-powered gear and cozy relationship with Nvidia ($NVDA). Business has been booming—revenue more than doubled to $14.9 billion in the last fiscal year thanks to a surge in demand for AI servers. But Hindenburg’s report casts a shadow over that success, hinting that beneath the surface, there might be some not-so-savory practices that could trip up Super Micro as competition heats up.

And it’s not just Hindenburg throwing shade. Analysts have been whispering about the company’s hefty spending to support the next gen of AI chips and its slimmer profit margins on those high-cost servers. There’s also growing concern that the big tech companies might start tightening their belts on AI spending if they don’t see the dollars rolling in soon. For now, Super Micro’s got some serious explaining to do if it wants to keep riding high in the AI game.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Forget the rest—there's only one name on everyone's lips this earnings season: Nvidia. The AI chip giant has the entire market holding its breath. Why the hype? With its dominance in the tech world, Nvidia isn't just another player; it’s a heavyweight champ. It’s no surprise that Nvidia alone makes up over 6% of the S&P 500’s market cap. In a market brimming with contenders, all eyes are glued to this one star.

**Wednesday: Nvidia** ($NVDA), **Salesforce** ($CRM), **CrowdStrike** ($CRWD), **HP**($HPQ), Bath & Body Works ($BBWI), J.M. Smucker Company ($SJM), and Chewy ($CHWY).

Get ready for the main event—Nvidia:

* ($NVDA) is about to unveil its earnings, and all eyes are on the numbers. The tech giant is expected to report a whopping $28.84 billion in revenue, more than doubling last year's figure. Data center revenue is projected to hit $22.6 billion, showing just how hot the demand is for Nvidia's AI chips. Net income? That's forecasted to soar to $14.95 billion, again more than doubling year-over-year. But there might be a plot twist: whispers of delays with their new Blackwell AI platform could throw a curveball. With the potential for a big market reaction, this is one reveal you won't want to miss.",1724799447,831188,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,5182453bea38293916a2fbfeea276e39644303fc9816db8bff69ef8bf16cde2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f2uubm/stock_market_recap_08272024_nvidia_earnings_the/

(Ticker: NEXG.v or NXGCF for US investors) is a gold-focused exploration company with a portfolio of Canadian assets, including its flagship Goliath Gold Complex in Northwestern Ontario. 

https://preview.redd.it/w7ka6rhhjald1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=16a6f790052e545f82ec51ace640277bd606afc3



The complex encompasses the Goliath, Goldlund, and Miller deposits, which benefit from excellent access to infrastructure such as the Trans-Canada Highway, power, and rail.



Last week, NexGold announced significant findings from its spring field program and the initiation of an expanded exploration campaign at the Goliath Complex.



The spring program, which began in May 2024, included prospecting, mapping, channel sampling, and soil geochemistry sampling across key areas within the complex, particularly focusing on the Fold Nose, South Syncline, and Far East targets on the Goliath claim block, as well as Interlakes, Wild Cats, Goldlund South, and Cabin Bay targets on the Goldlund claim block.



The exploration yielded promising results, especially at the Fold Nose area, where channel samples confirmed significant gold mineralization. Highlights from the sampling include:

* 7.13 g/t Au over 2.00m, including 15.70 g/t Au over 0.75m
* 3.18 g/t Au over 2.68m, including 7.53 g/t Au over 0.78m
* 5.10 g/t Au over 0.52m
* 5.09 g/t Au over 0.47m



These findings suggest the presence of a more extensive mineralization system, further supporting the potential for future discoveries as part of NexGold's ongoing 25,000-meter drill program.



Additionally, NexGold has expanded its exploration initiative targeting the northeast sector of the Goldlund claim block, an area that has seen limited exploration. This new phase includes deploying a larger prospecting team and establishing new soil geochemistry sampling grids over the strike extension of the Miller Deposit and other targets like Cabin Bay and Miles.



This comprehensive exploration effort is part of NexGold's multi-stage program to advance its projects, enhance geological understanding, and identify new drilling targets to drive growth at the Goliath Gold Complex.

2900,Investors Flock to US Government Bond ETFs Amid Fed Rate Cut Anticipation,"https://preview.redd.it/sqg8ezgvudld1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=77182682230a0699ab28c6f661dc10ee9d0a0b98

August witnessed a surge of inflows into US government bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighting a resurgence in fixed income investments as the US economy shows signs of cooling. The anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September has driven investors to allocate substantial capital into these funds.

According to Morningstar data, BlackRock’s TLT, the largest ETF tracking long-dated Treasury bonds, attracted nearly $4 billion in inflows from the beginning of August through Monday. This influx is among the highest in the fund's history, surpassed only in three months since its inception in 2002.

These inflows signal a significant recovery for bonds, following two years of subpar or negative returns and considerable outflows from fixed income in 2022. With the US economy slowing down, investors are gravitating towards the relative safety of fixed income assets amid the volatile performance of US equities. Bond yields, which inversely correlate with prices, have declined this year as expectations build for the Fed to reduce interest rates from their current 23-year high.

The rising demand for ETFs indicates that the appeal of bonds is extending beyond traditional big money managers and hedge funds to include both retail and institutional investors. Market participants are eager to lock in current yields before they potentially decline further. BlackRock’s TLT has emerged as the preferred choice, leading inflows across its range of Treasury bond ETFs this year.

https://preview.redd.it/340wq5iwudld1.png?width=2148&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de1639c91e49b171a85cd973599537f750262f7

TLT is particularly attractive because it tracks Treasury bonds with maturities of 20 to 30 years, which are traditionally viewed as safe-haven investments during periods of market instability. Despite being the third-largest taxable bond ETF, trailing Vanguard’s BND and BlackRock’s AGG, TLT has amassed more inflows in August than both of these larger rivals combined.

In addition to these three major funds, investors have poured $12.2 billion into US sovereign bond ETFs in August alone, setting a pace that could surpass July, which recorded the highest inflows since October, according to EPFR data.

Overall, taxable bond funds and ETFs have attracted more than $280 billion between January and July of this year, already surpassing the total inflows for 2023, which stood at $225 billion. This is a stark contrast to the $204 billion in outflows that these funds experienced in 2022.

Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week, indicated that the ""time has come"" for rate cuts. Futures market traders are currently pricing in over a full percentage point of rate cuts before year-end, suggesting two quarter-point cuts and one substantial half-point reduction during the remaining Federal Open Market Committee meetings in 2024.

The momentum of inflows into US bond funds is expected to persist. Money market funds, which predominantly invest in ultra-safe, highly liquid government securities, have reached a new record, holding over $6 trillion in assets as of the week ending August 21, according to data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI).

A significant portion of this capital is anticipated to shift into longer-dated government bonds once the Fed initiates rate cuts, as yields on short-term bonds are likely to fall below those on longer-term debt. For now, many investors remain in money market funds, waiting for a more substantial rate cut—beyond just 0.25 percentage points—before extending their investments further along the yield curve.",1724841372,831186,worten777,t2_6xnuiwj6,47938d086b6847af6a758ee2a7392b26b84a7919b253c9b669a8503749b204c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f36v4c/investors_flock_to_us_government_bond_etfs_amid/

2912,EMP Metals (EMPS.c) Advances Lithium Exploration with Successful Vertical Well Completion and Groundbreaking Horizontal Drilling at Viewfield Project,"Yesterday, EMP Metals Corp. (Ticker: EMPS.c or EMPPF for US investors), a Canadian-based lithium exploration and development company focused on large-scale resources using direct lithium extraction (DLE), has announced significant progress in its summer drilling program at the Viewfield project in Saskatchewan. 

https://preview.redd.it/n4nk78f7mhld1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d1e338b9bb940f9236630c1610c2ace0251b89d



EMPS has successfully completed its first vertical test well, designed to confirm lithium concentrations and define reservoir characteristics in the northern part of the Viewfield area. This achievement marks a crucial step in EMP Metals' efforts to expand its resource base in the region.



The vertical well produced approximately 72 meters of core, essential for analyzing formation permeability and porosity. Brine sampling from multiple isolated zones within the Duperow formation is currently underway, and core samples have been sent to a laboratory in Calgary for detailed analysis, with full results expected within two months.



The data obtained from the core samples and brine analysis will play a vital role in supporting the company’s geological model and correlating results across its substantial land base, which includes 196,000 net acres of Subsurface Dispositions and strategic wellbores in Southern Saskatchewan.



In addition to the vertical well, EMP Metals has initiated drilling on a horizontal well targeting the project's Duperow formation. This well represents a pioneering effort in lithium brine extraction, as it is believed to be the first horizontal well drilled for this purpose in Saskatchewan and potentially the first in North America or globally. 



The horizontal well is designed with two parallel one-mile horizontal legs within a high-concentration zone, aiming for an initial flow rate of approximately 1,000 cubic meters per day from a single zone. The design also allows for extended flow testing and pressure monitoring.



Paul Schubach, COO of EMP Metals, expressed excitement about the potential of horizontal drilling techniques for lithium brine extraction, noting that this method could significantly optimize lithium recovery, control concentration, and increase flow rates compared to vertical wells.



The company anticipates completing the drilling of the horizontal well within the next seven days, with site preparation for flow testing to follow. Initial results from the vertical well brine sampling are expected in the coming weeks, with further updates to be provided as additional data becomes available.

# Buffett's Berkshire Joins the Trillion-Dollar Club 

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just hit a whopping $1 trillion market cap, becoming the first non-tech U.S. company to join the exclusive trillion-dollar club. Take that, Silicon Valley!

Berkshire's stock has been on a roll this year, climbing 30% in 2024 and outpacing the S&P 500's 17% gain. The company's strong performance has been fueled by robust insurance results, economic optimism, and the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

# Old-School Cool with a Modern Twist 

Unlike its techy trillion-dollar club companions—think Apple ($AAPL), Microsoft, and Nvidia—Berkshire's success is built on what some might call ""old-school"" businesses. We're talking railways, insurance, and Dairy Queen blizzards, not cloud computing or AI chips.

Buffett, who took over a floundering textile company in the 1960s and transformed it into this sprawling conglomerate, has proven that slow and steady does indeed win the race. Even with a significant chunk of Berkshire's portfolio invested in Apple, the firm's focus on value over flashy growth has paid off big time.

# Cash Moves and Strategic Shifts 

Recently, Buffett has been in what some might call ""defensive mode."" He's been trimming Berkshire's holdings in some heavyweights like Apple and Bank of America, building up a record cash pile of about $277 billion. This cautious approach has some investors speculating whether the Oracle of Omaha is seeing storm clouds on the economic horizon.

Buffett might be getting ready for more acquisition opportunities or simply reinforcing Berkshire's reputation as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty. Whatever the case, his strategy appears to be working—investors are rewarding Berkshire's steady hand with a spot in the trillion-dollar club.

# What’s Next? 

Looking ahead, Berkshire's all-weather portfolio seems well-positioned for whatever the future holds. The company might not boast eye-popping growth, but it's hard to argue with a steady performer in a world of market volatility.

As Greg Abel prepares to step into Buffett's legendary shoes, only time will tell if Berkshire can continue its winning streak. But for now, the Oracle of Omaha's empire is basking in the glow of a trillion-dollar valuation—a testament to the power of patience, prudence, and, of course, a good old-fashioned blizzard from Dairy Queen.

# Nvidia: Not Quite Perfect

# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $0.68 adjusted vs. $0.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $30 billion vs. $28.9 billion expected
* **Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $32.5 billion vs. $31.9 billion expected (but fell short of high estimates up to $37.9 billion)
* **Stock Movement:** Down -5.87% in extended trading

Nvidia ($NVDA) just dropped their latest earnings report, and while it wasn't a total disaster, it also didn't have us popping champagne. The chipmaker forecasted third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, which is technically higher than the average analyst estimate of $31.9 billion. But here's the catch: some pie-in-the-sky expectations were up to $37.9 billion. As a result, Nvidia's stock took a 5% dip in late trading, adding a reality check to its gravity-defying run this year.

* **Chip Slip:** The culprit behind this lukewarm reception? Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. The company admitted to hitting some production snags, which means they’re tinkering with manufacturing processes to boost yields (think: more functioning chips per batch). While CEO Jensen Huang reassured everyone that the ""anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,"" the market isn't big on anticipation—it’s all about execution.
* **Data Center Dominance:** Nvidia has been riding the AI boom like a pro surfer catching a killer wave. With nearly 88% of its revenue coming from data center chips, Nvidia is the go-to for AI accelerators. Last quarter, they pulled in $26.3 billion from their data-center division alone, handily beating the $25.1 billion estimate. Their gaming segment isn’t too shabby either, with $2.9 billion in sales. But let’s face it, all eyes are on their AI chips powering the likes of ChatGPT.
* **Competition Heating Up:** Nvidia’s success hasn't gone unnoticed. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are scrambling to grab a slice of the AI pie, even if their combined revenues only account for about 5% of Nvidia’s total. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues to expand its lead, having shipped samples of its Blackwell chips despite the production hiccups.
* **AI Boom or Bust? :** With a market cap north of $3 trillion, Nvidia has been the belle of the AI ball. Yet, the soaring spending on AI infrastructure has some wondering if we're heading towards a bubble. Nvidia remains optimistic, projecting that the demand for its AI chips will continue to skyrocket. Investors, on the other hand, might be looking for more than just optimism after the stock’s recent rollercoaster ride.

For now, it looks like Nvidia is still in the driver's seat of the AI revolution. But with production challenges and rising competition, they'll need to keep their foot on the gas.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

At 8:30 AM ET, the initial jobless claims report will provide fresh insight into the labor market, especially in light of Jerome Powell hinting at a possible rate cut in September during his Jackson Hole speech. Powell noted that while the labor market isn’t in a crisis, it’s showing signs of softening.

We’ll also see updated numbers for second-quarter GDP at the same time. Last month’s preliminary figures showed the economy grew by 2.8% in Q2, beating expectations.

2915,Understanding Risk-Reward Ratios and the Math Behind Consecutive Losing Trades,"
When trading with a favorable risk-reward ratio, such as 1:3 or 1:4, the idea is that your winning trades will compensate for multiple losing trades. Let’s break down the math to see how many losing trades you can afford in a row before you wipe out your profits.



**1. Risk-Reward Ratio of 1:3**



	•	**Scenario:** You risk $100 to make $300.

	•	**Winning Trade:** If you win, you make $300.

	•	**Losing Trade:** If you lose, you lose $100.



**Break-even Point After Multiple Losing Trades:**



	•	After one winning trade, you are up $300.

	•	If you then lose the next three trades:

	•	3 losing trades = $100 \* 3 = $300 lost.

	•	Net result: $300 (profit) - $300 (losses) = $0 (break-even).



**Break-even with more details:**



	•	With a 1:3 risk-reward ratio, one win covers three losses.

	•	You can lose up to **three consecutive trades** after each winning trade and still be at break-even.



**Extended Losing Streak Analysis:**



	•	**First winning trade:** You make $300.

	•	**Next 4 consecutive losses:** You lose $400 (4 losses x $100 each).

	•	Net result: $300 (profit from win) - $400 (losses) = **-$100 (net loss)**.



Thus, after a win, you can afford **up to three consecutive losses** before you begin losing your initial capital.



**2. Risk-Reward Ratio of 1:4**



	•	**Scenario:** You risk $100 to make $400.

	•	**Winning Trade:** If you win, you make $400.

	•	**Losing Trade:** If you lose, you lose $100.



**Break-even Point After Multiple Losing Trades:**



	•	After one winning trade, you are up $400.

	•	If you then lose the next four trades:

	•	4 losing trades = $100 \* 4 = $400 lost.

	•	Net result: $400 (profit) - $400 (losses) = $0 (break-even).



**Break-even with more details:**



	•	With a 1:4 risk-reward ratio, one win covers four losses.

	•	You can lose up to **four consecutive trades** after each winning trade and still be at break-even.



**Extended Losing Streak Analysis:**



	•	**First winning trade:** You make $400.

	•	**Next 5 consecutive losses:** You lose $500 (5 losses x $100 each).

	•	Net result: $400 (profit from win) - $500 (losses) = **-$100 (net loss)**.



Thus, after a win, you can afford **up to four consecutive losses** before you start losing your initial capital.



**Key Takeaways**



	1.	**Risk-Reward 1:3**:

	•	One win ($300 profit) covers up to three losses ($300 total loss).

	•	You can lose **three consecutive trades** after a win before starting to lose your initial capital.

	2.	**Risk-Reward 1:4**:

	•	One win ($400 profit) covers up to four losses ($400 total loss).

	•	You can lose **four consecutive trades** after a win before starting to lose your initial capital.



**Why This Matters**



These risk-reward ratios are powerful because they allow you to maintain profitability even with a relatively low win rate. For instance:



	•	With a 1:3 ratio, you can be profitable with a win rate as low as 25%.

	•	With a 1:4 ratio, your win rate can be as low as 20%, and you’d still be profitable.



By understanding these dynamics, you can manage your trades more effectively and remain confident in your strategy, knowing that a few losses won’t necessarily derail your overall profitability.

2918,US uranium stocks ,"Full disclosure: I work for a newly listed US uranium company (CSE HRK), microcap company that just acquired assets in Colorado. 

My question is, what is the general consensus view on nuclear/trade on the uranium trade?  Our bet is that nuclear is the picks and shovels to chips on the same logic that chips is the picks and shovels trade to AI

Does the average generalist investor care about uranium, for example that it is a severely under supplied market, and the uranium fundamentals are just about as strong as they've ever been -  or is it too old school and put into the ""dirty mining"" camp.

[Studies show that LLMs perform financial analysis better than actual financial analysts.](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BFI_WP_2024-65.pdf) For fun, I wanted to see what Claude and GPT thought of NVIDIA's earnings.

Here's the information I fed into the models:

* Balance Sheets
* Earnings
* Cash Flow statements
* Ratios (P/E ratio, P/S ratio, etc)

(Note, this information is fetched in the backend and injected into the prompt).

Both Claude and GPT independently rated NVIDIA's earnings a 5/5 despite its high P/E and P/S ratio!

**Claude's Summary**

Pros:

1. Exceptional revenue growth and profitability
2. Strong cash flow generation
3. Robust balance sheet with high cash reserves
4. High efficiency in converting sales to profits
5. Strong return on equity and assets

Cons:

1. High market valuation might lead to increased volatility
2. Potential for increased competition in the AI chip market
3. Cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry

Recommendation and Rating: 5/5

**OpenAI's Summary**

**Pros:**

* Strong profitability with high margins and return on equity.
* Excellent liquidity position with a high current ratio.
* Strong cash flow generation, exceeding net income.
* High Piotroski F-Score indicating robust financial health.

**Cons:**

* Negative change in working capital, which could impact liquidity if not managed properly.

# Recommendation

Based on the financial data, NVIDIA appears to be in excellent financial health with strong profitability, liquidity, and cash flow metrics. The high Piotroski F-Score further supports this positive outlook. However, potential investors should keep an eye on the change in working capital.

**Rating: 5/5**

I believe that AI will make financial analysis **wayyy** easier for retail investors who are just learning how to analyze a business. What do you guys think? Would you trust AI for to analyze stocks?

2925,"Markets are Volatile Post- NVDA Earnings… 8-29-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","For those of you who read these from reddit I am sorry for not posting last night… reddit was down for me when it was time to post last night so I ended up not being able to post.

We got the long awaited NVDA earnings… my thoughts were a good green NVDA would likely take the markets to ATHs… however, I didn’t expect the volatility we had today… I am kinda of surprised but I also think it tells a bigger story…

We have been consolidating on ES for almost 2 weeks now and overall that lower range support was broken and more importantly the upper range/ resistance was rejected once again… NQ (tech) continues to reject and continues to close lower highs and touch lower lows… all of this points to a market that is not the bullish market it once was.

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/o7lct763wnld1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bda433ee8cac5055a4759d4916b5cbda6d94fed9

I mentioned that we were approaching a major failed breakout here on SPY… that failed breakout led to once again another retest of 562.28- 564.94 double supply area. For now 9 trading days SPY has closed inside of the 556.16 to 562.28 level… once again we need bulls to close over 562.28 or bears to close under 556.16…

The hard part here is that we do NOT have stronger buyers to breakout (which is why we got hard rejected today) and we do not have sellers yet to take us lower (which is why we cant break support).

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 550.95 -> 562.28 -> 564.94  
Demand- 556.16

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/58mqgoi3wnld1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=77c2006aff25718e6b5d202bf6499b279ed69eed

On ES we also failed to bring in stronger daily buyers today… not only that we had a major support test off the daily 20ema support and a major resistance test off the daily supply/ resistance of 5651. What I find interesting here is the fact that despite closing (After NVDA moved us after hours) Es did technically break its range support while SPY did not…

Right now I think we are setting up for a decently red day tomorrow… we have a nice failed recovery here on the s/d and a nice price action failed recovery to match… generally I expect a big double top here and I would generally look for a retest of 5556. If bears can close under that we are likely headed to 5500 or lower next week. In the off chance bulls hold support again I would need to see 5651 closed over before I turned full bull ATHs again.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5651 -> 5716  
Demand- 5598

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/77nyx7s3wnld1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43205cbd8607fef7f6f8c327e68e96a0e001d64

Now on QQQ we finally closed out stronger daily sellers for back to back days. Now granted those sellers are not very impressive it is certainly notable. Here on QQQ you can see that since 8/20/24 we have been making lower lows and lower highs… a nice bear channel has formed. Generally it COULD be a weirdly long bull flag and we COULD still see ATHs… but with now 3 back to back to back failed s/d recoveries here things are certainly starting to look gloomy for the bulls.

Generally if bears can close under daily 50ema support of 468.43 tomorrow then I would look for 455-460 next week. Bulls must defend this 20/ 50 ema support and eventually retake 481.27- 482.4 to look for ATHs.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 481.27 -> 482.4  
Demand- 434.8

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/gjqkca24wnld1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=57996e36dd1d2f377b228d7d153bec78c9bf98d4

Much like QQQ here on NQ we finally had back to back sellers on the daily… however, the daily sellers did slightly weaken today… also uniquely to NQ we did get a new demand/ support at 19306… this actually gives us a really nice visual of the range we are in right here…

We had a demand/ support area around 19600 that we did defend for a long time. we are getting a nice yellow bear channel here. Yesterday the bears closed us back under daily 5, 20 and 50ema support for the first time in almost 3 weeks. However, the bulls did get a nice daily double bottom that closed us just barely over 20/ 50ema resistance. If you look at the trend for the last 9 days now every other day has been a clear reversal… if that trend plays out then we could look for a move down to the 19000 area tomorrow.

Bears next target is a closure under 100ema support of 19000. IF we can close under that then we will look for a bigger breakdown.

Bulls must breakout over minimally 19639 at closure to break the lower high closures.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 19922 -> 19986  
Demand- 19306 -> 19803

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/swbygyx4wnld1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c8fd31a06be6941ad32b07b82e6a43e5787a273

The VIX continues to just chop in a range much like ES does… one thing that I found interesting today was the fact that we had such a major rejection on ES/ NQ into EOD but the VIX really did not see the same push higher and more importantly didn’t hold that push.

I am watching the fact that we did put in a new supply/ resistance at 17.12 today and we did reject off that level. However, we also came down and bounce off 15.43 demand and support. I can see a case here for this also turning into a double bottom that pushes us back to 17.12 area… if that does play out then likely the bigger red day on the markets I am looking at will play out.

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

https://preview.redd.it/liruoub5wnld1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=0877634b8d4cf5b34a610b761d4d6905de3eaf26

Since a lot of reddit users like to say the only time I don’t post on reddit is when I have a bad day… I included yesterdays log because I did not have a bad day… actually had a great day but just couldn’t get a post out…

I also had a great day of trading today. I still am taking a loss on my first play of the day as I am tending to catch the wrong move or a big wick first… but overall this week might be one of the best weeks I have had in a very long time for all three accounts at once.

I have also been stopping trading around 11am and that has been mentally rewarding and rewarding for my accounts. Red or green anything after 11-1130am for me has been far less success. I will be taking a payout tonight in all three accounts… however, there is some backend issues on MFFU right now and if for whatever reason I cant actually request my payout tonight then I will likely not trade tomorrow so I can make sure I get my payouts.",1724962861,831230,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,bc8280f01de350c7491bc153f4d082241ac99a8141288dcf1fc20a92b19e259d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f4cfzc/markets_are_volatile_post_nvda_earnings_82924_spy/
2926,Stock Market Recap 08/29/2024: OpenAI Seeks $100 Billion Valuation + Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom + Dollar General’s Big Miss,"# Markets

* The stock market wrapped up a mixed bag of a day as Wall Street digested Nvidia’s less-than-stellar earnings report. The Dow strutted to a new record high, up 0.59% or 244 points, while the Nasdaq took a hit, dropping 0.23% thanks to Nvidia's continued slump. The S&P 500 played it safe, ending the day pretty much flat.
* On the bright side, solid economic data offered some optimism. The second-quarter GDP got a boost, jobless claims edged lower, and inflation showed signs of cooling, with the PCE price index slowing to 2.5%. While Nvidia’s rough patch dragged tech stocks down, the rest of the market mostly brushed it off, with five of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing in the green. Looks like Wall Street is still banking on some good vibes despite a few hiccups.

# OpenAI Nears Funding Round at More Than $100 Billion Valuation

OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT, is reportedly gearing up to raise a new round of funding that could value the company at a whopping $100 billion. The tech firm, best known for revolutionizing how we chat with machines, is currently deep in discussions to secure several billion dollars from investors.

**The major players?** Thrive Capital is leading the charge, set to throw in a cool $1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) isn't sitting on the sidelines either. The tech giant, which already has a hefty $13 billion stake in OpenAI, is expected to chip in more funds to keep their AI bromance strong.

But that’s not all. Rumor has it Apple and Nvidia might also join the investment frenzy, with Apple looking to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, making your iPhone chats a whole lot smarter. Nvidia, a key supplier for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure, could benefit from increased demand for their chips as OpenAI’s need for computing power grows.

# The AI Arms Race is On

OpenAI’s latest funding effort isn't just about beefing up its balance sheet; it's about keeping its place at the forefront of the AI arms race. The startup is racing against heavyweights like Google, Amazon, and Meta, each pouring billions into developing their own AI tech. Google and Amazon recently backed Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, while Meta is giving away its AI models for free.

With AI predicted to transform the global economy, all the big players are jostling for a piece of the pie. OpenAI’s annualized revenue hit $3.4 billion earlier this year, a figure that's sure to swell as the company rolls out more products and services.

# Cash to Burn

What’s driving this scramble for funds? OpenAI’s ambitions are as high as its valuation. CEO Sam Altman is chasing the lofty goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can outperform humans at just about any job. But achieving AGI isn’t cheap. Building their latest model, GPT-4, set them back over $100 million, and the next one will likely cost even more.

**In-house perks:** The new funding round could also benefit OpenAI’s employees, who might get the chance to cash in some of their shares later this year, according to a memo from CFO Sarah Friar. It’s a sweet deal in a speculative market that isn’t yet raking in cash at the same pace as it’s spending.

# Bottom Line

OpenAI is pushing hard to stay on top in the AI world, and it’s getting the cash to do it. With investors lining up to back the startup, all eyes will be on how it uses these billions to outmaneuver the competition and build the next generation of AI tech. And with Apple and Nvidia potentially joining the fray, the battle for AI supremacy just got even more interesting.

# 



# Market Movements

* **Lululemon Lowers Outlook**: Lululemon ($LULU) lowered its sales and profit outlook for the year as increased competition and relentless inflation curb demand for its pricey yoga pants
* **Ulta Beauty Cuts Forecast**: Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) cut its forecast after seeing a decline in comparable store sales in the second quarter, highlighting US consumers cutting back on makeups and cosmetics.
* **xAI Accused of Pollution**: xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, is being accused by the Southern Environmental Law Center of polluting the air in Memphis, Tennessee with unpermitted natural fas burning turbines
* **Plaud. ai Launches NotePin**: Another AI pin is joining the mix despite Humane’s struggles. Plaud .ai released its $10 NotePin, an “always-ready” wearable promising to record and synthesize transcriptions in meets and on the go.
* **SpaceX Grounded by FAA**: The FAA has grounded SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets after a booster rocket failed during landing yesterday.

# Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom

Dell Technologies ($DELL) is riding the AI wave, and it’s paying off big time. The tech giant reported a 9% jump in total revenue to $25 billion for the fiscal second quarter, crushing Wall Street’s expectations. The driving force? A surge in demand for AI-optimized servers.

# AI Servers: The Star of the Show

Dell’s AI-optimized server sales skyrocketed to $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the prior period. The server unit, part of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, saw a 38% increase in sales to $11.65 billion, beating estimates by a wide margin. Dell's success is largely tied to the booming demand for AI servers, especially those built around Nvidia’s ($NVDA) chips.

Despite some concerns over margins due to the high costs of AI servers and a competitive pricing environment, Dell's operating margin for its infrastructure unit improved to 11%, up from 8% last quarter. This easing of margin worries suggests Dell’s investments in AI are beginning to pay off.

# PC Sales Still in a Slump

While AI servers are flying off the shelves, Dell's traditional PC business is struggling. Revenue from personal computers dropped 4% to $12.4 billion, with consumer sales plummeting 22% from a year ago. The decline reflects the ongoing challenges in the PC market as the pandemic-driven surge in laptop purchases continues to cool down.

Business PC sales remained flat, a stark contrast to rival HP Inc., which saw an 8% gain in enterprise PC sales during the same period. Dell’s COO, Jeff Clarke, noted that recovery in the PC market is still ""a little further out"" than previously anticipated.

# SecureWorks: On the Chopping Block?

In a move to streamline operations, Dell is reportedly exploring the sale of SecureWorks Corp. ($SCWX), a cybersecurity company it currently owns a majority stake in. This isn’t Dell’s first attempt to offload SecureWorks; a previous sale effort back in 2019 fell through. With a market value of about $772 million, SecureWorks’ future under Dell’s umbrella remains uncertain.

# What’s Next for Dell?

Looking ahead, Dell has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $24.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The company also revised its full-year guidance slightly upwards, now expecting between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion in revenue, up from a previous range of $93.5 billion to $97.5 billion.

Dell’s stock has been on a tear this year, up 48% so far. With AI server demand showing no signs of slowing, the company seems well-positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. However, challenges in the PC market and questions about long-term profitability remain on the horizon. For now, though, it seems like Dell is enjoying its moment in the AI spotlight.

# Dollar General’s Big Miss: What Happened?

Dollar General ($DG) just experienced its worst day ever on Wall Street. The discount retailer's shares nosedived 32% after the company slashed its full-year forecast, citing a tough financial climate for its core customers—those living paycheck to paycheck. This is the biggest drop since the company went public in 2009.

# The Bad News

CEO Todd Vasos reported that the company had to cut its 2024 forecasts for comparable sales and earnings due to customers tightening their belts, particularly on essential goods. Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise only 1% to 1.6% for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 2% to 2.7%. The company’s profit forecast was also reduced, predicting earnings per share between $5.50 and $6.20, significantly lower than the previous $6.80 to $7.55.

Sales in the second fiscal quarter fell short of expectations, with earnings per share at $1.70 compared to the $1.79 analysts had anticipated. Revenue was also below forecasts, coming in at $10.21 billion against the predicted $10.37 billion. Despite a slight uptick in traffic, shoppers are spending less per visit, hitting Dollar General where it hurts—right in the sales figures.

# Blame Game

Vasos blamed the poor performance on weakening consumer sentiment among lower-income shoppers, who are finding it harder to make ends meet due to economic pressures like high interest rates. However, other discount retailers like Walmart are reporting strong sales, indicating that the problem might not just be with consumers but also with Dollar General’s execution.

Dollar General is now focusing on “controlling what we can control,” as Vasos put it. This includes efforts to improve store operations and inventory management, but it seems the company still has a long road ahead to turn things around.

# The Ripple Effect

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) wasn’t immune to Dollar General’s woes, with shares sliding 10.24% in sympathy. Big Lots ($BIG) also took a hit, plummeting 38.35%. Meanwhile, Best Buy ($BBY) saw a surge of 14.11%, buoyed by its stronger-than-expected earnings report and a more optimistic consumer outlook.

# What’s Next For The General?

Dollar General’s game plan involves cutting back on new store openings, slashing inventory, and focusing more on essential goods. However, with customers running out of funds towards the end of each month and competition from big players like Walmart, the retailer will need more than just tweaks to its operations to get back on track.

Despite the grim outlook, some analysts are still holding out hope. With an average price target of $144, there’s a belief that the stock could rebound—if Dollar General can address its operational shortcomings and the economic pressure on its customers eases. But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect any blockbuster announcements tomorrow. But before you check out for the long weekend, there’s one final, crucial piece of economic news on the horizon.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)—the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge—is set to drop. For those who aren’t economists in their spare time, PCE measures how much prices are rising or falling across the U.S. economy. The “core” PCE strips out food and energy prices (you know, the stuff that makes your wallet cry at the pump or grocery store) to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation.

And here’s the thing: Everyone is banking on the Fed to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting, no matter what tomorrow’s PCE report shows. But this is the last major inflation reading before the Fed gathers to make its big decision, so the numbers could sway just how aggressive they go with those rate cuts. In other words, tomorrow’s PCE could be the final puzzle piece in the Fed’s inflation-fighting game.",1724972715,831236,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,2f621e010e043280b0d035a2b9738bf3a88d68f75999c3f89de905519cc03db1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f4ga4w/stock_market_recap_08292024_openai_seeks_100/

2937,"Kazatomprom: 17% cut in expected production2025 in Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia of uranium & there already was a global uranium supply problem + Why is uranium demand price INelastic? + Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, physical uranium fund on TSX, trads at big discount to NAV. Imo, not for long anymore","Hi everyone,

Now that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...

The uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \~45% of world production, announced a huge cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts in 2026 and beyond.



A. There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.

Let me explain

a) The gas price represents \~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!

The uranium price only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105

b) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.

c) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)

Those are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**

Utilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME



B. On Friday, Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

Here are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here):

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/zp5878n2jtld1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f3509f6be9b11daea65243981f9fd9d8535873)

**Problem is that:**

a) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.

b) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?

All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.

c) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!

Important to keep in mind here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!

Conclusion:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of the 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world](https://preview.redd.it/f5jakai6jtld1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62a954a2898c4cc67f7d022eb30acc2f33769a8c)

  
Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world).  Here the investor is not subjected to mining related risks.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~24.25 CAD/share or \~18.00 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 8.75%

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.75 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

Uranium sector ETF's:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Next week we will gradually enter the high season again

In the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.

In the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket. Added to that now the announced additional big uranium production cuts.

The uranium spotprice today:

The long term uranium price goes up month after month:

Note: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. Next week we will gradually enter the high season again

2941,"Markets Lack Direction… 8-30-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","Post NVDA earnings I honestly expect this market to take a direction and stick with it… I actually had higher and better expectations for yesterday to breakout and for today to break down… the market is honestly just stuck…. Bulls cant commit (despite stronger daily buyers today finally) to a breakout and bears cant (despite sellers this week on NQ) take it lower… It also appears buyers/ sellers are often times working again the VIX…

Honestly it really just seems like the algos have this pinned and aren’t ready to let it go one way or another yet…

Do not forget that markets are CLOSED on Monday… it is labor day!

After we get to enjoy our three day weekend we will hit hard with some data Wednesday through Friday. I do anticipate JOLTS and Unemployment rate to be a pretty big market mover next week.

Going into this week my general expectations due to the stronger weekly buyers and breakout over supply was a continuation higher… I did from a daily perspective see a decently downside case for the early week… in the end we ended up with a choppy flat slightly red week.

We did get the backtest off 554.7 supply I expected last week in my TA… I did think we would bounce and go higher to ATHs but it appears with stronger weekly buyers once again that we could see the breakout to ATHs next week.

Bulls targets are 570-575 and bears need to CLOSE under 554.7.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 554.7  
Demand- 532.86

Much like SPY we have continued to have stronger weekly buyers and we got our weekly 8 ema and weekly supply at 5614 support backtest. This support backtest is very important for bulls as it likely is what allows them to breakout next week.

Bulls will target a breakout to ATHs of 5721 with ultimate massive breakout being 5800.

Bears must CLOSE under weekly 8ema support of 5544.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5614

Now switching over to TECH which again has been in my opinion what is holding ES/ SPY down from seeking ATHs… I almost see a different story here… on SPY/ ES I truly see a decently bullish case for next week.

On QQQ our weekly buyers finally weakened and we actually got a nice weekly double top. Now the one thing I will say is historically that these candles lead to double bottoms and breakouts…

Bulls did hold support of the weekly 8ema backtest which is very important. That 470 level is what bears need to CLOSE under. From here bulls must close over 480 double top and seek out 496.33 supply.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 496.33

I am seeing a lot of the same thing here on NQ… the few weekly buyers we did have last week have weakened again this week now… we got a nice double top off 19772 but at the same time had a very important support backtest and bounce off weekly 8 and 20ema support.

Again from here bulls must close over 19772 and bears must close under 19090.

This has probably been my best week of trading futures/ prop firms ever… I humbly killed it… the market finally was readable for me (short term). A few things I did this week was to go back to not taking multiple trades at the same time (kinda broke that rule today though) and most importantly after I was green I just stopped and walked away…

My wife worked so it was my first time home with the baby alone and being big green before 1030am and being able to walk way and enjoy the rest of my day with the baby is honestly incredibly rewarding.

I know some people like to bust my balls saying I don’t make enough to be considered a trading or to “make it worth it” but I live a very humble and chill life. Its not about the lambos and mansions for me… its about having a career that allows me to see my kids and wife as much as I can and be present in their lives more than a normal job would. Day trading is one of the only jobs in the world that you can lose money “going to work” but it is also one of the most rewarding careers when you have a marathon versus sprint mindset.

I plan to enjoy my 3 day weekend with the family and hit it again next week.",1725051924,831243,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,689b816f9e6192643bd7160c543272f25e87e8cb7f8e9516ec6b886b170bed2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f5663l/markets_lack_direction_83024_spy_es_futures_and/
2942,"Stock Market Recap 08/30/2024: Intel Considers Splitting Up + Earnings Roundup of Lululemon, Ulta and Crowdstrike","# Markets

* The stock market ended a turbulent August on a high, with investors cheering as fresh inflation data boosted hopes for a September rate cut. The Dow Jones ticked up 0.55%, hitting yet another record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.01% and 1.13%, respectively. The Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose just enough to keep everyone optimistic but not worried.
* While August was anything but calm—starting with growth fears and a mini-selloff—investors came around to the idea that the economy might be landing softly after all. The Dow and S&P 500 chalked up another month of gains, but the Nasdaq couldn’t quite shake off a rough patch for tech stocks. In the end, it’s a mixed bag, but one that leans bullish as we head into September.

* **Dell Technologies** ($DELL) rose 4.33% after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and raising its full-year outlook, driven by increased demand for its AI-powered servers.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",1725062439,831246,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,44d5b8bbd34ed535ca5d0b063bf45aa216f1abca8c84f99efd333e46d3d5746d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f5a16w/stock_market_recap_08302024_intel_considers/

BOGO distinguishes itself as a revenue-generating junior exploration company with a fully permitted mine and state-of-the-art  ADR facility, which poured its first gold bar last year.

https://preview.redd.it/tv77i9865wld1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=9729b38bce0c97c4f691fe72d4ef4acc0c083d53

Earlier this week, BOGO announced its first gold pour of 2024 at the on-site ADR facility, marking a significant milestone for the company. 



The gold pour was accomplished by stripping 2.5 out of the company’s 10 carbon columns, loaded from residual leaching using a highly dilute cyanide solution. 



This initial pour produced doré bars weighing approximately 651 troy ounces, containing 143 troy ounces of gold and 131 troy ounces of silver, as confirmed by an independent assay.



Looking ahead, BOGO plans to strip the remaining 7.5 carbon columns and introduce fresh cyanide to a previously unleached section of the leach pad, which is expected to yield doré bars with a higher gold percentage. 



The company has submitted super sacks of spent carbon fines to Just Refiners (USA) Inc. in Reno, NV, which contain an estimated 76.504 troy ounces of gold and 305.012 troy ounces of silver.



Additionally, BOGO is seeking contractors to crush its 330,000-ton stockpile of ore, which is anticipated to further boost gold production.



In other company news, Borealis has appointed Ms. Lisanna Lewis as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Mr. Mike Dai. Ms. Lewis brings two decades of experience in mining financial operations, particularly within Nevada.



Her career began at the Borealis mine in 2004, where she has been involved in every stage from exploration to production. Borealis expresses gratitude to Mr. Dai for his service and wishes him success in his future endeavors.

For example, in my own journey, I struggled with understanding how to read financial statements. The amount of metrics was overwhelming, and I often wished for an app that could simplify the learning process by prioritizing key topics.

The reason I'm asking is that, as a financial educator, I'm looking to better understand the needs of new investors. Your feedback will help me develop resources that address these challenges more effectively.

The ticker is **HOVR**—yes, it’s all about hovercrafts.

# Reasons to Watch HOVR:

1. **The Chart:**
   * The chart has been beaten down, which lowers our risk. It’s starting to curl upwards, indicating a potential bull run. The market cap is also positioned well for outsized gains.
2. **Innovative Edge:**
   * HOVR is at the forefront of innovation, particularly within military sectors globally. Their reach extends across various industries, but the military sector—backed by the US Air Force—is especially promising.
3. **Strong Patents:**
   * HOVR’s patented fan-in-wing design gives them a competitive advantage, allowing them to maximize returns from their hard work.
4. **Leadership Boost:**
   * A new, highly experienced CTO has just joined the team, ensuring that HOVR continues on the right path.

I’ll be following this company throughout the week. Good luck to those trading it!

# Upcoming Targets (Full DD and TA to come):

1. $1.03
2. $1.09
3. $1.14
4. $1.29 (\~29% gain)

**In conclusion,** this is one to keep on your radar. I’m really into their mission and find the company incredibly interesting. Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!

2949,"Bears Come Out Swinging… 9-3-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","Sometimes you just truly never know what this markets going to do… many assumed the close on Friday meant a breakout on the markets and that we would be seeing a nice big green day today… however, today ended up being an extremely bloody day for SPY and QQQ.

Now the question is like Fridays bull trap is this just an epic bear trap or did we just start the next leg down?

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/y7lejh7pinmd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5e70c80974b6e069cabdf92d47b7ea452820a8

Despite the fact that we put in a new demand and had stronger daily buyers on SPY Friday we ended up doing one of the most impressive non event/ data driven reversals ive seen in a while. The bears brought back in daily sellers today and put in a new supply at 563.75. Not only that but they closed below the double demand/ support area of 556.16 to 558.24. This effectively breaks the daily range support we have been in for almost 3 weeks now.

With a breakdown of the daily 8 and 20ema support here it would appear that we are headed for the daily 50ema support near 546.92. If bears can close below that level we will see a bigger move down to the 100ema at 536.06.

Bulls must recover over 563.75-564.94 to be back in control.

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 563.75 -> 564.94  
Demand- 556.16 -> 558.24

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/dxjydilpinmd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f306f70f4a7c3ab49f96b5d8a322b2a4a8f939d

It is not too often that you get a bearish engulfing candle for 11 days of price action but here we are… a 120+ plus drop from high to low is very impressive for a random Tuesday. With a closure under the daily 20ema support, a new supply at 5657 and closure below previous demand/ range support of 5580 it would appear bears are ready to revisit the daily 50ema support near 5511.

Bulls must minimally breakout over the daily supply/ range resistance of 5657.

ES FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 5657 -> 5716  
Demand- 5580

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/13x8f9wpinmd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=864e55981367e511dfaaa0167357e7532d4023e5

QQQ has been the one I have focused on the most lately as I said despite SPY/ ES strength we did not see the same out of QQQ/ NQ… this once again as you can see by the yellow bear channel is a lower high and lower low breakdown… not only that but we have had three days of stronger daily sellers now.

Bears put in a new supply at 476.34 today also and closed under the daily demand of 470.63. I am actually very impressed that the daily demand was broken and the daily 20/50ema supports. As of now daily 100ema support of 460.51 appears to be our target.

Bulls must minimally retake daily supply at 476.34.

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 476.34 -> 481.27 -> 482.4  
Demand- 470.63

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/a1ktac8qinmd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc0095ef7cd6a9c561e44e4ef8fb4c8ba31f660

Here on NQ we also got a new supply at 19591. The most impressive thing here was actually the fact that we had stronger daily buyers at open… despite that we actually broke down low enough today to bring in stronger daily sellers. NQ came down to its daily 100ema support and as of now that is likely where we will spend some time fighting.

Bulls must minimally recover over the daily supply of 19591.

Bears now will target 200 ema near 18165.

NQ FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
Supply- 19591 -> 19922 -> 19986  
Demand- 19306 -> 19803

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/22la0ljqinmd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a51a72a988f806ec29faee2e4c4da0e6bfc16e

I would like to say that there was a bigger sign here from the VIX Friday that this would happen but honestly there just wasn’t… the only thing I can see is that despite the fact that ES closed over its range resistance we did NOT close below range support of 14.63 on VIX…

The VIX got a new demand at 14.95 today and in a very impressive almost 30% move today close over triple supply/ resistance of 17.12 to 18.61…

It would appear (And the bears need it) that we are looking for a closing move back over the 21.29-22.67 area. 26.17 would likely start another major correction lower.

Today was once again a great day of trading… I was able to put in my 8^(th) green day in a row. While I generally hate streaks like this it is still a very impressive and notable green stretch for me. After quite a few weeks of struggling in this market I finally have gotten my reads back.

I continue to take my first play as a loss unfortunately though. However, today that loss was because I was about 1.5 pt too early on my short before it of course dumped.

Overall nothing to say here besides I remain humble and while confidence is key I have no desire to get over confident. I continue to attempt to be done trading by 11am to avoid just that.",1725394181,831233,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,f96415a2dbd975119f5e61fce637d3474e5592f62bfd53109e602c1fee88706a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f89xwz/bears_come_out_swinging_9324_spy_es_futures_and/

2951,Stock Market Today 09/03/2024: September: The Worst Month For Stocks + Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? ,"# MARKETS 

* Stocks kicked off September on a sour note, suffering their worst day since the market sell-off in early August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1.51%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 tumbled 2.12%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite bore the brunt of the sell-off, dropping 3.26%, dragged down by a sharp decline in technology and semiconductor stocks like Nvidia.
* This downturn was fueled by fresh economic data that rekindled fears of a slowing economy, with key indicators such as the ISM purchasing managers' index and construction spending showing unexpected declines.
* The market's poor performance reflects a renewed wave of anxiety over economic growth and the health of the labor market, amplified by expectations of upcoming economic reports. 



# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

# Worst Month for Stocks: September

Ah, September—the month when Halloween decorations start creeping onto store shelves, and if you’re a stock market investor, a time when your portfolio might give you a scare. Historically, September has been a nightmare for Wall Street, and 2024 is shaping up to be just as spooky.

# A Historical Downer

Let’s get straight to the point: September tends to suck for stocks. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) dips 1.51%, the S&P 500 ($SPX) drops 2.12%, the Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) falls 3.26%, and the Russell 2000 ($RUT) slides 3.09%. And these numbers aren't just random blips—they reflect over a century of data. It’s like Groundhog Day, but instead of six more weeks of winter, you get a month of losses.

If that wasn’t enough to make you want to close your brokerage account and head for the hills, bond investors don’t fare much better. The iShares U.S. Treasury bond ETF ($GOVT), which tracks the broad U.S. government bond market, typically has its worst month in September too. This is the part where you cue the sad trombone.

# So, Why the Gloom?

Why does September get such a bad rap? Analysts have a few theories. After a summer of sand and sun, traders return to their desks and start to reassess their portfolios, which often means selling off high-fliers. Plus, companies begin thinking about their year-end financials, making it a prime time to offload some winners to balance out the losers. It’s like a spring cleaning—only, you know, in the fall.

But it’s not all bad news. Stocks actually finished August strong, buoyed by surprisingly robust economic data that calmed fears about a faltering job market. And with the Federal Reserve likely to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years at their next meeting on September 18, there’s a sliver of hope that things could turn around.

Adding to the uncertainty, the August jobs report is due out on September 6. If it disappoints, we could see another selloff like we did last month when the July numbers came in lower than expected.

And let’s not forget about the looming presidential election and the ongoing tension in the Middle East, which could escalate into a full-blown conflict involving major oil producers like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

# The Bright Side?

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that gold and the U.S. dollar—two traditional safe havens—have historically performed better in September. So, while stocks might be in for a rough ride, there are still places to park your money if you’re feeling scared.

# 



# Market Movements

* Intel’s Potential Dow Jones Exit: Intel ($INTC) faces the possibility of being removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to a nearly 60% drop in its stock price this year, making it the index's worst performer.
* ByteDance Pursues Massive Loan: TikTok owner ByteDance is seeking a $9.5 billion loan with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan as coordinators. The loan includes a 3-year term, extendable to 5 years, and will partially refinance an existing $5 billion loan.
* Amazon Strengthens AI Robotics: Amazon ($AMZN) has hired the founders of AI robotics startup Covariant, along with a portion of its employees, and secured a license to use its AI technology for robotic operations. This strategic move allows Amazon to enhance its warehouse robotics capabilities without a full acquisition.
* Illumina Wins Legal Battle: Illumina won its court battle against the European Union’s investigation of its $7.1 billion Grail acquisition, with the court ruling that the European Commission overstepped its authority.
* Volkswagen Considers Factory Closures: Volkswagen is contemplating closing factories in Germany for the first time in its history due to profitability challenges and increasing competition from Asian competitors.
* Intel’s New Processor Launch: Intel ($INTC) launched its second-generation Core Ultra 200V processors, aiming to improve battery life and performance to better compete with Qualcomm and AMD in the laptop market. The new chips boast significant power efficiency and enhanced AI capabilities, positioning Intel to regain market share against its rivals.
* Nokia’s New Contract with AT&T: Nokia signed a 5-year deal with AT&T to build a fiber network in the U.S.after losing a major telecom network contract to Ericsson.

# Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? 

DirecTV subscribers might want to double-check their TV listings this week because ESPN, Disney, ABC, and a host of other channels just vanished. Yep, you read that right—Disney pulled its programming from DirecTV, including streaming services like Hulu, due to a contract dispute.

# What Happened?

The blackout happened at a pretty inconvenient time for sports fans. With the new college football season in full swing and the U.S. Open tennis tournament heating up, DirecTV viewers were left hanging. ESPN cut out during fourth-round U.S. Open matches at 7:20 p.m. ET, and just minutes before a big football game between LSU and USC. Needless to say, fans were not happy, flooding social media with complaints.

DirecTV is the third-largest pay TV provider in the U.S., with 11.3 million customers who suddenly have a lot less to watch. The main sticking point? Carriage fees—the amount DirecTV pays Disney to carry its channels. DirecTV wants more flexibility in choosing which channels to offer its customers, while Disney is pushing for a bundled approach that would keep all their channels together, which typically costs subscribers more.

# Why the Blackout?

At its core, this dispute is about money—surprise, surprise. DirecTV argues that Disney is being anti-consumer by insisting on bundled packages that drive up costs. For example, ESPN's monthly fee has jumped to about $10, up 40% from $7.19 in 2019. DirecTV’s CFO, Ray Carpenter, claims customers are tired of these ""bloated packages"" that force them to pay for channels they don’t watch. Disney, on the other hand, says it’s not going to sign any deals that undervalue its content.

# When Will This End?

Unfortunately, no one knows when the channels will be back. Blackouts like these can last anywhere from a few days to several years, depending on how quickly both parties can reach an agreement. DirecTV is giving its customers a $20 credit as a consolation, but that’s cold comfort for sports fans missing out on their favorite games.

# What Can You Do?

If you’re a DirecTV subscriber missing out on Disney’s channels, you have some options. You could switch to a streaming service like YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV, both of which offer Disney’s full lineup. Just be prepared to shell out between $73 and $80 a month, depending on the service.

In the meantime, keep your fingers crossed that Disney and DirecTV can sort this out before the next big game or episode of your favorite show.

# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is packed with key labor market data, starting with tomorrow's release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS report provides a snapshot of the previous month’s job openings, hires, and separations (like layoffs and retirements) across the U.S. It's a critical indicator of labor market health, especially the job openings figure, which sheds light on the demand for workers.

The previous JOLTS data showed little change, with job openings at 8.18 million—down by 941,000 from a year ago—while the job openings rate held steady at 4.9%. For the upcoming report, economists expect the number of job openings to be slightly lower, around 8.09 million, which isn't expected to cause much concern in the markets.

# Earnings:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

# Before Market Open:

* **Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS)** has had a stellar year in 2024, perhaps too much so. While the company boasts a solid balance sheet with plenty of cash to fuel growth or reward shareholders, its stock is currently priced high, suggesting limited upside. Analysts are cautious, recommending a tentative buy. The consensus estimates are earnings per share (EPS) of $3.81 on $3.44 billion in revenue.
* **Dollar Tree ($DLTR)**, on the other hand, has faced a challenging year, struggling amid high inflation that has particularly affected lower-income consumers. However, with inflation easing and potential rate cuts on the horizon, the outlook might brighten for both the company and its customers. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, noting the stock has significant upside, with the average price target suggesting a 55% increase from current levels. The consensus estimates for Dollar Tree are $1.05 EPS on $7.50 billion in revenue.",1725405707,831249,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,24876533997fc048aa2b8a9aeea6c3407d174458bc86e3511f8553850547a911,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f8e9mx/stock_market_today_09032024_september_the_worst/

The potential for substantial growth seems evident, given their ambitious exploration goals in district-scale projects.

2957,News Breakdown Post: West Red Lake Gold (WRLG.v) Provides Madsen Gold Mine Restart Update Today,"Today, West Red Lake Gold Mines Ltd. (Ticker: WRLG.v or WRLGF for U.S. investors)  released an update on its progress towards the planned 2025 restart of the Madsen Mine. Since acquiring the Madsen Mine, the company has completed a thorough operational assessment and is now focused on optimizing both surface and underground upgrades.

**Key Updates:**

* *Definition Drilling*: Since October 2023, West Red Lake Gold has conducted over 40,000 meters of definition drilling in the project's Austin, South Austin, and McVeigh areas. This drilling is crucial for developing an accurate geological model that will mitigate risks and guide the mine's operational plans.



* *Tailings Storage Facility Expansion:* A project to raise the tailings dam by 4 meters, critical for extending operational capacity for 10 years, is 60% complete and tracking ahead of schedule.



* *Connection Drift:* Work began in August to drive a 1,200-meter haulage drift connecting the East and West ramps, which is now 5% complete and expected to finish by February 2025. This project aims to reduce inefficiencies in material movement.



* *Mine Dewatering:* The company has successfully lowered water levels in the mine, essential for accessing deeper mineralization. Recent installation of evaporator fans will help maintain these efforts.



* *Primary Crusher Procurement:* A primary jaw crusher has been ordered and is set for delivery in October. The electric primary jaw crusher is capable of reducing rock from a feed size of 19.6 inches down to 4 inches or smaller. It can handle up to 145 tonnes of rock per hour, while the mill at the Madsen Mine has a capacity of processing 800 tonnes per day.



* *Workforce Accommodations:* The company has secured accommodations for 114 employees and will have these facilities ready by February 2025, enhancing the site's infrastructure.



* *Leadership Additions*: West Red Lake Gold has hired experienced personnel, including David Towle as Mill Manager and Gavin Clow as Chief Engineer, to lead critical operational areas.



These activities represent significant strides in the restart of the Madsen Mine, positioning the company for a successful ramp-up in 2025.

2958,Stock Market Today 09/04/2024: 🏦 Viral Chase Bank Glitch + Dollar Tree Earnings Disappoint,"# MARKETS

* Worries about a cooling labor market had the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting the snooze button for the second day in a row, slipping 0.16% and 0.3%, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, decided to buck the trend, adding a modest 38 points, or 0.09%. This mixed bag comes as traders nervously eye the upcoming jobs report, with fresh data showing U.S. job openings fell to 7.7 million in July — the lowest since 2021 and worse than expected.
* As if the markets needed more jitters, manufacturing weakness and declining job openings are rekindling recession fears. Investors are now playing the guessing game on whether the Federal Reserve will step in with rate cuts sooner rather than later. Treasury yields dropped faster than your favorite meme stock, as traders doubled down on bets for a bigger-than-expected rate cut in 2024. All eyes are now on Friday’s payrolls report, which could either calm nerves or send the markets spiraling again.

# Chase A Check… Or Maybe 3 Years In Prison

Hold onto your debit cards, folks! Chase Bank has come forward to debunk a viral trend that’s been circulating on TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). The so-called ""glitch"" that supposedly lets users deposit fake checks and withdraw real money? Yeah, not a glitch. It’s fraud.

Over the weekend, videos flooded social media with users claiming they could deposit phony checks at Chase ATMs and withdraw the funds before the bank caught on. Spoiler alert: it’s a crime. Chase quickly addressed the situation, reminding customers that this is fraud, ""plain and simple."" The bank's message was clear—no matter what TikTok tells you, check fraud is still very much illegal.

# Check Out the Reality Check

Despite what the hype might suggest, this isn't some revolutionary new money hack. The tactic of depositing fake checks and withdrawing cash before they bounce is as old as checks themselves. Fraudsters usually pull this off by opening accounts under fake names, but this time around, people tried it with their own accounts—making it super easy for Chase to identify and slam the door shut.

In a statement, a Chase spokesperson said, ""We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed."" Translation: We caught on fast, and we're not amused.

# TikTok’ers Learn the Hard Way

The internet had a field day with this one. What started as videos of users showing off stacks of cash quickly turned into clips of them facing massive negative balances and holds on their accounts. One user summed it up perfectly: “Chase Bank glitch? No, that’s called fraud. You went to the bank and took $50,000 that didn’t belong to you. That’s not a life hack; that’s called robbery.”

So, here’s the takeaway: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to real jobs or legit side hustles, and leave the check fraud to the scammers. They’re not going to win any awards, but at least they know what they’re signing up for.

* Sony Pulls Game Due to Low Engagement: Sony ($SONY) pulled its online shooter “Concord” from sale just two weeks after its release due to low player engagement. The game had taken eight years to develop.
* Hewlett Packard Seeks Damages: Hewlett Packard ($HPE) is seeking up to $4 billion in civil fraud damages from the estate of Mike Lynch, who died in a yacht accident in August. The claim is related to HPE’s acquisition of Lynch’s company Autonomy, which led to an $8.8 billion write-down after accusations of inflated business performance.

# Dollar Tree Earnings Disappoint — Stock Falls Sharply

# By the Numbers:

* **Stock Drop:** -22%
* **Q2 Revenue:** $7.38 billion (vs. $7.49 billion expected)
* **Q2 Adjusted EPS:** $0.97 (vs. $1.04 expected)
* **Revised Full-Year Revenue Forecast:** $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion (down from $31 billion to $32 billion)
* **Revised Full-Year Adjusted EPS:** $5.20 to $5.60 (down from $6.50 to $7.00)
* **Same-Store Sales Growth:** +0.7% overall; +1.3% at Dollar Tree stores; -0.1% at Family Dollar stores

Not everything is priced at a dollar, including Dollar Tree’s ($DLTR) stock, which plunged over 22% on Wednesday after the company slashed its full-year outlook. The discount retailer blamed rising pressures on middle- and higher-income customers who are feeling the pinch and spending less on non-essentials.

# What Went Wrong?

Dollar Tree had to face some harsh realities this quarter. The company now expects its full-year net sales to come in between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion, a drop from the previously anticipated $31 billion to $32 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were also revised down to a range of $5.20 to $5.60, from a higher $6.50 to $7. Not exactly the kind of news investors were hoping for.

So, what’s causing all this trouble? According to CFO Jeff Davis, the company is dealing with softer sales, especially on the discretionary side—basically, anything that isn't an absolute necessity. They’ve also had to pay more in costs related to customer accidents at their stores and expenses from converting 99 Cents Only stores. Not the most fun way to spend your cash.

# Dollar Stores Aren’t Feeling So Discounted

Dollar Tree isn’t the only one feeling the burn. Last week, Dollar General also cut its full-year forecast, noting that its core customers are feeling financially squeezed. Meanwhile, big names like Walmart and even online newcomers like Temu are capturing the attention of budget-conscious shoppers.

For Dollar Tree, same-store sales in the latest quarter inched up by just 0.7%, with the Dollar Tree stores themselves seeing a 1.3% rise and Family Dollar stores dipping slightly by 0.1%. The modest gains are a clear sign that customers are tightening their belts and making fewer trips for non-essentials.

# Facing Headwinds and Hard Choices

Beyond consumer belt-tightening, Dollar Tree is grappling with some company-specific challenges. It’s shutting down about 1,000 underperforming Family Dollar stores and might even sell off the Family Dollar brand. This move comes after struggling to integrate the grocery-focused chain, which it bought for nearly $9 billion in 2015.

On top of that, the company’s dealing with a slew of liability claims from customer accidents, which are proving to be more costly and unpredictable than expected. These added expenses aren’t doing any favors for their bottom line.

Dollar Tree is hoping that the back-to-school season and upcoming holidays might give them a boost, but with consumers being extra cautious with their spending, it might take more than just a sale on party supplies to turn things around. Until then, it’s clear that not even Dollar Tree can escape the effects of a tough economic climate.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow's lineup has the labor market taking center stage with two big headliners: the ADP Employment Report and initial jobless claims, both dropping bright and early.

First up, the ADP Employment Report—our monthly pulse check on private sector hiring. Last time around, the report showed 122,000 new jobs, paired with a 4.8% bump in annual pay. Decent stats, but they didn’t exactly get economists popping champagne. For July, the forecast is a bit more festive, with predictions of 140,000 new jobs.

On the flip side, initial jobless claims will tell us how many folks filed for unemployment benefits last week. The latest count was 231,000, a slight dip of 2,000 from the week before. The experts are crossing their fingers for a further drop to 225,000 in tomorrow's report.

# Before Market Open:

* **Nio** ($NIO) has been on a rough road this year, heading mostly downhill. The Chinese electric vehicle maker is facing fierce competition at home, struggling to turn a profit, and consistently falling short on delivery targets. With so many strikes against it, Nio isn’t exactly inspiring confidence among investors. Unless you’re feeling particularly adventurous, this might be one to watch from the sidelines for now. The consensus is a loss of $0.31 per share on $2.44 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Broadcom** ($AVGO) has lagged behind its AI-driven peers this year, despite delivering robust earnings. Investors have been cautious due to the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy, which has significantly increased its debt load. However, management is confident that these moves will drive substantial sales growth and strengthen the balance sheet in the future. Wall Street seems optimistic, with 22 out of 23 analysts rating the stock a buy and setting an average price target 27% above its current level. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.09 per share on $11.71 billion in revenue.",1725495104,831223,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,b863b0090ebc90d728fdb6909cacb65fd3fd8f837b12433dd50a0033d9b77bb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f98tyb/stock_market_today_09042024_viral_chase_bank/
2959,Bloomberg Falsified Nvidia DOJ Probe Report,"It is absurd that a frivolous report from Bloomberg News wiped out nearly $350 Billion of Nvidia market cap. Nvidia is in the midst of providing the world's most powerful compute through its gpu processer chips. Powering all things accelerated compute and especially general artificial intelligence. 

Tech has been the economy the past 2-3 years and a host of companies including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google, X, AWS, and Anthropic in the United States have thrived. 

Yes, there is competition with China in this space but once again the United States is leading the way with innovative new technologies. AI is truly the new industrial revolution. 

Apparently, not everyone is happy about this. The media has been on a relentless attack against all things AI with Nvidia being the whipping boy poster child. I imagine there are a several reasons for this. 

1. It's providing the weaponry, or rather compute power, for said technologies. 

2. It's actually the closest investment one can make into this AI tech boom as the actual tech is from new startups that aren't listed publicly.

3. The media in general which has been under profitable pressures for decades by the advent of the internet, declining viewership, lack of engagement,  decreasing clear mechanisms of deployment, and overall distrust of certain news outlets has caused angst and ire tiwards anything that may erode that further. 

4. In relation to point 3, it seems as if medis such as Bloomberg and the new york times are deathly afraid of what may be considered a complete subversion of their paywall is the notion that someone can go to a compute device and ask it a question and get a coherent and concise response. By far, I think this is the driving force if what scares certain media the most. 

Bloomberg, as of late, has been by far the worst offender of blatant Nvidia stock manipulation with CNBC not being far behind. Make no mistake, on all of these networks and platforms, Gil Luria has been the goto champion of the manipulation tactics. It was supposed to be at 6:30 Est a little after the Nvidia ER CC. 

Case in point, even before Bloomberg's completely made up DOJ investigation suspeona [report](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-did-not-receive-us-justice-department-subpoena-spokesperson-says-2024-09-04/) they had done something that was incredible to me. 

They had an advert for a post Nvidia earnings report with Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang. 

The problem is when you tuned in to Bloomberg news at the 6:30 time it was 2 backwards analyst giving outright absurd Nvidia and AI bearish takes. And not just a little post earnings slump bearish takes, I mean overt outright lying stock manipulation bearish takes. 

The first analyst said the reason why Nvidia Stock fell is that Jensen was coy and elusive when responding to Blackwell gpu delays. And I quote, ""We wanted him to wrap his [Jensen's] arms around us to make feel all warm and comforting"" and that ""he didn't do that and he was avoiding the questions"". 

I was on the call, Jensen was very clear. Next, Gil Luria comes on to continue the Nvidia Stock bashing for no reason. Coming up with bullshit false lies about how nobody is using AI for anything and there is no way to make money from it. On and on,just ignoring everything Jensen was squeaking about directly on his CCall.

At about 18 minutes into the time of the interview they finally let Jensen on air. The host was extremely rude and hostile to him right from the start. 

You could tell Jensen was visibly upset by what he had just witnessed probably via his watching the 2 analysts conversations prior. His first initial response was ""I thought I was being clear"" [there won't be a delay]. 

You can watch the entire sharade here. It's kind of amazing they actually posted this video to imortalize it.

2964,Big Funding for HOVR and Key Technical Levels to Watch,"Good morning and happy Thursday! I wanted to drop some technical analysis (TA) for HOVR, and also highlight some exciting news:

# $2.9M in Funding Secured

Yes, you read that right. A company with a market cap of about $25M just secured $2.9M in funding. That’s more than 10% of its total market cap!

Here are the key findings from my TA:

* **Support Levels**:
   * Daily Support from $0.84 to $0.89
   * Historical Support from $0.62 to $0.75
* **Resistance**: At $1.05, but if we break through that, it's smooth sailing to $1.14 and beyond.
* **EMA Crossover**: The 9EMA and 21EMA have crossed bullish on the daily chart and remain bullish.
* **Volume Uptick**: We saw an increase in volume yesterday and mid-August—always a good sign.
   * Remember, volume **precedes** price action.
* **Algo Flip**: My algo flipped bullish on July 25th, and I’ve been keeping a close watch ever since.

2969,Outcrop Silver Expands 2024 Exploration at Santa Ana with Promising High-Priority Targets (News Summary) ,"Yesterday, Outcrop Silver & Gold Corporation (Ticker: OCG.v or OCGSF for US investors) provided an update on its ongoing 2024 exploration activities at the Santa Ana high-grade silver project in Colombia.



The Santa Ana project, spanning 27,000 hectares in the Mariquita District, is recognized as the largest and highest-grade primary silver district in Colombia. Outcrop Silver's goal is to significantly expand the known resource area along the project's 17-kilometer strike of permitted drill targets, within an extensive 30-kilometer mineralized trend.



Outcrop Silver's ongoing exploration at the Santa Ana project has delivered promising results across several high-priority target areas, supporting the company’s strategy to efficiently expand its resource base. 



The exploration program, which includes drilling, trenching, soil sampling, and mapping, is focused on extending known mineralized zones and identifying new targets. This approach aims to boost the resource potential by concentrating efforts on key zones such as La Ye, La Rica, Morena, and Los Mangos.

https://preview.redd.it/z0t0r434p2nd1.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40a503a140ae4ac93c395e65a4a72f025fad2914



*La Ye Vein System:* A priority target with a 500-meter strike length, where high-grade silver equivalent values have been identified, including up to **4,898 grams per tonne** from chip samples and **2,553 grams per tonne** in channel samples. 



*Morena Vein Discovery:* Located 1 km northeast of La Ye, this new target has shown potential for further exploration, with samples returning grades of up to **1,237 grams per tonne** of silver equivalent. It is expected to contribute significantly to the resource expansion efforts.



*La Rica Vein System:* Discovered during reconnaissance work along the Frias-Santa Ana trend, La Rica has returned high silver equivalent grades in surface samples, including up to **4,113 grams per tonne**. This system is set for further exploration as part of the broader resource growth strategy.



*La Quebrada Vein:* A parallel vein system within the project area that has shown high gold and silver grades. Samples have yielded up to **30.79 grams per tonne of gold and 412 grams per tonne of silver**, making it a key target for upcoming drilling.

2970,Stock Market Today 09/05/2024: Verizon To Acquire Frontier + All Eyes on Friday's Jobs Report,"# MARKETS

* Stocks stumbled on Thursday as investors played a game of wait-and-see ahead of Friday's all-important jobs report. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, the Dow dropped 219 points (0.54%), and the Nasdaq managed a modest 0.25% gain after a rollercoaster of a day. All eyes are on the labor market, with fresh data showing private payrolls posted their smallest growth since January 2021. Not exactly the boost of confidence Wall Street was hoping for.
* Now, the spotlight shifts to Friday’s Labor Department report, which could set the stage for the Fed's next move. With inflation cooling, there's chatter of interest rate cuts, but how deep they’ll go depends on what tomorrow’s numbers reveal. As markets bounced around, tech stocks lifted the Nasdaq while bond yields slipped. All bets are on Jerome Powell to guide the Fed’s hand — will it be a 25 or 50 basis point rate cut? Stay tuned.

# Verizon To Acquire Frontier

Verizon is making some serious moves in the broadband game, dropping $9.6 billion to acquire Frontier Communications. Toss in Frontier’s debt, and the total deal hits $20 billion, giving Verizon access to Frontier’s 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states. Why does this matter? Verizon is locking down its spot in the fiber race, going head-to-head with AT&T and cable companies that are nibbling away at its market share.

# A Strategic Fiber Expansion

Frontier’s investors are walking away with a nice 37% premium at $38.50 per share. For Verizon, it’s a big pivot as it looks to bulk up its fiber footprint in key markets. By scooping up Frontier’s assets, Verizon merges those with its 7.4 million Fios subscribers in nine states and Washington, D.C. Fun fact: some of these assets were actually Verizon’s before they sold them to Frontier in 2016 for $10.54 billion. CEO Hans Vestberg said this is all about “future-proofing” as data demand keeps exploding, thanks to AI and other data-hungry technologies.

# The Fiber Race Heats Up

Everyone wants in on the fiber game these days. AT&T is going all out with its own fiber network expansion, while T-Mobile just threw down $4.9 billion on a joint venture to boost its fiber capabilities. Verizon’s acquisition of Frontier, though, gives it a big leg up in the race to deliver faster and more reliable internet to customers. With wireless growth slowing, telecoms are betting that home internet is the next cash cow.

But it’s not all smooth sailing. Frontier’s stock dipped 9.3% after the news, as investors brace for what could be a lengthy regulatory review. There’s also doubt about whether any other bidders will emerge. The deal is expected to take around 18 months to close, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Verizon, already carrying over $120 billion in debt, is banking on $500 million in annual cost savings by year three to make this deal worth it.

# What’s Next for Verizon?

This acquisition signals Verizon’s commitment to going fiber-first. With Frontier’s assets in key areas like California, Texas, and Florida, Verizon will now serve a total of 10 million fiber-optic customers. It’s still playing catch-up to AT&T’s 28 million, but this is a step in the right direction. Even though Verizon’s fiber network will cover less than 10% of the U.S., the company sees this deal as a building block for bigger broadband dominance.

In a nutshell, Verizon is doubling down on fiber to keep up with our increasingly data-hungry world. It’s a high-stakes play, but if the company can execute, this move could give it a major leg up as the demand for faster, more reliable internet continues to surge. And don’t be surprised if the fiber race gets even more competitive from here.

# All Eyes on Friday's Jobs Report

Friday’s jobs report could be the mic drop moment for the U.S. economy, with Wall Street bracing for impact. Economists are expecting a moderate gain of 161,000 jobs in August, a slight improvement from July’s underwhelming 114,000, and a dip in unemployment to 4.2%. But don’t be fooled by the numbers; a recent wave of grim data suggests the labor market might be cooling faster than a pumpkin spice latte in December.

# The Fed Factor

The Fed is teetering on the edge of a rate cut, with markets betting that a quarter-point reduction is a done deal, and a half-point cut could be on the table if Friday's report looks dicey. With rates currently at their highest in 23 years, the central bank may need to act fast to avoid the “R” word—recession. (We hate to say it, too.)

Giacomo Santangelo, economist at Monster, sums it up: ""The labor market is cooling, but the Fed’s next move depends on how chilly things get on Friday.""

# Jobs Data Drama

July was a wake-up call, with payroll growth dragging and the private sector adding just 99,000 jobs in August—its weakest performance since 2021, according to ADP. Companies are cutting back on hiring faster than a Hollywood script rewrite, but layoffs haven’t surged… yet.

The big question: How long can businesses play defense with hiring freezes before they hit the layoff button? Tech firms are already feeling the squeeze, accounting for over half of August’s 75,891 job cuts, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. AI isn’t helping either—it’s cutting into nearly 6,000 of those tech jobs.

# What to Watch

Alongside job gains and unemployment, economists will be eyeing several indicators in Friday’s report:

* **Hours worked**: Average workweek hours fell slightly in July, and a further dip could signal reduced demand.
* **Labor force participation**: More people jumping back into the job market could mean optimism—or a higher unemployment rate.
* **Temporary layoffs**: July saw a jump in temp layoffs, largely due to auto industry retooling. If those turn permanent, buckle up.



# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s the moment of truth: the US jobs report is dropping, giving us a pulse check on the labor market. This data-packed report pulls info from all over and delivers the clearest view of employment in the country.

Last month, it didn’t go so well. July’s report showed only 114,000 jobs added, far below expectations, which sent the stock market into a nosedive. The concern? That the Fed might not have enough ammo to fend off a downturn.

For August, the forecast is looking a bit brighter—economists expect 161,000 new jobs and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. If the numbers fall short again, brace for another market slide. The silver lining? Bad news could nudge the Fed to go bigger with rate cuts next month.

# Before Market Open:

* **Big Lots** ($BIG) has had a brutal 2024, with shares cratering by over 90%. The issue? It’s not just consumers tightening their wallets—it’s liquidity. The company is flirting with bankruptcy, and given its ongoing unprofitability, paying off debt looks like a distant dream. Despite the idea that budget retailers should thrive in economic slumps, Big Lots is proving that theory wrong. With analysts predicting a -$3.46 EPS and revenue around $1.04 billion, it seems like a comeback isn’t on the horizon anytime soon.",1725580103,831271,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,8ea9fa2b8ae8b1e875bbf6720c7046d1da176a10a618c890793a574ce64c2532,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1fa176t/stock_market_today_09052024_verizon_to_acquire/

2975,"September is For The Bears… 9/6/24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","I apologize for not having a daily TA out yesterday. We unfortunately had a family crisis arise. As many of you know we decided to foster twin newborns. Well the one twin continues to be stable in the NICU and the other twin had come to use with a viral infection. Despite one hospitalization the twin at home continued to get worse until he finally got to a point yesterday I had to take him to the ER. He ended up getting admitted to the hospital where we are likely facing a multi-day minimum stay. I decided to stay with him over night and through this morning. We had about 10 different consults/ specialties look at him trying to figure out what is going on. We are making progress and he is resting comfortably now but we continue left with no answer on what is wrong with him or what the long term fix will be. I will do my best while he is there to be present but to give me wife a break from staying up there 24/7 next week I will have a few days/ times where I am not able to trade or doing my normal TA. I apologize but family always comes first!

Now on to the TA!

https://preview.redd.it/ghvggfj9x8nd1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=81bbb904768abd006f575bf4035942856513a3cd

I want to start with a perspective here, while yes the last two months have seem incredibly bearish and at times have felt like the next bear market is coming… I do find it important to remind people that major 2% down days and even 5-10% corrections are healthy and even normal.

https://preview.redd.it/sntx8rw9x8nd1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=c503664473b6f1224513b4f3747b8fac63db3b54

However, with that being said this is quite a rough beginning of September and the month for bulls…

https://preview.redd.it/0jjreh6ax8nd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cbf7fceb52e5a750218a0aebec0064a865fc7af

If you guys were sick of market moving data just know its not over yet… this week brings us another CPI reading. Now with UE lower than previous today and the fed pretty much set to cut next week while this CPI is of course important I don’t really for see this one as major/ critical as the last reading was… generally unless we get a major upside miss which based on the projected 2.6% and standard deviation CPI YoY will come in lower than previous regardless.

https://preview.redd.it/uwmhflkax8nd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2e31bde9831c5783f1e3e33747489d5e06c91cb

After this mornings jobs report markets pulled back from their expectations of a 50bps cut to now expecting a 25bps cut. While I have been saying outside of something breaking I don’t think a 50bps cut is likely to happen (even if it should)… the market finally seems to agree and has price things in correctly. This is where I was saying above with CPI that I don’t really see this one being as market moving as all this one is going to do is reconfirm that we are going to get a rate cut the following week at FOMC. Now I do see a possible scenario where we could get an exceptionally good CPI reading of 2.4% and that could spark some chatter of a 50bps back on the table… however, with UE coming back down slightly this morning I don’t think a 50bps cut is realistic at all. But we shall see what this crazy market has in store… the next two weeks likely remain extremely volatile.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/3qing6yax8nd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=25f5bf0b9181b3c859dc3985c50e3f0980757a3b

From a weekly perspective the one thing I wasn’t sure on last week was where we were headed… like I had said TECH continued to be weak and continued to show a downside case, but ES/ SPY continued to push us higher… it would appear that finally we are seeing the whole market roll over. With this new supply just below previous ATH we have established our resistance at 563.75.

Now one could argue that we are in a major range since about June with support at 532.86 and resistance at 563.75. Truly I think that is a decently valid argument. However, when you zoom out we have to consider the fact that we continue to have the EMAs trending upward AND we do NOT have weekly sellers here on SPY. I would generally need to see a closure below 532.86 with weekly sellers next week to feel like the rest of September is a down month. If this range is to hold I could see a retest and bounce off 532.86 before closing out some sort of weekly doji/ double bottom which setups the recovery rally into EOM.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 563.75  
Demand- 495.03 -> 532.86

**ES FUTURES WEEKLY**

Now on ES here this is one heck of an impressive weekly candle moving an incredibly 260pts from high to low… this formed a perfect double top rejection off of last weeks candle and established a new weekly supply at 5657. I do find it telling that markets for three weeks were so close to touching ATHs and failed to do so…

With this closure under weekly 8ema and the fight for the weekly 20ema raging on now… we again are left without a clear cut macro direction. In general our range is 5356 to 5657.

I would much like SPY need to see a weekly close under 5356 with weekly sellers to believe in a retest of the weekly 50ema support near 5121. However, there is a very good chance that bulls much like a few weeks ago will close out a doji/ double bottom here after testing 5356 to start the recovery back to rang resistance near 5657.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5657  
Demand- 5000 -> 5356

**QQQ WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/472dzaybx8nd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=30857e87e3948c02d8395ee03fa8dc9d1026cc6c

Now as we flip over to QQQ this is truly what I have been watching for the last month or so to gauge the macro picture… I know there is the age old argument about does QQQ lead SPY or does SPY lead QQQ but in my opinion and experience anytime SPY and QQQ diverge it is only a matter of time before SPY reconciles to QQQs trend. We saw that play out this week with the major SPY/ ES sell off too.

Here on QQQ we also got a new supply at 480. Now I find this new supply and price action even more important than that of SPY because it shows that the market has officially established a lower high for resistance. With this move here we could possibly be seeing the start of a downtrend. IF you look at the red line there that is the red bull channel for tech that dates back to September 2022. This is starting to form a beautiful diamond. This is one of my favorite patterns to trade as it leads to an explosive move one way or another… this is a solid chance that we continue to consolidate here inside the yellow bear channel resistance and red bull channel support though for a week or two longer… that takes us to FOMC…

Overal here what im watching for bearish confirmation would be a closure under minimally 433.16 next week. This would close us under the weekly 50ema support and would close us under the bull channel support line. That would likely setup a visit of at least 414.4 if not 396.71.

For the bulls to salvage this sell off here they need to close minimally back over the weekly 20ema resistance of 460.77 but ideally over weekly 8ema resistance of 466.04.

QQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 480 -> 496.33  
Demand- 414.4 -> 448.92

**NQ FUTURES WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/68qusnccx8nd1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=acd05b0d42b46dce11edb14b43e739ec047e3312

NQ is actually the most interesting and honestly the most bearish chart here… the reason being is that of the four charts NQ is the only one that actually has weekly sellers… not only that but as you can see besides a new supply at 19781 we also closed below the previous weekly demand/ support of 18502. This perfectly plays out the fact that we are closing lower highs and also (at least on NQ) closing lower lows too… this plays into the yellow bear channel that you can see there and plays perfectly into our triangle here too.

In general though NQ also needs to close below the red bull channel support and weekly 50ema support of 17770 to confirm this is the start of a major downward move.

However, bulls minimally need to recover over the weekly 20ema resistance of 19035 but ideally over 19225 to attempt any sort of recovery.

NQ FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 19791 -> 20588  
Demand- 17176 -> 18502

I was still at the hospital this morning when the market opened and unfortunately I couldn’t help myself… I found myself trading despite knowing I probably shouldn’t trade from mobile. I ended up with this extra range and volatility getting chopped up on my first three trades… I was able to catch the downtrend that formed and play two trades to get back two of my three accounts to green and profits. I made a massive mistake after that as I was watching my charts and entered a trade from my chart not from the trade window on ninja mobile. I didn’t realize that if you enter from the chart not the trade window that it doesn’t put your brackets on… well little did I know I would enter right before the massive 100+ pt 11am wick… thankfully despite ending up down almost 3k my account had enough drawdown to survive it. I ended up being forced to just see it through and thank goodness it was a fake move and I closed out for a small win as soon as I could. As nice as it was to be green again this was not the way I woulda like to have done it on the last account. It was nice to go back to trading strictly price action without all my fancy indicators though…

In the end despite only a 4 day trading week I was able to turn out a great week in all four of my accounts. I just need to vibe into Friday next week to hit my 14 calendar days and I will pull out another payout.

Overall it is so nice to finally be back on a good path for not only myself but for you guys too.",1725653339,831290,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,fe9e67b99c411ef1d8cc4526a2639b67ad52b6be379095fba909720ad3768bd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1faookq/september_is_for_the_bears_9624_spy_es_futures/

2978,EMP Metals (EMPS.c) Reports Progress in Lithium Exploration with Vertical Well Success and Innovative Horizontal Drilling at Viewfield Project,"EMP Metals Corp. (TSXV: EMPS.c, OTC: EMPPF), a Canadian lithium exploration and development firm, recently reported significant advancements in its summer drilling activities at the Viewfield Project, located in Saskatchewan.



Focused on large-scale lithium resources using Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE), EMP Metals continues to make strides in expanding its lithium resource base. The company controls 196,000 net acres of Subsurface Dispositions and multiple strategic wellbores in Southern Saskatchewan. 

https://preview.redd.it/va1re2mhs9nd1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=db68f3c72820338420ed6b0df2ccec2da348580e

Key updates from the recent press release include: 



**- Vertical Well Completion:**

  - EMP Metals successfully completed its first vertical test well in the northern part of the Viewfield Project.

  - The well was drilled to confirm lithium concentrations and study the characteristics of the reservoir.

  - Approximately 72 meters of core were extracted to assess the formation's permeability and porosity.



**- Strategic Data Collection:**

  - Brine sampling is underway, and core samples have been sent to Calgary for analysis, with full results expected within two months.

  - Data from core samples and brine testing will be crucial for EMP Metals to enhance its geological model and correlate findings across its large land holdings.



**- Horizontal Well Drilling:**

  - In a groundbreaking move, EMP Metals has initiated its first horizontal well targeting the Duperow formation.

  - The horizontal well, considered one of the first for lithium brine extraction in Saskatchewan—and potentially North America—features two parallel one-mile horizontal legs.

  - This design aims to achieve an initial flow rate of 1,000 cubic meters per day, with extended testing to monitor flow rates and pressure.

  - Paul Schubach, COO of EMP Metals, expressed optimism about the horizontal well's potential to enhance lithium recovery. He highlighted that horizontal drilling may offer improved flow rates and lithium concentration control over traditional vertical wells.



**- Next Steps:**

  - The drilling of the horizontal well is expected to be completed within the next seven days.

  - Following this, the site will be prepared for flow testing.

  - Initial results from the vertical well’s brine sampling are anticipated in the coming weeks, with further updates to follow.

2980,"Stock Market Today 09/06/2024: August Jobs Report - Not Great, Not Terrible + Selena Gomez Joins the Billionaire Club","# MARKETS 

* US stocks tumbled on Friday, wrapping up a turbulent week as investors reacted to a mixed August jobs report. The tech sector took the hardest hit, with the Nasdaq falling over 2.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones slipped 1.7% and 1%, respectively. The S&P 500 recorded its worst week since March, largely driven by a selloff in leading technology stocks.
* The labor data showed the U.S. added 142,000 jobs in August—an improvement from July but still below expectations. This uncertainty did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a significant rate cut later this month, leaving investors on edge as Treasury yields hit their lowest level of the year.

# August Jobs Report: Not Great, Not Terrible

It looks like the Fed has some tough choices to make after August’s jobs report hit with a “meh” response. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs—better than July’s nerve-wracking numbers but not the blowout people were hoping for. The unemployment rate also dipped a little to 4.2%, which might calm some nerves but doesn’t answer the big question: Will the Fed cut rates by a quarter-point or go bold with a half-point?

# What Happened?

The Fed’s been itching to cut rates, especially after June and July’s job growth took a nosedive. But Friday’s report was like a Goldilocks situation—not too hot, not too cold. The headline numbers weren’t weak enough to scream “emergency,” but downward revisions to the summer months suggest things aren’t looking as strong as they seemed.

Here’s what we know:

* **Job growth**: 142,000 in August, following revised numbers from June and July, which showed 86,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
* **Unemployment**: A modest dip to 4.2%.
* **Wage growth**: Hourly earnings ticked up 3.8% year-over-year, a small silver lining for workers.

# Fed's Dilemma: 25 or 50?

With the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 18, central bankers are torn between two options:

* **The safe bet**: Cut rates by 25 basis points to keep things steady and avoid rocking the boat.
* **The bold move**: Go for a 50 basis point cut to really send a message and juice the economy. Some argue that the summer hiring slowdown justifies this.

So, what’s the vibe on Wall Street? Uncertainty. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7% on Friday, marking its worst week in 18 months. The bond market also reacted with 10-year Treasury yields dipping to their lowest point in over a year.

# Fed Speak

Fed Governor Christopher Waller hinted that a sequence of cuts is likely but didn’t give a clear signal on whether they’ll go for the big 50 basis point cut just yet. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams remained non-committal, saying he didn’t have a firm view on the size of the cut.

In short, the Fed’s in a wait-and-see mode, leaving markets jittery heading into September.

# What’s Next?

While August’s job report wasn’t a disaster, it didn’t exactly boost confidence, either. Economists are now looking ahead to see if the Fed will play it safe with a smaller cut or go for a bigger move to jumpstart the economy. Whatever happens, it’s going to keep markets on their toes.

# Selena Gomez Joins the Billionaire Club

Selena Gomez has officially entered the billionaire club, and it's not from breaking records on the Billboard charts. Her beauty brand, Rare Beauty, has turned the 32-year-old actress, singer, and entrepreneur into one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the U.S., with a fortune of $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg. But don’t be fooled—this success story goes way beyond a pop star simply slapping her name on some lip gloss.

# The Rare Billionaire Formula

The vast bulk of Selena's wealth—around $1.1 billion—comes from her 51% stake in Rare Beauty, the makeup line she launched in 2020. It’s a brand that hit big with influencers and Gen Z, generating $350 million in revenue last year. Rare Beauty isn't just another celeb-founded brand; it’s become a beauty powerhouse, outshining competitors like Jessica Alba’s Honest Co. and Lady Gaga’s Haus Labs. What makes it stand out? For starters, Selena marketed it as affordable, high-quality, and inclusive, with a message that celebrates authenticity. No wonder it’s selling out faster than her concert tickets.

But it’s not all about making bank. Rare Beauty donates 1% of its sales to the Rare Impact Fund, which aims to raise $100 million over the next decade to support mental health services. The fund is deeply personal to Gomez, who has been candid about her own struggles with bipolar disorder. This combination of purpose-driven business and beauty innovation has not only cemented Rare Beauty’s place in the market but also earned Gomez a loyal customer base.

# Diversifying Her Empire

While Rare Beauty is the crown jewel of her portfolio, Selena is far from a one-trick pony. She’s got her hands in several pots, and it’s paying off big time. Her mental health startup, Wondermind, which she co-founded with her mom and Daniella Pierson of *The Newsette*, was valued at $100 million in 2022. It’s backed by investors like Sequoia Capital and Serena Williams’s venture fund. Wondermind is all about providing accessible mental health tools and resources, and it fits neatly into Selena’s broader mission of mental health advocacy.

Then there’s her acting career, which is booming. Selena stars alongside comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short in *Only Murders in the Building*, raking in at least $6 million per season. The Hulu hit just kicked off its fourth season, and Selena’s performance as the quirky, mysterious Mabel Mora has earned her an Emmy nomination. While she may have started her career as a Disney darling, Selena’s acting chops and producing gigs (she’s also an executive producer on the show) are proving she’s got serious staying power in Hollywood.

# Brand Partnerships and Social Media Power

When Selena’s not in front of the camera or overseeing Rare Beauty, she’s leveraging her massive social media following—424 million Instagram followers, making her the third most followed person on the platform, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. That digital clout has scored her major brand deals. She inked a $30 million deal with Puma and a $10 million contract with Coach. These partnerships, combined with her music royalties and acting roles, have only added to her ever-growing fortune.

What’s fascinating is that while Selena’s music career helped launch her into the public eye, it’s not a major source of her wealth. Unlike her friend Taylor Swift, who owns much of her songwriting catalog, Selena’s music earnings come primarily from performance royalties. Her last tour was back in 2016, and while it raked in $30 million, music accounts for less than 5% of her total net worth. Smart move? Absolutely. Selena has built a diversified empire that isn’t tied to the volatile ups and downs of the music industry.

# Building a Legacy

So, what’s next for Selena? For now, she’s keeping her focus on acting and business, hinting that while she might have one more album in her, her passion lies elsewhere. “I would probably choose acting,” she revealed on a recent episode of the *SmartLess* podcast. She’s also expanding her empire into new projects, including executive producing a reboot of her Disney Channel hit *Wizards of Waverly Place*.

And let’s not forget the potential growth of Rare Beauty. While Selena has fielded offers to sell the brand, including a reported $2 billion valuation, she’s publicly said she has no plans to let go of her beauty baby anytime soon. Given Rare’s rapid rise and staying power, she might be right to hold on and ride the wave.

Selena’s success isn’t just a stroke of good luck—it’s a carefully crafted blend of talent, business savvy, and authenticity. She’s created multiple revenue streams, invested in long-term ventures, and built a brand that resonates deeply with her fans. At just 32, she’s already established herself as a mogul in the beauty industry and beyond.

# The Rare Takeaway

Selena Gomez’s ascent to billionaire status is proof that being a multi-hyphenate pays off—literally. While her journey started as a child star on *Barney & Friends* and Disney’s *Wizards of Waverly Place*, she’s grown into a force to be reckoned with, using her platform to not only build a fortune but to also promote causes she cares deeply about. Rare Beauty is much more than a makeup brand; it’s a testament to her vision, resilience, and commitment to being authentic, both on and off the screen.

Her next chapter? Whatever it is, it’s sure to be *rare* and profitable.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week’s lineup is looking pretty light, but there’s one report that’s got everyone buzzing.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) drops, and it’s a big one. CPI is the go-to inflation gauge, and whatever it shows could nudge the Federal Reserve toward its next move. Last month, inflation rose 2.9% over the past year—the smallest jump since March 2021. If the cooling trend continues, it’ll give the Fed even more reason to consider cutting rates later this month.

And while earnings season is wrapping up, there are still a few stragglers worth watching. Keep your eyes peeled.

**Tuesday:** GameStop ($GME), Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY), Petco Health & Wellness ($WOOF)

2989,"HOVR's Impressive Gains Continue, Is More Bullishness on the Horizon?","Good morning, everyone! I hope you had a restful and recharging weekend. **Communicated disclaimer, nfa.**

HOVR had a stellar day, crossing the $1 mark in after-hours trading, boasting an 8% gain on the day. A lot of this momentum could be attributed to the recent news headline, *""Horizon Aircraft Positioned for Increased Investment as a Small-Cap Stock with its Disruptive Aerospace Technology.""*

Now, while we did hit an intraday high of $1.03, it was short-lived, so I'm not counting it as a proper target hit just yet. Nevertheless, the movement was strong, and I’m confident that we could see both $1.03 and $1.09 targets hit in the next few sessions—especially if we see another 200k+ volume day. That would likely bring in further bullish momentum.

# Let’s revisit the targets:

1. **$1.03**
2. **$1.09**
3. **$1.14**
4. **$1.29+**

Here’s a quick summary of some key technicals from the other day, which are still holding strong:

**Top Findings:**

* **Lots of support** around the $0.84 to $0.89 range.
* **Historical support** between $0.62 and $0.75.
* Resistance is at $1.05, but a breakout above that could take us to $1.14+ easily.
* The 9EMA and 21EMA have crossed bullish and remain strong.
* Volume upticks are signaling that a bigger move may be around the corner.
* My algo flipped bullish as of July 25th, which has been quite reliable so far.

# Interesting Info:

* **Military Partnerships**: Securing a U.S. Air Force contract shows the level of trust in the tech and opens doors for further defense contracts.
* **Prototype Success**: The hover tests of the Cavorite X7 prototype show great promise for Horizon's development pipeline.
* **Patented Tech**: HOVR’s fan-in-wing design is a game-changer in the eVTOL space, offering a competitive edge in efficiency and versatility.

In conclusion, I’m still very bullish on HOVR, and I’m thrilled to see the price action last week. Let me know what you think in the comments—cheers!

2990,2nd week of September Watchlist - Catching $LCID and $PAUIF bottoms,"Good morning, everyone! I have been seeing a lot of bots on this sub recently, and it's honestly pretty comical. Besides the point, I have two tickers that have caught my attention from a TA perspective, and they both made recent moves from their bottoms trending upward at the moment. Below is some of my DD on the price action and the price targets I have for both. Pull up the charts and see for yourself! Let’s dive in! 

First up we got $PAUIF Currently sitting at a price of $1.13. $PAUIF rocketed 112% in February, but has lost all of its gains since then. Analysis:

* Trend: Downtrend over the last 6 months, though signs of weakening which is a great reversal signal.
* MACD: Bullish crossover suggests a potential reversal as well.
* Price Action: Testing resistance around $1.20; if it breaks, a move toward $1.40 is possible. Failure could see it drop to retest $1.00.

Price Targets

* $1.36 - 20%
* $1.51 - 33%
* $1.78 - 56%

Now onto $LCID

* Trend: The stock is in a long-term downtrend. However, the price is currently above the 200-day moving average, which is a great sign.
* MACD: The MACD is in a bearish crossover above zero, which signals a potential weakening momentum after a recent attempt to rise.
* Support: Immediate support appears around $3.50, close to the current price. The 200 is also acting as support now too.
* Resistance: Resistance levels are near $3.72 and stronger around $4.00.

Price Targets

* $4.00 - 11%
* $4.82 - 32%
* $5.28 - 45%

Marjorie Taylor Greene, an American far-right politician, businesswoman, and conspiracy theorist is not only a questionable human being but also a very questionable trader. Unlike the stock trading queen Nancy Pelosi, Greene is not one to follow when it comes to stock trading - at least not according to her history.

In July, Greene bought AMAT at $219 per share. The stock has since dropped by 20%.  
She also bought NVDA in August and since then that stock is down 20%. She also invested in INTC in August, and the stock has dropped by 12% since then.

* Tech stocks, last week’s biggest losers, led Monday's rebound, with all 11 S&P sectors in the green. Wednesday’s consumer inflation report and Thursday’s producer-price numbers are the next big hurdles, as Wall Street bets on a dovish move from the Fed.

# Glowtime Unveiled — Apple’s Big Event Recap

Apple’s ""It’s Glowtime"" event has come and gone, leaving us with some shiny (slightly same) new toys to obsess over. The iPhone 16 lineup took the spotlight, with a slew of features that scream AI-powered future. Let’s dive into the highlights.

**iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Pro Max:** The iPhone 16 lineup stole the show, featuring generative AI capabilities and the new Camera Control button, which lets you snap photos, perform searches, and identify objects in real-time using Apple’s Visual Intelligence. The Pro models (6.3"" and 6.9"") come with bigger screens, thinner bezels, a faster A18 chip, and improved battery life. Both the Pro and Pro Max now let you shoot 4K video at 120 fps, ideal for cinematic slow-motion shots. The iPhone 16 models start at $799 and are available for pre-order starting Friday, with a September 20 launch.

**AirPods 4 & AirPods Max:** Apple introduced the AirPods 4 in two versions: a standard model at $129 and a higher-end version at $179 that includes active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency mode. The charging case is smaller and supports USB-C. Plus, there’s an updated AirPods Max, now with USB-C charging and some fresh colors. Both models aim for a more comfortable fit with refined contours and better sound quality.

**Apple Watch Series 10:** The 10th-generation Apple Watch is the thinnest and lightest yet, with a 40% brighter display and larger screen sizes (42mm and 46mm). It also comes packed with new features, including sleep apnea detection (pending FDA approval), and it can charge up to 80% in just 30 minutes. The Series 10 starts at $399 and is available for pre-order, with a release on September 20.

**Faster MagSafe Charger:** Apple revealed a new, more powerful 25W MagSafe charger compatible with all iPhones and Qi2 devices. Only the iPhone 16 models, however, support the full 25W charging rate, giving Apple an edge over competitors like Samsung and Google.

**iOS 18:** Launching next week, iOS 18 brings exciting updates like homescreen and lockscreen customizations, a redesigned Control Center, and satellite messaging. It also introduces a new password management app and revamped Photos and Mail apps.

Apple’s “It’s Glowtime” event brought some cool updates, but it still left many consumers wanting more. While the iPhone 16 lineup added a flashy Camera Control button and a few AI tricks, the overall design and features feel like minor tweaks compared to last year’s models. Even the Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4 saw incremental upgrades, with the usual improvements in size, battery life, and sound. Sure, the new tech is nice, but nothing felt truly groundbreaking—leaving Apple fans wondering when the next big leap is coming.

# Market Movements

* ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"" Sequel Earns $110M in U.S. Box Office: Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD)’s Beetlejuice sequel earned $110M in ticket sales during its opening weekend, making it the second-highest September debut after 2017’s It.

# OnlyFans — The Platform That Prints Money

OnlyFans—the platform you pretend to only vaguely know about—continues its rocket-ship trajectory with stunning financial figures revealed on Friday. Turns out, the adult content giant is still raking in big bucks post-pandemic.

Here’s the rundown:

* **Revenue Boom:** OnlyFans saw a 20% increase in revenue for the fiscal year ending November 2023, pulling in a cool $1.3 billion. Pre-tax profits? Up 25% to $658 million, making it one of the most profitable digital platforms around.
* **User Growth:** The platform added 4.1 million creators and 305 million users in 2023, each figure jumping by about 30%. Those users spent a whopping $6.6 billion on content, reinforcing OnlyFans' dominance in the creator economy.
* **Owner Payday:** Leonid Radvinsky, the man behind the platform, pocketed $472 million in dividends last year, bringing his total take-home to over $1 billion since 2020. The company’s founder continues to cash in as the platform’s growth shows no signs of slowing down.

**What’s driving all this?** OnlyFans lets creators sell videos, photos, and private messages via subscriptions or one-time fees. The platform skims 20% off the top, making it a wildly lucrative model for both creators and the company. Non-subscription earnings are now the biggest revenue driver, thanks to tips and pay-per-view content.

And it's not just about adult content anymore. OnlyFans is branching out with fitness, music, and comedy, turning itself into a broader digital creator hub. With record user and creator numbers, the platform is solidifying itself as a cornerstone of the creator economy while making its owner very, very wealthy.

# Oracle’s Cloud-Driven Earnings

Oracle had a big win this week, with shares surging 8.94% in after-hours trading on Monday after the company posted impressive quarterly results and announced a major new partnership. Thanks to its aggressive cloud expansion, Oracle is firmly in the game with cloud heavyweights like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.39 (beating the expected $1.33)
* **Revenue:** $13.3 billion (just ahead of the $13.2 billion forecast)
* **Cloud revenue:** Up 21% to $5.6 billion
* **Cloud infrastructure growth:** 45% jump to $2.2 billion
* **Remaining performance obligations (booked sales):** $99 billion

# Cloud Expansion Powers Growth

Oracle’s cloud business is firing on all cylinders, with its cloud infrastructure segment growing by a stunning 45% in the fiscal first quarter. Cloud services now make up the company's largest business, and demand is particularly strong for Oracle's generative AI solutions. The company has been signing up big-name customers like Elon Musk’s xAI and Reka, driving demand for AI-driven workloads.

Oracle isn’t stopping there. On Monday, it announced a major new agreement to bring its database services to Amazon Web Services (AWS), adding to previous partnerships with Microsoft and Google. Analysts view this move as a significant step in modernizing Oracle’s database business, which has traditionally been on-premise. CEO Safra Catz emphasized how these deals are helping Oracle solidify its place in the competitive cloud market.

# Big Investments, Bigger Growth Ahead

Looking ahead, Safra Catz predicts even bigger growth, forecasting double-digit revenue increases for the fiscal year ending in May 2025. To support this growth, Oracle is doubling down on cloud infrastructure, with capital expenditureshitting $2.3 billion in the last quarter and plans to double that investment by next year to keep up with demand for cloud servers.

Oracle is also expanding its global footprint, with 162 data centers in operation or under construction worldwide. The company is racing to meet the growing need for cloud infrastructure, especially for AI workloads, and its investments in this space are expected to drive continued growth.

With Oracle’s stock already up 33% this year, the company’s aggressive cloud expansion and strategic partnerships position it for long-term success. Oracle is no longer just the database giant it once was—it’s becoming a key player in the cloud and AI revolution, competing with the biggest names in tech and setting itself up for sustained growth in the years ahead.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index isn’t exactly the star of the financial show, and it doesn’t usually move markets. But with the economy under the microscope and the Fed on high alert for any slowdown signals, it’s worth keeping tabs on how small businesses—aka the backbone of the economy—are holding up.

On another note, tomorrow’s second presidential debate between former President Trump and VP Kamala Harris is likely to steal the spotlight. While it’s not market-specific, you can bet investors will be tuning in, hoping to catch a glimpse of the candidates’ economic game plans.

# Earnings:

**Tuesday:** GameStop ($GME), Dave & Buster’s ($PLAY), Petco Health & Wellness ($WOOF)

# After Market Close:

* **GameStop** ($GME) always keeps things spicy, and with another earnings report on the horizon, expect the usual rollercoaster ride. Wall Street’s take? They say the stock’s overpriced, the business model’s outdated, and it’s best to steer clear of the chaos. But retail traders have their own ideas, and if the last few years taught us anything, it’s that fundamentals go out the window with this stock. The consensus? Expect a loss of $0.08 per share on $895.67 million in revenue.",1725922963,831332,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,ae83770789d280d0641159fd3a0d8ae1315512ac6efcd2d34c4f3687cd058ab9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1fd37o1/stock_market_today_09092024_glowtime_unveiled/
2998,ADHC One crazy play here!! DD inside **MUST READ**,"I found a very interesting play thats been catching a lot attention and momentum lately. ADHC put out news today about a major acquisition thats a lot bigger than most acquisitions I’ve seen in the OTC. It’s a pennystock however, it trades like a smallcap nasdaq with a nasdaq quality team.

Based on todays news ADHC is acquiring GlucoGuard which is a AI medical device for Diabetes. The company developing the medical device is Dexcom DXCM which is a giant $27B MC company trades at $68 per share so it looks like the real deal. What makes it even more interesting is the team behind the company which includes Bill Colone.

Bill Colone has a pretty insane track record in the bio device field and still very active. He’s the current CEO of SinglePass which recently got FDA clearance in April for their Kronos biopsy closure device. 

Bill Colone also sold his first startup Endomed to LeMaitre Vascular LMAT, a giant $2B MC company.

In addition to that, Bill Colone helped position a surgical vascular graft product company IMPRA Inc which later was acquired by CR Bard for $143M. Bill was Director of Operations of IMPRA for 11 years.

Now Bill Colone is working with ADHC a tiny little pennystock with a market cap of $3.7M. He recently joined ADHC advisory board on June of this year. 

Today, ADHC released news that they’re acquiring GlucoGuard. Bill Colone added, ""Hypoglycemia, particularly during sleep, is a persistent and dangerous issue for diabetic patients, often leading to serious consequences like the dreaded 'Death in Bed' syndrome. GlucoGuard's technology offers a game-changing solution to this pressing problem."" 

 “In addition to the acquisition, GlucoGuard's founder, Zachary Smith, BS/MS Biomedical Engineering (Arizona State University), will join ADHC's advisory board. Smith will work alongside Bill Colone, a renowned expert in biomedical solutions, to advance GlucoGuard's development and integration into ADHC's expanding healthcare technology portfolio.”

ADHC also had other positive news recently. 
On August 26 the company announced that they negotiated the elimination of $2.7M in debt from their balance sheet, creating a DEBT-FREE company.

Also on August 29 ADHC announced cancellation of 142 million shares bringing the total cancellation of shares to 466 million shares.

Aside from that, the stock chart looks absolutely amazing, seriously. The stock is very liquid and trades on high volume daily.

Now going back to the acquisition which is actually very interesting and the biggest catalyst of them all. 

The GlucoGuard device is a pain-free and non invasive way to detect blood sugar levels and deliver glucose when needed. 
It's the ONLY device to treat nocturnal hypoglycemia. For people that suffer from Diabetes, there is the constant issue of monitoring blood sugar levels. While low blood sugar can happen at any time during the day, many people may experience low blood sugar while they sleep. This known as ""Nocturnal Hypoglycemia"" 

GlucoGuard is an oral retainer worn while sleeping and is the only medical device designed to automatically deliver glucose when needed and reduce the risks associated with hypoglycemia. 

 Also worth mentioning the target market is absolutely huge for this device. It is estimated that 422 million people are living with Diabetes worldwide.

Overall the kicker is that this is a nasdaq quality company trading on the OTC at a 3.7 million dollar market capitalization (at the time of writing). Very interested to see how the market reacts to the news over the upcoming weeks/months.

Also would like to hear everyone else’s opinion on this stock, I will check the comment section for everyone else’s thoughts.

3001,This stock is just 11% away from its all-time high: No resistance after that…,"Morning Everyone! This stock has been discussed a fair bit in this sub over the past few weeks. I added it to my watchlist and have watched it steadily climb since August. I just wanted to point out that **$OSTX** has had a lot of positive momentum, and it shouldn’t go unnoticed. From the chart, the current price of $4.17 is close to the stock's all-time high (around $4.60). Being near the all-time high suggests the stock has approached a significant resistance level, where the price previously failed to move higher so keep that in mind.

What it means when there's no resistance beyond the all-time high

* No Historical Resistance: Once the stock breaks through its all-time high, there is no prior price data acting as resistance, meaning there's no established ceiling for future price movement.
* Potential for Strong Uptrend: In such scenarios, stocks often experience rapid upward movement because of the lack of overhead resistance. This is called price discovery, where the market finds new equilibrium levels.
* Psychological Momentum: Breaking the all-time high can trigger bullish sentiment, as many traders and algorithms often enter long positions on such breakouts, driving further price increases.

The stock could see accelerated growth if it clears the $4.60 level with strong volume since no further resistance exists to cap its rise.

3002,HOVR Sees 18x Volume and High Short Interest – Eyes on a Squeeze,"Good morning everyone! **TLDR**: I’ve got my eyes on **HOVR** for a potential squeeze.

While yesterday’s close wasn’t the best, we still saw **HOVR** rocket over **30%**, smashing all of our targets. **Communicated disclaimer**.

Unfortunately, after peaking high, it retraced quite a bit by the day’s end. But there’s some good news:

HOVR saw an **18x volume spike**—with over **4 million shares traded**—and there’s also **74% short interest** being reported. Why so much short interest? That’s the question. My theory: algo traders saw the upward momentum and triggered short trades. But that only puts us in a prime position for a potential squeeze.

On top of that, HOVR also released some great **PR** yesterday, which has only strengthened the fundamental picture. Nothing has really changed—if anything, HOVR looks more appealing now than ever.

Here’s the news for those interested: \[[link to that news/pr](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2024/09/09/2942821/0/en/Horizon-Aircraft-Begins-Full-Scale-Development-of-eVTOL-Aircraft-Accelerates-Flight-Tests-and-Expands-World-Class-Team.html)\].

In conclusion, I’m still keeping a close eye on **HOVR** for the squeeze potential. We already had a win, and I’m hopeful for more!

3003,Rockwell Medical (RMTI) – Strong performance and promisinc upside?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with Rockwell Medical Inc. ($RMTI) for those of you who are considering dipping your toes into this stock. I’ve been tracking the company for a while, and it seems like things are really starting to move. Here’s a quick snapshot of my investment and performance so far (see attached image):

	•	Total units: 1,198.83 @ $2.94
	•	Invested: $3,522.92
	•	Current value: $4,183.90
	•	Total gain: $660.98 (+18.76%)

This is clearly outperforming many of the larger pharma stocks in my portfolio, and the returns have been consistent across multiple buys:

	•	Small position at $647.79 – up 2.70% so far
	•	Medium position at $487.93 – up 9.52%
	•	Larger position at $1,487.78 – up 20.92%
	•	Final buy at $899.42 – up 31.78%

What’s interesting about RMTI is their focus on niche dialysis and iron delivery therapies, which places them in a space with strong demand and potential long-term growth as healthcare continues to evolve.

Now, this isn’t investment advice—just sharing some personal insights—but I’m curious to know if anyone else has been keeping an eye on RMTI. The price has been pretty volatile in the past, but I see a lot of upside potential here. Do any of you see it moving up further, or is it nearing a peak?

Would love to hear thoughts from other investors who are into biotech and pharma stocks!",1725974759,831371,bpbri911,t2_jaezuadds,66dd365db7138b8f715fdf0c52309d8cc67a8222399cd45a534c397c5af7a4a9,https://i.redd.it/9j1wfmo3hznd1.jpeg

3005,I found a method by which I was able to make a steady income,"Today, I want to share something interesting I recently stumbled upon while exploring new crypto strategies. I’ve been involved in the crypto world for a few years, always on the lookout for methods that actually deliver results. After diving into some discussions in a private crypto community, I came across a method that really piqued my interest. In just one day, I managed to earn close to $100 with minimal effort. It doesn’t take much time, and I quickly realized this was something worth sticking with. Essentially, we’ll be earning **0.25% per transaction** on the IOST network using their native coin.

# Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Buy USDT on the exchange and swap it for IOST on the spot market.
2. Go to your account, select **IOST**, click **Deposit**, and copy your memo.
3. Then go to the **Withdraw** section, select **IOST**, and fill in the following details:
   * Address (here, we use the developers’ test address: **blocktest**)
   * Memo (use the memo you copied earlier)
   * Network: **IOST**
4. Execute the transaction, and wait about 10 minutes. Your transaction will return with a bonus.
5. Repeat the cycle.

# Important Notes:

* Rewards are received in **IOST**, not USDT.
* The price of the coin can fluctuate, so it’s important to know when to buy and sell. For those who are holding long-term, like me, you can just accumulate IOST for future sales.
* This method works on **Binance** and **MEXC**; I’m unsure about other exchanges.
* You don’t have to follow my exact example. You can start with as little as **50 IOST** and gradually earn more—better than nothing.

Good news on 2 fronts, important for the big stockmarket cashflows and with impact on all your investments

**A.** No need for Bank of Japan rate hike in September.

https://preview.redd.it/xldiadd991od1.jpg?width=790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8ff776cc0cb0edd94155026a99f48a09fc5daa6

And with significant lower oil price, high LNG inventories in Japan and a YEN becoming more expensive compared to the USD, I expect that BoJ will not have to raise their rate in coming months, making it a less aggressive rate hike.

Next BoJ rate hike in January 2025 maybe.



**B.** A softer Basel III End game: less capital requirements for banks

3011,"Pre-CPI Day… 9-10-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Daily Market Analysis","The bulls continue their pushes higher today… there was certainly some times much like yesterday where it appeared the bears were going to take over… however, while I am not one to say manipulation… there was some clear times where things didn’t quite make sense… I am very curious how the markets will react tomorrow at 830am for CPI…

Now lets talk about CPI…

https://preview.redd.it/ajggtsksq1od1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2cac05a3e3b87beb8ea5f82ee51b44d552956f4

Here is the expected ranges in which we should see CPI print tomorrow… we have a few things to talk about here…

https://preview.redd.it/4yhjntusq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=72ce8c3921702cc07e5974770077689ce5055ae4

The first thing and arguably the most important is the fact that CPI YoY is likely to come in at 2.5 to 2.6% tomorrow… if we see CPI YoY come in at 2.5 to 2.6% this will be the lowest CPI YoY reading since April 2021 where we printed 2.6%... the biggest thing here looking at the chart is that after essentially a year of consolidation if we can see 2.5% or lower that would be the start of the next leg down likely in CPI… this would confirm the already known 25bps rate cut coming next week.

https://preview.redd.it/mc2zrx7tq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f576e5ce4d9c73fc83e9d0d6920a631d4ce5db16

Now taking a look at CORE CPI YoY which likely is to come in at 3.2%. Assuming CORE does come in 3.2% or lower it will be our lowest reading since April 2021 also. The bigger and more important trend to notice here is the fact that since Sept 2022 (a staggering 22 month decline)… If CORE happens to miss to the upside and we see a 3.3% or even 3.4% move on CORE there is a very high chance markets may panic… CORE is arguably more important than CPI YoY at times especially when it comes to rate cuts… while I think the fed is going to cut regardless I can see the market getting nervous tomorrow IF CORE rises that the fed may wait one more time… However, if CORE comes lower likely markets will just know for sure that a rate cut comes in a week.

Again the bigger question really comes though as “is it good news or bad news to confirm our first rate CUT is coming next week?”

Going to keep the TA brief as we have CPI and likely can see a big move… so we will figure out from there…

**SPY DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/8puk2tktq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a490779aac5e6030e112131033d4c9670a62e77d

Bulls broke through the daily 50ema resistance today and avoided the daily double top rejection off the 50ema.

Bulls will target a closure over 550.78 (daily 8/ 20ema resistance) to then setup a EOW move to 556.16- 558.24.

Bears will target a closure under 546.95 (daily 50ema support) to then target 540.3 and 537.11 into EOW.

**ES FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/22js4tvtq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=93806efa2ab0107c19c948cc1eb3b331f9a786ab

A bit different of a setup on ES here… we did NOT get through the daily 50ema and that actually is exactly where our HOD rejected.

Bulls need to breakout and target 5532 (daily 20ema) resistance tomorrow to setup for 5580 into EOW.

Bears will look to close under todays low of 5450 to then target 5402-5413 by EOW.

**QQQ DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/544qhi6uq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c20990e15db7ec8f7960cf64a5d93e9d889240e1

Todays and yesterdays QQQ candle show a similar failed (manipulated) breakdown…

The bulls need to breakout over 8/ 100ema resistance at 450.63. This then setups a breakout to 50ema resistance at 466.34 and demand at 470.63 by EOW.

Bears will look to reject hard off 8/ 100ema and target 448.68 demand into EOW.

**NQ FUTURES DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/65ugppguq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae683b6d9a5401fd39d5a647833353fcd4d5cee

Again a slightly different move here on NQ… we did not quite get to the daily 8ema resistance but that is where bulls will have the biggest fight at 18936.

Bulls will look to close over 100ema resistance of 19018 tomorrow to then target 50ema/ demand at 19250-19306 by EOW.

Bears must reject and close minimally under 18600 to then retest 18376 demand by EOW.

**VIX DAILY**

https://preview.redd.it/vx1h99suq1od1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e3a2563666e87f22d609923240a39d02584efd

I am somewhat unsurprised to see the VIX mostly flat today though down 2%... the thing to notice here is that the last 4 days have attempted to break below this 18.61 supply/ daily 20ema support and have failed to…

I generally struggle to be short term and long term bullish until I see a CLOSURE under 18.61 but realistically under 17.12.

Depending on how markets receive this CPI tomorrow there is potential for a bigger bounce on the VIX tomorrow… a move back to 22.39-22.67 would ideally setup a retest of our recent lows.

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

https://preview.redd.it/9q1uz55vq1od1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=de40f8c046ab50798056c6c02822e9a3a4932429

Quite the trading log today…. I officially closed out my 14^(th) green day in a row… I believe this might be my longest futures streak since I started trading strictly futures last summer. I have obviously been on quite the hot streak which has been great for my prop firms… I have netted an additional about 10k between the three accounts since my last payout… I will once again be eligible for a payout on this Friday.

Anyone who knows me knows that when its hot its hot and good but when my streaks end they can be a bit dramatic… the last two trading days have honestly not been my best work and I have felt like while I have had good reads and good results that I am getting a big over confident. I recognize that as you can see the opening of my day today that I need to tone it down a bit… I have generally been killing it but this morning I was looking at -2000 in all three of my accounts… while still allows me to take a payout that’s a -6000 day if it closed there… I was able to recoup it and honestly that’s a great thing but also took some aggressive trading…

I am going to go ahead and lock myself out of my ninja account until next Monday. I do not want to risk trading away 10k even if that means I miss out on 2-4k more before Friday (depending on how my trading went).

I opened a $300k APEX account on special and for the next three days I am just going to trade that… take a little break. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing… I can feel when I am hitting my limit and today was confirmation that its time to slow myself down before I regret it. Risk management is the key to success…",1726002256,831336,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,332e5bf3956447d7bc3154743c8ab25c5c13b977a4683bbf9f74e6c601f92dbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1fdsvfe/precpi_day_91024_spy_es_futures_and_qqq_nq/

# Google Back in the Hot Seat — The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it’s all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google’s stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads—tools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google’s Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google’s control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google’s practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They’re demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn’t the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet’s overall revenue—78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google’s Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google’s legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What’s Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google’s ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google’s ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google’s advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google’s struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# CPI Tomorrow — Inflation Data Holds the Key

This week, the Federal Reserve is set to get its final look at inflation numbers before its next policy meeting on September 18. With interest rate cuts all but certain, the key question now is: how big will the cut be? The answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reports—the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are expected to clarify the Fed’s next move, especially after Friday’s jobs report provided little guidance.

# CPI & PPI: The Deciding Factors

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August’s CPI report, followed by the PPI on Thursday. Economists are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase for both headline and core CPI, bringing annual inflation rates to 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The PPI is expected to mirror these figures. While the Fed’s preferred inflation measure is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, this week’s CPI and PPI readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut.

The debate is now centered on whether the Fed will opt for a modest 25-basis-point cut or go bigger with a 50-basis-point reduction. Futures markets currently favor a quarter-point cut, with odds hovering around 71%. However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading could push the Fed toward a more aggressive move. Economists like Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut.

# Shifting Focus: From Inflation to Jobs

While inflation has been the Fed's main concern for months, the focus is now turning toward the labor market. Hiring has slowed significantly, with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135,000 per month since April, down from 255,000 in the prior five months. Job openings have also declined, raising fears that the labor market is weakening. This shift has increased expectations that the Fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later, starting with a baby step at the next meeting.

# What’s Next?

After this week’s inflation reports, all eyes will be on the Fed’s September 18 meeting. If the data shows more progress in curbing inflation, the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut. But even if the Fed starts small, markets expect more cuts to follow, with a possible half-point reduction in November and another in December. As the Fed navigates these murky waters, the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Inflation’s about to take center stage again. Tomorrow, we get the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) report—aka, the data that shows how much more (or less) expensive life has gotten over the past year. While the Fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation, CPI is the star of the show—especially core CPI, which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices.

Economists are penciling in a 0.2% rise for August, same as July’s bump. If that holds, it would push annual inflation down from 2.9% to 2.6%. Core inflation is also expected to clock in at 3.2% year-over-year. If these numbers land as predicted, the Fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next week’s meeting.

# Apple’s $14 Billion Bite: EU Wins Big

# Apple’s Tax Drama Ends in Defeat

Apple just faced a crushing blow in its decade-long tax battle. The European Union’s top court upheld the tech giant’s €13 billion ($14.4 billion) tax bill in Ireland, a case that’s been brewing since 2016. At the heart of it, Apple was accused of getting sweetheart tax deals from Ireland—a violation of EU state-aid rules. The ruling is a major win for the EU, specifically for Margrethe Vestager, its outgoing antitrust chief, who’s spent her tenure targeting Big Tech with a vengeance.

While Apple isn’t thrilled—Tim Cook once called the whole thing “total political crap”—it’s now staring down a hefty $10 billion tax charge for its fiscal fourth quarter. Ireland, which denied giving any special treatment, must now figure out what to do with that massive windfall, currently chilling in an escrow account. With this decision, Apple’s hopes of escaping the EU’s tax net have officially fizzled.

This isn’t Apple’s first run-in with the EU. Vestager has long had the company in her crosshairs, accusing them of taking advantage of Europe’s low corporate tax rates while reaping billions in revenue. While Apple argues that it pays its fair share wherever it operates, the EU views this as a clear case of tax avoidance, and this victory sets a strong precedent. Moving forward, other Big Tech firms like Amazon may want to watch their backs as the EU sharpens its focus on leveling the tax playing field.

# Who is Vestager?

Margrethe Vestager isn’t just any bureaucrat—she’s the EU’s competition czar and a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley giants. As the European Commission's executive vice president for competition since 2014, she’s made it her mission to hold tech behemoths accountable for their market dominance and questionable tax practices. Apple, Google, Amazon—you name it, she’s probably fined them. Vestager’s nickname “Tax Lady” (courtesy of Donald Trump) reflects her relentless pursuit of fairness, particularly when it comes to leveling the playing field for European companies against global titans. Her bold approach has made her a hero in some circles and a nightmare in others, but her departure from the Commission leaves a legacy of major wins against Big Tech.

# Google’s Not Laughing Either

Not to be left out, Google also felt the sting of the EU’s iron fist. The court upheld a €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) fine against the search giant for unfairly promoting its own shopping service in search results. The penalty, originally slapped on Google in 2017, marked the beginning of a series of fines that now total more than €8 billion ($8.5 billion). Despite changes Google made years ago to appease regulators, the court's ruling reinforces the EU’s determination to keep Big Tech in check.

While Google is ""disappointed"" with the decision, the EU is riding high on its tech crackdown, hoping that the Digital Markets Act (DMA) will be the final nail in the coffin for self-preferencing. The law, passed last year, seeks to curb the dominance of giants like Google and Apple. As Vestager put it, “No one is above the law”—and it seems she’s making good on that promise.

In short, Apple’s tax break? Gone. Google’s search dominance? Under fire. The EU isn’t backing down, and this week, the Silicon Valley giants were the latest to feel the heat.

# Inflation Cools, But Core's Still Hot

The inflation train has finally hit a cooling station—kind of. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices rose just 0.2% in August, bringing the year-over-year inflation rate down to 2.5%, the lowest since early 2021. *Cue cautious optimism.* But before you start popping the champagne, core inflation (which excludes those pesky volatile items like food and energy) came in a tad higher than expected, rising 0.3%. The housing market was the main culprit here, with shelter prices climbing their fastest all year.

This means the Fed has some tough choices to make. Wall Street was hoping for a bolder 50 basis point rate cut next week, but with core inflation still sticky, traders are now betting on a more modest 25 basis point reduction. Don’t expect the Fed to let up entirely on inflation just yet—they’ll likely be playing defense for a while longer.

# What This Means for the Fed (and You)

Despite the mixed inflation signals, the market actually took the news in stride. Stocks wobbled at first but bounced back to end the day in the green, and Treasury yields remained near year-long lows. Traders are pricing in an 85% chance of a quarter-point rate cut when the Fed wraps up its meeting on September 18, with expectations for even more rate cuts through the end of the year.

But what’s the Fed’s game plan from here? Jerome Powell and company are still threading the needle between taming inflation and preventing a slowdown in the job market, which has already cooled significantly. With unemployment on the rise and wage growth slowing, the Fed has to balance its rate cuts carefully to avoid tipping the economy into a full-on recession. So, while inflation may be losing steam, the bigger question is: How low will rates go before the Fed hits pause?

# Consumer Prices: A Mixed Bag

Not all prices are following inflation’s cooling trend. Housing costs, which make up a third of the CPI, were up 0.5%, accounting for a whopping 70% of the core inflation increase. On the flip side, energy prices fell by 0.8%, while used vehicle prices dipped 1%. Medical services were down 0.1%, but don’t get too comfortable—egg prices soared 4.8%, and airline fares jumped nearly 4%.

All of this points to a mixed picture for consumers, who are still feeling the squeeze in certain areas despite overall price moderation. Real earnings rose 0.2% in August, outpacing inflation for the month, but households are still dealing with much higher prices for goods and services than before the pandemic.

So, what's next? Keep your eyes peeled for more rate cuts by year-end as the Fed continues its balancing act between inflation and economic slowdown. Oh, and maybe rethink that fall getaway—airline prices aren’t getting any cheaper.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

After checking off the Consumer Price Index, it’s time to give some love to the Producer Price Index (PPI). While CPI tells us what you’re paying at the checkout line, PPI tracks what producers are getting for their goods—basically, retail vs. wholesale inflation.

PPI rose a modest 0.1% last month, falling short of the 0.2% economists expected. On an annual scale, it slid to 2.2%, down from June’s 2.7%. Meanwhile, core PPI (excluding those pesky food and energy costs) was flat, which forecasters hope will remain the case this month.

Also, keep an eye on the weekly initial jobless claims report. With the Fed zeroing in on the labor market, this data could be key to guessing whether we’re headed toward another interest rate hike.

(Ticker: LUCA.v or LUCMF for US investors) has showcased impressive growth & operational success in recent months, highlighted by a record-breaking financial performance in Q2 2024. 



LUCA is advancing two key projects in Mexico. The Tahuehueto mine in Durango State, which is in the ramp-up phase, is expected to commission its mill by Q4 2024. With throughput expected to reach 1,000 tonnes per day, Luca anticipates producing over 30,000 gold equivalent ounces at this project in 2025. 



Meanwhile, the Campo Morado mine in Guerrero State is undergoing an optimization program that has improved recoveries and operational efficiency. Luca is ramping up mining rates to 2,000 tonnes per day at Campo Morado, targeting production over 70,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2025 at the site. 



Per its recent update, mid-tier gold equivalent producer reported a quarterly net revenue of US$18.2 million, a 49% increase over the same period in 2023. 



LUCA achieved net earnings of $4.7 million, reflecting a significant 217% year-over-year growth. Additionally, the company posted positive cash flow from operations of $739,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive cash flow.



During Q2 2024, Luca produced a total of 14,000 gold equivalent ounces, which included 4,278 ounces of gold, 188,000 ounces of silver, 3,252 tonnes of zinc, and 706 tonnes of copper. 



Operational costs, measured on an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) basis, were $1,714 per ounce at the Campo Morado mine and $1,677 per ounce at the Tahuehueto mine.

# Moderna Is Feeling A Bit Sick…

**Cost Cutting Mode**  
Moderna’s getting out the scissors. The biotech giant announced plans to cut its R&D budget by $1.1 billion over the next three years as it faces the harsh reality of slumping vaccine sales. The company is pulling the plug on five programs and slowing down late-stage trials to rein in costs. Translation: it’s aiming to survive the post-COVID world by focusing on 10 key product launches by 2027. But there’s a catch—Moderna’s break-even target just got pushed back two years, from 2026 to 2028.

**Investors to Moderna: Not Impressed**  
Wall Street took one look at that plan and said, “Nope.” Shares tanked over 12%, marking a rough day for a stock that’s already down 20% this year. While Moderna claims it’s exercising ""financial discipline"" by scaling back, investors are skeptical. They’re wondering if this is less about discipline and more about desperation. The company’s revenue projections for next year didn’t help either, coming in way below analysts' expectations. Some are questioning whether Moderna can make it to 2028 without asking for more cash from shareholders.

**So, What’s Next?**  
Moderna is betting big on 10 new products, with vaccines for flu, RSV, and a combo flu-COVID shot leading the charge. The company’s pipeline also includes some cancer treatments, but fast-tracking those approvals has hit a snag with regulators. Still, Moderna is pushing forward, expecting these new launches to drive growth. However, don’t expect any major cash infusions until at least 2025—revenue contributions from these new products are likely a couple of years away.

**The Bigger Picture**  
This isn’t just about tightening the belt. Moderna’s once high-flying COVID vaccine sales have fallen to earth, forcing the company to recalibrate. Its COVID cash cow dried up faster than expected, and competition in the vaccine space is heating up. Now, the company is left navigating a landscape that’s looking a lot less certain. CEO Stéphane Bancel insists that they won’t need to raise equity, but investors aren’t convinced.

  
Moderna’s “pivot” may sound like a savvy long-term strategy, but in the short term, it’s raising a lot of eyebrows. With revenue projections looking iffy and product launches still a few years out, the biotech darling has some convincing to do if it wants to regain Wall Street’s trust. Until then, it’s all about survival—and cutting those R&D costs is just the beginning.

# Oracle’s Big Cloud Dreams — $104 Billion Sales by 2029

Oracle has its eyes on the clouds… and a lot of cash. The software giant just upped its forecast, predicting at least $104 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029, thanks to the rapid growth of its cloud infrastructure business. This ambitious target was laid out by Executive VP Doug Kehring during Oracle’s annual analyst briefing, where the company also raised its fiscal 2026 sales outlook to $66 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.5 billion.

**Cloud Wars Heating Up**  
Oracle’s game plan? Keep expanding its cloud services to compete with the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The company has been gaining traction in cloud infrastructure, particularly with generative AI workloads, boasting high-profile clients like Elon Musk’s xAI. Oracle’s strategy also includes making its database software easier to run on rival platforms—a move it hopes will help migrate its on-premise customers to the cloud, a key pillar of its growth strategy.

**The Numbers Game**  
Oracle’s stock is having a banner year, up 55% so far, trailing only Nvidia among the tech giants. Shares jumped another 6% following the updated revenue forecast, capping off a good week that saw the stock surge 15% over three trading sessions. CEO Safra Catz was confident about hitting these targets, citing partnerships with cloud heavyweights like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to help boost Oracle’s cloud revenue, which has already grown by 45% in the latest quarter.

**Eyes on AI**  
Oracle’s not just riding the cloud wave—it’s betting big on AI, too. The company announced it’s taking orders for a massive cluster of Nvidia’s next-gen GPUs, which could solidify its place in the AI race. And as capital expenditures are set to double in fiscal 2025, Oracle’s banking on both cloud and AI to keep the revenue train rolling.

# Adobe’s AI Ambitions Stumble — Guidance Misses Mark

# By the Numbers:

* **$5.5B - $5.55B**: Adobe's revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, falling short of analysts’ $5.6B expectations.
* **8%**: Adobe’s drop in extended trading after the guidance miss.
* **11%**: Increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.41B.
* **$4.65**: Adobe’s third-quarter profit per share, beating estimates of $4.53.
* **$550M**: Net new digital media subscriptions, slightly below the $561M forecast.

Adobe has been busy rolling out AI tools like Firefly in its creative software, but investors are still waiting for that AI magic to show up in the company’s numbers. On Thursday, the software giant reported revenue for the upcoming quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations. The company expects revenue between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion, slightly below the $5.6 billion analysts had predicted. In after-hours trading, the stock dropped 8%, leaving investors unimpressed.

**Strong Results, But Not Strong Enough**  
Adobe’s third-quarter numbers weren’t bad by any stretch—sales jumped 11% to $5.41 billion, and profit topped estimates at $4.65 per share. The company’s core digital media business, which includes its AI-infused Creative Cloud, also grew 11%. However, guidance for the fourth quarter disappointed, leaving many to wonder when the much-hyped AI features will start meaningfully boosting revenue.

**AI Hype vs. Reality**  
Adobe has been aggressively adding AI capabilities to its software lineup, hoping to cash in on the generative AI trend. But investors were banking on seeing bigger results by now, and the slower-than-expected adoption of AI tools like Firefly has some worried. Competitors like Canva have already hiked prices for AI features, putting pressure on Adobe to follow suit—although such changes could take quarters, if not years, to fully materialize.

**Price Hikes and Patience**  
Adobe is looking for ways to monetize its AI features, but price increases for its software take time to roll out to all customers. Meanwhile, its key metric of net new digital media subscriptions came in at $550 million, slightly below estimates, adding to investor jitters. Despite all the hype surrounding AI, Adobe’s leadership insists the company is just scratching the surface of what these innovations can do.

**The Takeaway**  
For now, it seems Adobe’s AI-driven future is more about potential than actual results. With shares down 8% after the guidance miss, investors are growing impatient for the promised AI uplift. As the company continues to invest in generative AI, the question remains: when will it start paying off in a big way?

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, we’ll get the latest pulse on consumer sentiment with the University of Michigan’s September Survey of Consumers. While it won’t sway the Fed’s decision on interest rates, it still gives us a decent read on how people are feeling about the economy—which, let’s be honest, is always worth knowing.

On the earnings front, it’s pretty quiet. With no big reports on deck, it looks like companies are enjoying a bit of a breather—perhaps gearing up for something bigger down the line. ",1726185698,831351,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,9da026beb01d3507fd8ac9e0dbdf22192eabc505a7c9c066895bf1e1b3548de3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1ffh89s/stock_market_today_09122024_moderna_to_cut_its_rd/

3034,Should I expect a pullback after a 17% move this week?,"I know that it could keep going up if the demand is there, but I am getting nervous if I don’t lock in profits, I could lose the gains. The stock is $PAUIF and is small cap, so it is already very risky. I found them on trading view with their “analysts” saying a buy, and when I looked into the company and they have had some pretty positive catalysts which prompted me. This is a super brief summary of what I was looking at and my initial thoughts:

* Uranium Spot Price Surge: The sharp increase in uranium prices since 2023 places $PAUIF in an advantageous position to benefit from the rising demand for domestic uranium, essential for energy security.
* Strategic U.S. Uranium Assets: $PAUIF has acquired significant uranium mining projects in resource-rich areas of Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. These regions have a proven history of uranium production, enhancing the company's growth potential.
* Exploration Drill Initiatives: The company's recent announcement of a $2.3 million budget for exploratory drilling in Wyoming highlights its commitment to expanding its uranium portfolio, which could lead to significant discoveries and higher valuation.
* Experienced Leadership Team: $PAUIF boasts a leadership team with over 100 years of combined experience in uranium and mining. Their expertise enhances the company’s ability to navigate market challenges and capitalize on opportunities within the uranium sector.
* Potential NASDAQ Listing: With share prices stabilizing and a notable increase in earnings per share (EPS), $PAUIF could soon meet the requirements for a NASDAQ listing, which would increase visibility and attract more institutional investors.

I know this is super risky already, but I'm expecting some sort of pullback in the short term. but in the long term this doesn’t look half bad. Let me know what you think!

3035,"Bulls Close Out a Perfect Week… 9-13-24 SPY/ ES Futures, and QQQ/ NQ Futures Weekly Market Analysis","With markets coming off the worst week since March of 2023 one would have thought that downside was the most probable scenario. However, the markets were waiting for CPI which inevitably moved the markets higher. While on paper this is a bullish week and recovery watching the intraday price action for this week was far from bullish. This is the first week in a very long time with everyday seeing some sort of weird rogue wicks. It certainly made for some difficult price action to trade.

The markets will now set its sites on FOMC and the expectation of our first rate cut since the fed started raising rates over 2 years ago.

https://preview.redd.it/y1folx91vmod1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6daac687d4dbcc58ee97431979fe9afcaac3011a

I am somewhat surprised here that the market has repriced in higher odds for a 50bps cut. I just don’t see JPOW jumping head first in with a 50bps cut… that will be something to watch Monday and Tuesday.

**SPY WEEKLY**

https://preview.redd.it/z3v8y7l1vmod1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=77440d2496f285fcaaff24988fa1e4d2c0d13fd2

Honestly last week with the pretty impressive drop I was leaning more heavily towards downside and perhaps the retest of 532.86 demand. However, the bulls clearly won this week with a new demand/ support at 540.32 and also the return of stronger weekly buyers.

Generally speaking since the middle of June though we have just been chopping in the same 432.86 to 563.75 range. While I don’t see a real reason to be bearish here from a technical stand point.. I do think it is of note that we did NOT close over 563.75 which means there is a potential for the range/ lower highs trend to continue.

Bulls will look to close over 563.75 next week to then seek out ATHs and the next major target of 570.

Bears need to double top reject off 563.75 supply and target a move back to 8eam support near 551.52.

SPY WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 563.75

ES also found a major bounce off the weekly 20ema support which also puts in a new demand/ support at 5403. This gives us a pretty strong weekly double demand/ support area near 5356-5403. With the support of buyers here one has to assume bulls will target a breakout and closure over 5657 supply/ range resistance next week.

While I continue to struggle to find a technical basis to be bearish here… bulls still need to close a higher high on the weekly (and daily) timeframe to truly breakout here with a target being 5750.

Bears will need to double top and move back to the weekly 8ema support near 5541.

ES FUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS  
Supply- 5657  
Demand- 5356 -> 5403

**QQQ WEEKLY**

QQQ also remains in a range since the middle of may with support being 448.67 and resistance being 496.33. What I find really interesting is the fact that we have reconfirmed previous weekly demand of 448.67. Which means that on two separate occasions now markets have confirmed the exact same weekly level as demand/ support. We also did see the return of weekly buyers here too.

Much like ES/ SPY though we did NOT get a higher high close on the weekly yet. The bulls must close minimally over 480 but ideally over 496.33 in order to confirm a breakout of the range.

Bears will look to hold 480 supply/ resistance and retest weekly 20ema support near 462.15.

QQQ WEEKYL LEVELS  
Supply- 480 ->496.33  
Demand- 448.67

Shifting over to NQ here this is the only chart of the three that did NOT see stronger weekly buyers return to the market… however, we have a matching 18377 demand/ support put in. Uniquely here is that this is not a reconfirmation of a demand as previous demand/ support was at 18500. However, you can see last weeks candle low and the low body of 8/5 weekly are the exact same. In general here our range has been 18377 to 20588.

Bulls must breakout over 19781 to then target 20588.

Bears will look to continue the lower highs and target a drop back to 19075 the weekly 20ema support.

The one thing I absolutely love about MyFundedFutures (amongst other things) is that I can request a payout and see that payout paid the same day… I don’t know many other props that do that…

I was hoping my payouts could be process this morning and that I wouldn’t have to wait until EOD but thankfully I did not. That allowed me to jump back into trading.

I had a pretty great and early start to two of my three accounts. Unfortunately I got wicked out a few times at BE and also at a full loss on my 3^(rd) account. However, I was able to fight back and end up still closing out a nice green day in all three accounts. From -1200 to +300 is not a bad day… starting all three accounts back off with 14 trading days to go with +1200.

Looking forward to the weekend to relax and start fresh Monday.

It is kind of funny… two years ago my wife asked me “why don’t you just trade the first hour and be done for the day” I really didn’t have a great answer for her as to why I wouldn’t stop outside of I had a server where I felt like I had to be all day trading regardless… However, I will say making the change to only trade till 11am and a hard set fast rule of once green im done and walk away (physically leave my desk) for the day has honestly been the best thing I have ever done for my trading. From both a mental, emotional and physical stand point it has been incredibly beneficial and rewarding.",1726257924,831357,DaddyDersch,t2_6piw14v8,442f302735162ed4e1aeb8637e4ca45390d92eb7b19f748ce831e0390257fc9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1fg43we/bulls_close_out_a_perfect_week_91324_spy_es/

# Wall Street To Cap Banker’s Weekly Hours… To 80 Hours

JPMorgan and Bank of America are stepping up to address the workload crisis for junior bankers. JPMorgan is capping weekly hours at 80, though exceptions for live deals remain—so don’t throw out the energy drinks just yet. Meanwhile, BofA is introducing a new platform where junior bankers will log their hours daily, ensuring managers can better distribute tasks and keep workloads in check. These changes come after mounting pressure, following reports of junior bankers logging 100-hour weeks to keep up with deal demands.

The tipping point? A tragic death earlier this year of a 35-year-old BofA banker after weeks of excessive work hours. JPMorgan’s cap on hours might seem like a win for work-life balance, but there’s a catch: deals in progress are exempt. Over at BofA, while the new platform sounds promising, it's still unclear whether it will lead to meaningful changes or just offer a digital diary for logging those inevitable late nights.

Both banks are looking for ways to prevent further incidents and reduce the negative stigma surrounding the grueling investment banking lifestyle. JPMorgan already had a “pencils down” period from Friday night to Saturday noon and a guaranteed weekend off every three months, but the new 80-hour cap marks a more structured approach to limiting work hours. BofA’s new system aims to catch workload imbalances early, but it remains to be seen whether junior bankers will actually see relief.

# More Change or More of the Same?

Wall Street’s notorious “work-till-you-drop” culture has long been a rite of passage for those seeking high-flying careers in finance. Junior bankers sign up knowing the drill—punishing hours in exchange for sky-high salaries. However, with Silicon Valley offering better work-life balance (and still plenty of cash), the appeal of endless all-nighters is fading fast. While these new measures might improve conditions on paper, real change will depend on whether banks truly enforce these guidelines, or if they simply become another box to check off in the workday marathon.

There’s also skepticism about whether these reforms will hold up under pressure, especially during deal-heavy periods. With lucrative mergers and acquisitions at stake, junior bankers may still be forced to push the limits, leaving the promise of better hours more of an optimistic goal than a hard-and-fast rule. Will Wall Street finally change its tune, or will the grind remain part of the game? Only time will tell.

# Spacewalks and Space Suits — Just Another Day for SpaceX

Move over, NASA. SpaceX just took commercial space travel to a whole new level. On Thursday morning, billionaire Jared Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis strutted out into space—well, sort of. The two became the first private astronauts to complete a commercial spacewalk, testing out shiny new SpaceX-designed suits while floating 870 miles above Earth. That’s three times higher than the International Space Station, for those keeping score at home.

This is all part of the Polaris Dawn mission, which Isaacman funded himself. It’s the kind of mission that makes you rethink your morning commute as these astronauts spent an hour doing mobility tests before heading back inside the SpaceX Crew Dragon. No big deal, just another day at the office—if your office is outer space.

The real highlight? These SpaceX suits. They’ve never been tested in orbit before, and now they’re out there proving they can handle the vacuum of space. This is a major step for SpaceX, as the company plans to build even more suits for future missions to the moon and Mars. Thousands of spacesuits will be needed for those long-term goals, so this was their first big real-world test.

# Beyond the Walk: Space Tourism’s Next Big Thing?

Isaacman’s spacewalk wasn’t just for show—it’s part of SpaceX’s broader mission to make space tourism the next big thing. While Isaacman and Gillis were testing their suits, the rest of the crew was busy helping advance SpaceX's Starlink communications network and conducting scientific experiments. It’s all in a day's work when your job involves pushing the limits of human exploration.

The real kicker? This spacewalk wasn’t just a leap for Isaacman and his crew but for anyone dreaming of a cosmic getaway. With SpaceX pushing boundaries like these, it’s no longer a question of if, but when, space tourism will take off in full swing. Soon, your next vacation might involve packing a spacesuit instead of sunscreen. So, who’s ready to orbit?

3046,Looking for Insights on Small-Cap Mining Stocks,"I recently posted in another investment subreddit, but I’m hoping to gather more opinions from this community. Lately, I’ve been moving away from the usual high-volatility markets (like crypto) and exploring niche sectors, especially mining. I’m particularly interested in small-cap mining companies that might be undervalued but have potential for significant growth.

One company caught my eye for example (not naming/shilling). They’re working on district-scale exploration projects, and their current market cap is quite low, which makes me wonder if there’s some serious upside here. However, I’m relatively new to mining investments and want to better understand the risks and rewards associated with these smaller players.

How do you all assess the potential of these niche companies, particularly in the mining sector? Are there specific metrics or red flags I should be watching for?

3048,INTC BULLISH,"# A message from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to employees regarding the next phase of Intel's transformation

[ Download as PDF](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_769b67adab67f884c5ab54f9da520ada/intel/news/2024-09-16_A_message_from_Intel_CEO_Pat_Gelsinger_to_1710.pdf)Sep 16, 2024 • 4:04 PM EDT

Team,

All eyes have been on Intel since we announced Q2 earnings. There has been no shortage of rumors and speculation about the company, including last week’s Board of Directors meeting, so I’m writing today to provide some updates and outline what comes next.

Let me start by saying we had a highly productive and supportive Board meeting. We have a strong Board comprised of independent directors whose job it is to challenge and push us to perform at our best. And we had deep discussions about our strategy, our portfolio and the immediate progress we are making against the plan we announced on August 1.

The Board and I agreed that we have a lot of work ahead to drive greater efficiency, improve our profitability and enhance our market competitiveness—and there are three key takeaways from last week’s meeting that I want to focus on:

1. We must build on our momentum in Foundry as we near the launch of Intel 18A and drive greater capital efficiency across this part of our business.
2. We must continue acting with urgency to create a more competitive cost structure and deliver the $10B in savings target we announced last month.
3. We must refocus on our strong x86 franchise as we drive our AI strategy while streamlining our product portfolio in service to Intel customers and partners.

We have several pieces of news to share that support these priorities.      

**Amazon Web Services selects Intel Foundry**

Today we announced that we will [expand our strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-strategic-collaboration.html) (AWS). This includes a co-investment in custom chip designs, and we have announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework covering product and wafers from Intel.

Specifically, Intel Foundry will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A. We will also produce a custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 that builds on our existing partnership, under which Intel produces Xeon Scalable processors for AWS. More broadly, we expect to have deep engagement with AWS on additional designs spanning Intel 18A, Intel 18AP and Intel 14A.

This framework reflects the power of our “better together” strategy, anchored on our integrated portfolio across foundry services, infrastructure and x86 products. And with the 5N4Y finish line in sight, we are beginning to see a meaningful uptick in interest from foundry customers. This includes continued momentum in advanced packaging, which remains a meaningful differentiator for Intel Foundry as we have tripled our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year.

**U.S. Secure Enclave award**

Earlier today, we also announced that Intel has been awarded up to $3B in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act for the U.S. government’s [Secure Enclave](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/2024-intel-news.html) program. This program is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government. As the only American company that both designs and manufactures leading-edge logic chips, we will help secure the domestic chip supply chain.

This news, combined with our AWS announcement, demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business.

**Greater independence for Intel Foundry**

To build on our progress, we plan to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary inside of Intel. This governance structure will complete the process we initiated earlier this year when we separated the P&L and financial reporting for Intel Foundry and Intel Products.

A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation.

There is no change to our Intel Foundry leadership team, which continues to report to me. We will also establish an operating board that includes independent directors to govern the subsidiary. This supports our continued focus on driving greater transparency, optimization and accountability across the business.

A more focused and efficient Intel Foundry will further enhance collaboration with Intel Products. And our capabilities across design and manufacturing will remain a source of competitive differentiation and strength.

**A more efficient Intel Foundry manufacturing buildout**

A key priority for Intel Foundry is to increase our capital efficiency. Our manufacturing investments across three continents have laid the foundation for a world-class foundry for the AI era. Now that we have completed our transition to EUV, it’s time to shift from a period of accelerated investment to a more normalized cadence of node development and a more flexible and efficient capital plan.

We will maintain our Smart Capital approach to maximize financial flexibility as we complete our manufacturing buildout, making some adjustments to the near-term scope and pace of our manufacturing expansion.

* We recently increased capacity in Europe through our fab in Ireland, which will remain our lead European hub for the foreseeable future. We will pause our projects in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand.
* Malaysia remains an active design and manufacturing hub through our existing operations. We plan to complete the construction of our new advanced packaging factory in Malaysia but will align the startup with market conditions and increased utilization of our existing capacity.
* There are no changes to our other manufacturing locations. We remain committed to our U.S. manufacturing investments and are moving forward with our projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio. We remain well-positioned to scale up production around the world based on market demand as we grow our foundry business.

**A stronger Intel Products portfolio focused on x86**

We are also taking actions to strengthen and streamline our Intel Products portfolio, where we have identified clear opportunities to drive greater focus, speed and efficiency.

Our top priority is to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across client, edge and data center markets, including with a broader range of custom chiplets and other customized offerings that meet emerging customer needs, as demonstrated by today’s AWS announcement.

Our AI investments—including continued leadership of the AI PC category, our strong position with AI in data center, and our accelerator portfolio—will leverage and complement our x86 franchise with a focus on enterprise, cost-efficient inferencing. 

Alongside this, we are taking steps toward simplifying our portfolio to unlock efficiency, accelerate innovation and deliver more integrated solutions.

This includes moving our Edge and Automotive businesses into CCG, where we have a big opportunity to leverage our core client business and extend our leadership in the AI PC category to a wide range of vertical edge solutions. In NEX, we will be focusing the business on networking and telco. And we are moving Integrated Photonics Solutions into DCAI as we focus on driving a more focused R&D plan that's fully aligned with our top business priorities. 

In addition, we are integrating our Software and Incubation business into our core business units to foster more integrated roadmaps, unlock efficiencies and create value.

**An engine of financial performance**

Collectively, these changes are critical steps forward as we build a leaner, simpler and more efficient Intel. And they build on the immediate progress we have made since announcing our plan on August 1 to create a more competitive cost structure.

Through our voluntary early retirement and separation offerings, we are more than halfway to our workforce reduction target of approximately 15,000 by the end of the year. We still have difficult decisions to make and will notify impacted employees in the middle of October. Additionally, we are implementing plans to reduce or exit about two-thirds of our real estate globally by the end of the year.

As we continue acting with urgency to execute the plan we announced last month, we are also working to carefully manage our cash as we meaningfully improve our balance sheet and liquidity. This includes through selling part of our stake in Altera—which is something we have talked about publicly several times and has long been part of our strategy to generate proceeds for Intel on Altera’s path to an IPO.

All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving.

We must maintain our focus on innovation while also becoming an engine of operational efficiency and financial performance that’s built to win in the market.

As I’ve said before, this is the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades. Not since the memory to microprocessor transition have we attempted something so essential. We succeeded then—and we will meet this moment and build a stronger Intel for decades to come.  

On behalf of the entire ELT and our Board of Directors, thank you for all you’re doing. I greatly appreciate your patience, grit and resilience as we do the hard work needed to deliver on our plan and position our company for the future.

Pat

3054,Osteosarcoma and ADCs: A Billion-Dollar Opportunity in Cancer Therapy,"OS Therapies are using a special bacteria called Listeria to help fight cancer. The company changes Listeria so it can attack cancer cells that have a certain protein called HER2, which is common in some cancers like breast cancer and osteosarcoma.

**Description of how it works**  
  
When the modified Listeria enters the body, it causes the immune system to react and destroy cancer cells. The idea is that the immune system will learn to fight the cancer, which could help patients get better faster and reduce the chance of cancer coming back.

The company is starting by testing this treatment on a rare bone cancer called osteosarcoma, mostly found in kids and young adults. If the treatment works, they can sell it to bigger drug companies or use it to help treat other cancers, like breast or lung cancer. They also want to see if the treatment can help dogs with cancer, which could raise more money to help develop it further.

OS Therapies is hoping to show that their treatment can improve survival rates and make a big difference for people with these types of cancer. If their tests go well, they can sell the technology to larger companies or use it to make new cancer treatments. They’ve raised money by selling stock, but they’ll need more to continue their research.

**How Big is the Industry?**

The human osteosarcoma market is estimated to have a total addressable market **(TAM) of approximately $1.72 billion**. This reflects the large unmet medical needs, the high costs of current treatments, and the potential for innovative therapies to make an impact.

Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are emerging as a revolutionary approach in targeted cancer treatments. By combining the accuracy of monoclonal antibodies with the cancer-killing abilities of cytotoxic drugs, ADCs are designed to target cancer cells specifically, reducing damage to healthy tissues.

The global ADC market is experiencing rapid growth. According to MarketsandMarkets, the ADC market is projected to reach $19.8 billion by 2028, with a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecast period.

With the significant TAM for osteosarcoma and the growing ADC market, there is a considerable opportunity for therapies that leverage ADCs’ precision to address the need for more effective osteosarcoma treatments.

# TikTok on Trial — Ban or Buyout?

TikTok just entered the legal ring, kicking off a battle in a D.C. appeals court that could decide whether the app sticks around in our daily scrolls—or faces a forced sale to a U.S. company.

But TikTok’s not going down without a fight. The app’s lawyers argued that banning it violates the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans who love nothing more than endless dance challenges and skincare hacks. The judges, however, weren’t totally buying it, especially given *national security concerns*. The U.S. government’s worried that ByteDance’s ties to China could turn TikTok into a spy tool or disinformation factory. (Yikes!)

# First Amendment vs. National Security—Who You Got?

The Justice Department says it’s *not* trying to curb free speech but instead protect Americans from China’s potential influence. According to the DOJ, some of TikTok’s algorithm is still cooked up in China, meaning the government there could, theoretically, tap into U.S. data or mess with what content gets pushed to our For You pages.

TikTok, meanwhile, insists there’s no proof that China’s been snooping on U.S. users. They’ve already spent $2 billion to wall off data on Oracle’s U.S.-based servers. Plus, they argue there are less extreme options than a full-on ban—like keeping their algorithm transparent (as if anyone really understands how that thing works). But the judges didn’t seem sold on that idea, with one comparing it to past rulings that blocked foreign-owned businesses for *national security reasons*.

Of course, TikTok’s not just fighting the legal system—they’re battling the court of public opinion too. The app's become a cultural cornerstone, especially for Gen Z, who are *very* attached to their dopamine hits in the form of viral memes and 15-second clips. Any move to ban it could spark a full-blown social media revolt, which lawmakers are *definitely* keeping in mind as elections loom.

# What’s Next for TikTok?

The clock is ticking for TikTok, with a decision expected by December. If they lose? They’re ready to take it all the way to the Supreme Court—after all, their U.S. operations are at stake. Meanwhile, in the court of public opinion, TikTok’s gaining ground: only 32% of Americans now support a ban, down from 50% last year.

So, will TikTok survive the legal showdown? Or will we be stuck with YouTube Shorts and Reels (aka TikTok’s less-cool cousins)?

# Rate Cuts — 25 Or 50?

The Federal Reserve is gearing up to give borrowing costs a chop, but how much of a trim will it be? Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are facing a tough decision at their meeting this week, as they weigh a quarter-point cut (their go-to move) or a more dramatic half-point slash. The big idea here is to cool inflation while keeping employment healthy. But, spoiler alert: it’s complicated.

Recent economic data shows inflation has eased, but the labor market is losing steam too—unemployment ticked up to 4.2% in August, while job growth slowed to a monthly average of 116,000 from 212,000 just last December. So, what’s a central bank to do? Some experts, like former Fed adviser William English, argue that a bigger 50 basis point cut could act as a safeguard for economic growth. On the other hand, a smaller 25 basis point cut would show confidence that things are stable enough for gradual moves.

# Shifting Expectations and Powell's Next Move

A few weeks ago, most investors bet on a quarter-point reduction. Then, some more aggressive forecasts started floating around, nudging predictions towards a 50-point cut. A key reason for the flip? Worries that cutting too little, too slowly, could leave the Fed playing catch-up, especially if the job market sours faster than expected.

Fed officials are keeping their cards close to the chest, with Powell possibly facing the first dissenting vote in years. That split reflects honest uncertainty, not a heated debate—more of a ""no one knows for sure"" kind of moment. Powell will also share economic projections after the meeting, which might offer clues on how fast or slow the Fed plans to act in the months ahead.

# Risky Business: How Much is Too Much?

As much as the Fed wants to get ahead of inflation, they’re also wary of going too far, too fast. Powell & Co. are trying to avoid a scenario where they cut rates aggressively, only to stoke risky investments and—oh, hello—higher inflation. Former Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan thinks a half-point cut makes sense, given the current economic conditions. But he also notes that even after a couple of cuts, rates would still be relatively high.

So, while the market holds its breath, the Fed is figuring out how to hit that sweet spot—cooling inflation without dragging the economy into a downward spiral. Either way, Powell’s decision is set to move markets.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready: Tomorrow, the Fed’s about to make its move with what’s expected to be the first rate cut since March 2020.

The journey here? Not exactly smooth sailing. At the beginning of the year, Wall Street was betting on six rate cuts (seems a bit ambitious in hindsight). But those dreams evaporated fast once inflation didn’t pack up and leave in Q1.

Now, with inflation easing up, the focus has shifted to jobs. The labor market’s been cooling off, and back in August, the market freaked out, worried the Fed waited too long to cut rates and stave off a recession.

So, will the Fed slash rates by 25 or 50 basis points? (Feel free to place your bets.) How the market reacts is still anyone’s guess, but one thing’s for sure—this rollercoaster’s nearing the final drop.

3059,Here is Some Above Average Due Diligence ,"Let’s take a closer look at OS Therapies (OSTX)—an exciting new company making waves with its recent stock momentum. Focused on developing cutting-edge treatments for osteosarcoma and other solid tumors, OS Therapies is bringing innovative solutions to patients who need them most. But how is the company progressing, and what does this mean for potential investors? Let’s dive into the details.

**Company Overview**

OS Therapies (OSTX) is on a mission to tackle tough cancers, like osteosarcoma, especially in kids and young adults. They’re working on new therapies for bone cancers and solid tumors, with their lead treatment, OST-HER2, aimed at HER-2 positive osteosarcoma. This candidate is being fast-tracked through clinical trials, and they’re also pushing forward with another promising treatment, OST-tADC, in their research pipeline.

**Financial Health After the IPO**

OS Therapies made big moves with its IPO on July 31, 2024, raising $6.4 million. This funding will keep their operations going strong through mid-2025. Even better, they’ve wiped out all their debt by converting preferred shares and liabilities into equity. With 20.85 million common shares outstanding (1.86 million available for public trading), OS Therapies is sitting on solid financial ground to keep pushing its research forward.

The company’s financials are looking brighter, too. They reported a net operating loss of $1.557 million in Q2 2024, which is a solid improvement from the $2.505 million loss in the same period last year. With their lead treatment entering the observation phase, OS Therapies is well on its way to reducing costs. Plus, their net loss per share dropped from $0.47 to $0.26, thanks to the increased number of shares.

**Market Opportunity**

The potential market for osteosarcoma treatments is estimated to be $1.72 billion, highlighting the urgent need for new, effective therapies. OS Therapies is stepping into this space with a unique focus on Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)—a cutting-edge approach to cancer treatment. ADCs combine the precision of monoclonal antibodies with powerful cancer-killing drugs, targeting only the cancer cells and leaving healthy ones alone.

This market is booming, with the global ADC market expected to hit $19.8 billion by 2028. With OS Therapies working on ADC-based treatments, they’re in a prime spot to take advantage of this growing sector.

**Leadership Team**

Paul Romness, MHP – CEO

Paul Romness leads OS Therapies with over 25 years in the biopharmaceutical industry. He’s played key roles at major companies like Johnson & Johnson and Amgen, helping launch nine products across different therapeutic areas. With a Bachelor’s in Finance and a Master’s in Health Policy, Paul knows the business inside and out.

Dr. Robert Petit, PhD – Chief Medical & Scientific Officer

Dr. Robert Petit brings serious expertise in biotechnology, oncology, and immunology. He’s worked in both public and private companies, guiding product development and regulatory strategies. He’s all about improving patient outcomes and driving innovation in cancer treatments.

OS Therapies is in a great position to make real progress in the fight against osteosarcoma and other tough cancers. Their recent IPO has given them the financial backing they need to accelerate clinical trials and move their treatments closer to the market. With no debt and a focus on the growing ADC market, the company is well-equipped to continue its research and capitalize on the growing demand for targeted cancer therapies. For investors, OS Therapies presents a promising opportunity to be part of the next wave of cancer treatment innovation.

* The Fed cut rates by 0.5% on Wednesday, marking its first reduction in four years, and the markets had a rollercoaster ride. Stocks initially spiked on the news but lost steam after Fed Chair Jerome Powell poured some cold water on hopes for more aggressive cuts. While the rate drop is a relief, Powell’s cautious tone on future reductions left traders feeling like they’d just been teased with a candy bar and then had it swiped away.
* By the end of the day, the S&P 500 wiped out a 1% gain, while the Nasdaq and Dow both dipped around 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Fed’s outlook signaled two more rate cuts could be in store for 2024, hinting that the easy-money party isn’t over just yet. But for now, investors are left on pause—except for small caps, which flexed their muscles as the Russell 2000 soared.

# Fed Makes a Big Cut…



In a move that's been years in the making, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by a half-point on Wednesday, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5%. It’s the first rate cut since the Fed started its battle against inflation back in 2022. The goal? To give the labor market a little boost without spiraling inflation out of control. While 10 out of 19 Fed officials are betting on another cut before the year is over, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made sure to tamp down any dreams of a rate-cut bonanza.

“This isn’t some new normal,” Powell warned, reminding everyone that the Fed's decisions will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. In other words, don’t get too comfortable with the idea of more cuts.

# Bowman: The Lone Wolf

But it wasn’t all kumbaya in the Fed’s meeting. Governor Michelle Bowman, the committee’s resident contrarian, voted against the half-point cut, pushing for a more modest quarter-point reduction instead. It's the first time a Fed governor has dissented since 2005, making Bowman’s stance a big deal.

Her reasoning? She’s worried that the bigger cut might be overkill and could risk reigniting inflation down the road. Still, Powell got the majority of the committee on his side, proving that sometimes you’ve got to go big or go home when it comes to steering the economy.

# Markets, Meet Rollercoaster

The markets reacted like a kid who's had too much sugar—first bouncing up, then coming down hard. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high after the announcement, only to end the day in the red. Treasury yields also took a dip, and investors are already placing bets on another 75 basis points worth of cuts by year-end. It’s like a game of rate cut roulette.

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. The Fed’s projections show that the unemployment rate is likely to creep up to 4.4% by the end of 2024, while inflation is expected to cool down to 2.3%. So while the economy might get a slight reprieve, the Fed isn’t quite ready to let things fly loose.

# JPMorgan Wants a Bite of the Apple Card

JPMorgan Chase is cozying up to Apple, looking to snatch the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs' hands—but it’s not a done deal yet. While the talks are heating up, JPMorgan is coming in with demands. First on the list? They want to pay less than the full $17 billion in outstanding balances because Goldman’s been dealing with elevated losses. Seems like those shiny new Apple Card users have been a bit more “spend now, worry later” than expected.

But that’s not all. JPMorgan is also eyeing a change to Apple’s unique billing cycle. Right now, all Apple Card users get their statements at the start of the month, which may sound neat, but it’s been causing a customer service nightmare. JPMorgan wants to ditch that system to avoid the flood of phone calls that Goldman has been drowning in.

# Goldman’s Breakup, JPMorgan’s Opportunity

This potential takeover would mark a big shift for Apple, which needs a new financial partner after Goldman decided to exit the consumer finance scene faster than you can say “we’re out.” With 12 million Apple Card users on the line, Apple’s been talking to several suitors—including Capital One and Synchrony Financial—but JPMorgan’s the front-runner thanks to its scale and influence. After all, why settle for second best when you can have the biggest credit card issuer in the country?

Still, JPMorgan’s not walking into this without checking the fine print. The bank is cautious, especially with Goldman’s regulatory headaches and the high delinquency rates that have plagued the Apple Card portfolio. But landing this deal would give JPMorgan access to Apple’s loyal customer base and a chance to pitch more financial products to millions of iPhone-wielding fans.

# Negotiations Continue—Will It All Come Together?

Of course, no deal is ever simple, and there are still plenty of details to work out. JPMorgan wants to tweak the terms of the Apple Card, and both companies need to agree on the price tag. With concerns over a potential economic slowdown looming, JPMorgan is keen to make sure it doesn’t bite off more than it can chew.

As the talks continue, the big question is whether Apple and JPMorgan can find common ground. For now, they’re both playing their cards close to the chest (pun intended), but one thing’s for sure—if this deal goes through, it’ll be a game-changer in the world of co-branded credit cards.

3067,Is Alibaba the Hidden Gem of 2024-5?,"I've been thinking a lot about BABA. Mainly whether or not the company looks good despite the general bad sentiment about investing in Chinese companies right now. 

https://preview.redd.it/z4vrg4m9otpd1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e042a6b617260c71efd4b420db89e318fd9d106

Alright. Here's my Thesis:



Despite mixed results on recent earnings, Alibaba is undervalued and positioned for growth, for the most part because of their investment in cloud and AI.



**Key Insights from Recent Earnings:** 

* Revenue increased by 4% year-over-year, net income fell by 27%. However, a closer look reveals the company is shifting focus from low-margin businesses to more profitable segments, particularly in their cloud operations. 

	

https://preview.redd.it/fcfg7w2cotpd1.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39ee03d0c581e92f274cd78d35d3feb0457ac94



* Their cloud revenue saw a 6% increase, with cloud-related AI products soaring over 100% year-on-year and overall cloud segment EBITA has gone up quite a bit.

	

https://preview.redd.it/9p00yrofotpd1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ffc23954a3958d2f82ab58b457be98bb372e34



* Alibaba repurchased $5.8 billion worth of shares, if its because of their enlightenment then that would mean they too think their undervalued. By using cash reserves (over $55 billion net cash), Alibaba is effectively returning capital to shareholders, which I see as a positive strategy.



* Alibaba still generated $4.63 billion from operating cash flow this quarter, even as it saw a decline in free cash flow due to increased capital expenditures. This indicates ongoing profitability, and the company has clear potential to recover as the capital investments begin to yield higher returns.



* Alibaba holds a whopping 39% share of China's cloud market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.75% through 2029. As Alibaba Cloud expands its capabilities and profitability, the growth prospects could drastically enhance the company’s overall valuation.



* Their 88 VIP program is seeing double-digit growth in subscriptions, similar to Amazon Prime, which points to a loyal customer base and future revenue stability.

# Nike Shakes It Up — CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who’s stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe’s last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

I try to write 3+ articles per week. It's helped me a ton with my communication skills, writing technical design docs at work, and overall sharing the crazy ideas I have in my head.

Until now, there was no way for me to repurpose the articles that I wrote. I've tried text-to-video tools in the past, but they're all hot garbage.

Google's new [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) literally transformed how us writers can distribute our content.

It's basically an AI-podcast generator. It creates an extremely realistic and interesting podcast between two people. Honestly, I would listen to it for fun, and I don't think it sounds AI-Generated.

I then combine it with [Headliner](https://make.headliner.app/), a tool for generating automated audiograms. This makes it possible to convert my audio to a video, and post it on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.

Sharing my first creation with this group. I [converted this article](https://medium.com/p/576a6039e8fa) to the following videos:

* [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/xfuo0bwVOro)

The article (and podcast) is about a fun experiment I did using OpenAI's new o1-mini (strawberry) model. I asked it to develop an automated trading strategy using [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/), and found it very effective in doing so, even without manual human intervention.

And the generated final product from Google is amazing! Like, its so interesting that I listen to it for fun. I'm about to convert every single one of my popular articles into podcasts.

3074,"A structural deficit and additional production cuts announced by the biggest uranium producer in the world + followed by supply problem warning + followed by Putin now: Hi Western utilities, we could restrict supply of uranium to you","Hi everyone,

Now that the FED announced their interest rate decision, we can again look beyond that... 

For those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.

**A.** Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond

My previous post of 21 days ago explains this more in detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f4y4ha/kazatomprom\_17\_cut\_in\_expected\_production2025\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1f4y4ha/kazatomprom_17_cut_in_expected_production2025_in/)

Keep in mind: Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.

Conclusion of previous post:

**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.

And the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket.

There is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.

And that while uranium demand is price INelastic!

And before that announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/cjtih954hypd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4efc8e87882c3957cf6bbba319ecdb2f242acffb)

**B.** September 10th, 2024: Kazakhstan starting to tell western utilities that they will get less uranium supply then they hoped

[Source: The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/v809myy6hypd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42d759ded982285d6527e79e56b4b0b8473e75e7)

  
**C.** Putin suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West

https://preview.redd.it/ajdulev9hypd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20eab4f05821d2adc37d6300d3a6db8e022ea139

  
To give you an idea:

**A.** 70% of world uranium consumption is in the West (USA, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Korea), while only 40% of world uranium production ( comes from the West and Africa combined.

In other words most of uranium comes from Asia (Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan and China): 29,400 tU in 2022

Total operable reactors in the West: 280,551 Mwe

Total operable reactors in the world: 395,388 Mwe

This threat from Putin alone is sufficient for western utilities to lose the last perception of security of uranium supply

**B.** Russia is an important supplier of uranium and even more of enriched uranium for Europe and USA.

The possible loss of Russian enriched uranium supply is actually a bigger problem, because Russia is responsible for \~40% of world enrichment services. The biggest part of uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia for Europe and USA is first enriched in Russia.

Uranium to Europe:

[Source: Euratom](https://preview.redd.it/rk128zxbhypd1.jpg?width=919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6210e1b49977a534c87af5ad904962b7b55c2a05)

Uranium to USA:

[Source: EIA](https://preview.redd.it/lnzbvdgehypd1.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b766ef931bef39288d0923867bbd655f24e6c15d)

**C.** And besides that. There are 2 routes for uranium from Kazakhstan to the West: the Saint-Petersburg route and the Caspian route

But Kazaktomprom just said that the Caspian route was much more costely and that the supply of uranium to the West has become very difficult.

Because most Kazakhstan uranium destined for the West gets enriched in Russia first, Putin is in fact not only threathing russian uranium but also uranium from Kazakhstan

When looking at the numbers, this threat is an electroshock for Western utilities (USA, Europe, South Korea, Japan)

Utilities will assess this additional news now, and most probably accelerate and increase the uranium purchases in coming weeks and months in preparation for possible export restrictions by Russia for uranium.

Important comment 1: In terms of revenue, uranium and enriched uranium revenues are significantly smaller than their oil and gas revenues. And with a higher uranium price due to russian restrictions on uranium supply to 70% of world uranium consumers, Russia will be able to sell uranium at much higher price at India, China, ...

[Source: Lenta](https://preview.redd.it/ia2qxriuhypd1.jpg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b54ad280fe1b09918c71da236be72ec7273ff62)



Important comment: The uranium spotmarket is not like the copper, gold, oil market.

a) The uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.

b) The uranium spotmarket doesn't react instantly on news, like a liquid copper, gold, oil market does. In the uranium sector the few actors with access to the uranium spotmarket take their time to analyse data before starting to act. But ones they start to act it goes very fast

**D. Undervalued compared to the intrinsic value**

**Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~24.85 CAD/share or \~18.33 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 6.50 %

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.60 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.



**A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNP.L): 100% invested in uranium sector
* Geiger Counter Limited (GCL.L): 100% invested in uranium sector

**Uranium Royalty Corp** (URC / UROY): the only Royalty and streaming company in the uranium sector physical uranium and annual uranium deliveries from current productions

Note: I post this now (at the gradual start of high season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. We are now gradually entering the high season again. Previous 2 weeks were calm, because everyone of the uranium and nuclear industry was at the World Nuclear Symposium in London (September 4th - 6th, 2024), and the week after the utilities started assessing all the new information they got from Kazakhstan, Russia and the WNA Symposium. Now they are analysing the market again and prepare for uranium purchases in coming weeks and months.

For those interested. No need to rush. Take time to double check the information I'm giving here, before potentially doing something.

3096,IDC MR head display market ushered in a 41.4% explosive growth; Snap/ WiMi combine AR with AI technology,"IDC has released new quarterly tracking data, predicting that the industry will grow from 6.7 million units in 2024 to 22.9 million units in 2028, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.3%.

The market will soar to 41.4% in 2025 due to new technologies and more affordable devices, and thanks to the convergence of AR and VR, MR devices are expected to take the lead, with more than 70% of the market share in 2028.



**MR devices are expected to take the lead**

IDC says MR headsets have made a leap in fidelity in recent quarters, based on the launch of Quest 3 and Vision Pro. Meta is expected to launch a more affordable version, which will help the market resume growth in the coming year.

In addition, extended reality heads are expected to grow due to the addition of AI and consumer-friendly designs. Many new startups and next-generation products from prominent brands are targeting the ‘smart glasses’ space, adding AI, while adopting thinner designs to cater to consumers.



IDC believes that AR devices are also expected to drive growth, and existing well-known AR products such as HoloLens are expected to give way to MR devices in the future, as the new headset can meet some use cases and be more affordable.

 

S**everal companies have released new products**

In fact, the recent AR and VR market news continues. Snap (SNAP) recently held the 2024 Snap Global Partnership Summit. This year, in addition to its social platform SnapChat and AR filter creation platform Lens Studio, the new generation of Spectacles AR glasses is being unveiled.



The new Spectacles’ 24 glasses feature waveguide + LCoS optics, four tracking cameras, and support a Snap space engine for seamless gesture tracking. With Snap’s new Spectacles Interactive Toolkit (Spectacles Interaction Kit), developers can easily build apps without developing their own interactive systems from zero.

In addition, as PICO’s first MR mixed reality all-in-one products, PICO 4 Ultra through comprehensive leading flagship configuration, full link space video ability, with PICO body feeling tracker, and rich MR application ecology, the real world elements into the virtual world, bring users cover games, movie, fitness, screen, office, and other scenarios of new MR head show experience.



PICO 4 Ultra Is a device focusing on MR experience, which has made unprecedented breakthroughs in human-computer interaction, ecological interconnection and other aspects. Users can not only interact with virtual content in the realistic physical environment, but also switch between different devices at will, realizing silky, smooth and seamless connection. Today, PICO 4 UltraMR hybrid reality all-in-one machines are now on sale on all platforms.

 

W**iMi builds a leading comprehensive capability**

At the same time, the data shows, WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) as XR headset display pioneer and industry leader, based on its display in 3D and VR virtual reality, AR augmented reality, MR mixed reality, AI in the field of leading technology advantage and deep technology accumulation, whether in the upstream core technology, or terminal products, or downstream applications, have a huge opportunity, to create greater value for the society.

At present, WiMi mainly for augmented reality headset display equipment, including XR headset display, AI viewing glasses products prospective layout, through technological innovation and hardware research and development, build a more visual experience friendly display interface, with comfortable, good, healthy experience, can be widely used in viewing, play games, watch live, the aerial / FPV consumer entertainment areas, with advanced technology for people to create a good horizon and life experience.

What needs to be understood is that with the accelerated commercialization of AI technology, AI innovation in the business field has entered an active period, bringing consumers greater choice and autonomy. Artificial intelligence also happens to be one of the pillar industries of WiMi. Based on the complete XR industry chain, XR equipment is the excellent terminal carrier of artificial general intelligence AGI. WiMI supports multi-scene matching through AI and XR virtual experience, and will further create clearer and more comfortable HD products in the future.

 

T**o sum up**

At present, with the rapid development of AI AI technology, the cutting-edge industries including virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality, detonated the global giants. This means that the mixed reality devices of the future are more than just personal entertainment or productivity tools, but are more likely to be an important vehicle connecting the daily life, work and social life of the masses. For companies, ensuring that they continue to dominate this emerging field is not only a need for technological innovation, but also a strategic need to maintain market dominance.

3100,"With this strategy, I left a job I didn't like","A few months ago, I realized that I couldn't work for someone else anymore, especially when combining it with my studies. I constantly felt like I was losing control of my life. So I decided to quit my job and start looking for alternatives. I wanted to find something that would give me the opportunity to earn money, but without being constantly tied to a schedule or bosses.

That's how I came across the IOST network, a decentralized platform that allows you to earn money simply through transactions. The idea is that you get a small reward for each transaction. At first it seemed interesting, so I decided to give it a try. After a few days, I realized that it not only works, but can also become a stable source of income.

The best thing about it is that you control the process yourself: you make as many transactions as you want and at any time convenient for you. There is no need to adapt to someone else's schedule or timetable. This gives you a sense of freedom that you lacked before.

If you're just starting out and want to try something new, this can be a great option. I started small, but quickly realized that this path was worthwhile.

If you are interested in trying this method, here is the step-by-step algorithm:

- Purchase USDT on Binance.

- Exchange USDT for IOST.

- In the “Deposits” tab, copy your memo - you will need it for further actions.

Next, in the “Withdrawal” section, enter the following information:

- Address: coin\_up (this is a test address for verification),

- Memo: paste the previously copied code,

- Network: select IOST.

Complete the transaction and in about 10 minutes you will receive an additional bonus of 0.25% in the form of IOST.

This strategy is especially attractive because it does not require large investments at the start. You can start with small amounts and gradually increase the volume of transactions when the process becomes clear and convenient for you.

3101,My $PAUIF pick from my last watchlist is up 25% | Now turning my attention back to $RNXT after it erupted for 24% last Friday,"Morning everyone! I wanted to highlight that on my last watchlist, we went 2/2 and hit our targets. Not too shabby. That said, we must continue finding plays and $RNXT is back in the limelight after exploding last Friday.

Although $RNXT has been trending down, for a couple months, the amount of volume traded on friday can not go unnoticed. It was the most volume since last April. I will talk about their recent news drop in a sec, but first, I want to point out the entry/pullback I am looking for after its 24% move.Getting into $RNXT - waiting for the pullback between $1.15 and $1

* Potential bounce off the $1 support  

**Recent News Drop from $RNXT Team:**

A study showed that patients treated with TAMP after undergoing chemoradiation had an overall survival of 27 months, which is a significant observation for a challenging cancer type.

Upcoming presentation: Dr. Ripal Gandhi will present more about this treatment and the clinical trial at a medical symposium. He’ll discuss the challenges of existing treatments, the TAMP platform, and recent clinical data that supports its effectiveness.

The ongoing clinical trial (TIGeR-PaC): This is a Phase III trial that tests the TAMP method using a specific chemotherapy drug (gemcitabine) in LAPC patients. The trial aims to see if TAMP can improve survival and reduce side effects compared to standard treatments. The results so far have encouraged the continuation of the study.

3103,Hudson Pacific Properties ($HPP) - Is There Value in This Decline?,"Hudson Pacific Properties (HPP) has been going through the gauntlet. Share price plummeted from a peak of $38 in February 2020 to just around $5.11 today – an 88% drop. HPP owns and operates a range of office properties from Silicon Valley to the UK which of course is an sector that really struggled since Covid. But offices do look like they might be rebounding. 



There's some mixed signs.



* The company's revenue and operating income have both shown significant declines operating income is -$22M. 
* Average occupancy rates are down to 77.6% which is 7% lower than last year.
* The company’s market cap is $724 million, while the book value is at $3.13 billion, so it's priced at .3 times the value of its assets.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass—and throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk’s SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel *just a little* uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump’s border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a “lowball” deal to buy the land—at less than half its value. CAH’s response? “Go f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.”

**""Wait—Cards Against** ***Who*****?"":** In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump’s border wall construction. The plot was left in its “natural state,” with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX’s construction activities—like compacting soil and setting up generators—have, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation—and Customer Trust:** CAH’s complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX’s invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let’s be honest—nothing says “we’re here to fight for your rights” like defending a piece of borderland against the world’s richest man. They’re worried that fans might start thinking they’re somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town—complete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday—about $100—on their $15 contribution. That’s a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

# Meta Connect 2024: AR Glasses, Cheaper VR, and a Heavy Dose of AI

Mark your calendars, tech fans. Meta’s annual Connect developer conference kicks off on September 25th, and it's shaping up to be a buffet of VR, AR, and AI goodies. Expect new hardware, upgraded smart glasses, and AI innovations sprinkled across Meta's platforms like an everything-bagel seasoning.

Meta CEO *and part-time metaverse evangelist* Mark Zuckerberg will lead the keynote, which you can catch on Meta’s website or Horizon Worlds (if you’re living that VR life). Alongside him will be CTO Andrew Bosworth, who will dive deeper into all things AI and AR.

# What's Coming?

Here’s the big stuff Meta might have in store:

* **A New, Cheaper VR Headset:** Word on the street is Meta will unveil a stripped-down version of the Quest 3, the ""Quest 3S,"" priced at a more wallet-friendly $299. The goal? Offer a VR experience that doesn’t break the bank, without sacrificing too much of the Quest 3’s tech magic. If leaks are accurate, this model could bridge the gap between the aging Quest 2 and the pricey Quest 3.
* **Smart Glasses 2.0:** Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are due for an update, and rumors suggest they’ll be getting some AI juice. While the glasses won't quite be AR wizards yet, they’re expected to bring new features, like voice-controlled AI, straight to your stylish shades. Plus, we might get a glimpse of *“Orion,”* Meta’s true AR glasses that could change how we see (literally) reality.
* **AI All Day, Every Day:** AI will be the star of the show, with Meta expected to roll out new chatbot assistants, smarter AI-powered tools, and possibly some celebrity avatars. *Llama 3.1*, Meta’s latest large language model, will likely pop up across Meta’s platforms—think WhatsApp and Instagram with even more AI sass.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month’s report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won’t break the trend, but everyone’s hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates—and home prices—down eventually.

Next up, we’ll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn’t help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Before Market Open:

* **Autozone** ($AZO) has revved up nearly 18% in 2024, fueled by an ambitious share buyback strategy over the past few years. But under the hood, last quarter’s earnings show a few warning lights: same-store sales were stagnant, and free cash flow is starting to slow. With consumer spending tightening, investors are eager to hear how management plans to steer things back on track—otherwise, Autozone’s impressive run could hit a dead end.

BHP, the world's largest mining company, has expressed concerns over the rising global adoption of AI, pointing out that AI’s energy-intensive computing, including data centers, could push global copper demand up by an additional 3.4 million tonnes annually by 2050.



BHP estimates that overall global copper demand will soar to 52.5 million tonnes per year by 2050, marking a 72% increase compared to 2021. However, the world is facing a growing copper shortage, with inventories at historic lows and new mines taking years to bring online.

Zeus North America Mining Corp. (Ticker: ZEUS.c or ZUUZF for U.S. investors) is strategically positioning itself to benefit from the rising demand for copper by exploring resource-rich but underdeveloped areas in Idaho.



Zeus' flagship project, the Cuddy Mountain Property, is adjacent to the Leviathan Copper Porphyry discovery, a major copper system that highlights Zeus’ potential to uncover significant mineral resources. Both properties share a history of silver occurrences and feature volcanic formations and rhyolite, which are favorable for porphyry-style mineralization.

The Leviathan discovery has drawn significant attention to the area, with major industry players like Barrick and Rio Tinto staking claims in the region.   




Zeus is leveraging this momentum by conducting extensive geophysical surveys, soil sampling, and targeted drilling across the Cuddy Mountain property. These efforts are aimed at identifying and prioritizing key exploration targets, with the data expected to guide next year’s potential drilling campaigns.



The Cuddy Mountain project represents a promising opportunity for Zeus to tap into the value of this underexplored but highly sought-after region at a time when copper prices are surging due to rising global demand.

3118,Brookfield Corp. I'm confused but interested,"Brookfield looks like a great value, but really complicated company. Complicated in the ways that capital allocators get complicated with different cap table structures and stuff like that. I think though I've more or less figured it out. And the parent company (BN) looks like a great stock. But I could use a gut check.



# Important Numbers



* **Distributable Earnings on the Rise**: Brookfield reported a record **$2.75 per share in distributable earnings**, a good look there. Their total distributable earnings was **$1.1 billion** for the quarter, which is 11% year-over-year growth.



* **Asset Management Growth**: The asset management subsidiary alone generated **$636 million**, while their wealth solutions (insurance) subsidiary skyrocketed with an **80% increase** year-over-year, contributing about **$300 million** to earnings.



* **Valuation Metrics**: Despite trading at around **$44** per share – significantly below Brookfield's estimated net asset value of **$83.49** – the stock maintains a relatively modest **15.5x cash flow** multiple. Given their projected **20-25% annual growth**, this creates a favorable entry point for value investors. I think they'll see some multiple expansion.

# Strategy



In their shareholder letter, Bruce Flatt emphasized targeting renewable energy investments, mainly with a the pitch of the new energy demand created by AI. They've secured significant contracts for energy infrastructure, including a deal with Microsoft for **10.5 GW** of power.



They're pursuing opportunities in nuclear energy – which I don't see too much of. They mention micro and small nuclear batteries & reactors. Which sounds smartty pants and I love it.



# Share Buybacks & Long-Term Value

I think they agree their stock is under-price and bought back $800M worth of shares. Not sure if that will continue because they may have brought the price back up to something like reasonable.



https://preview.redd.it/9pxvxhdu1uqd1.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=000e8da4e0aaa7e55031206bda9b8e42c3f22eb7



# Conclusion



I find the stock to be undervalued at current prices.

I think their growth looks promising and they will probably have some multiple expansion in the future.

On the downside, their business seems really complicated and maybe a bit too dependent on political sentiment of certain energy policies. I'm not sure if a very oil focused political regime would kill their margins or what.

3119,"Nations Royalty Corp. Shows Internal Confidence with Insider Buying, Focuses on Royalty Interests in Major Canadian Resource Projects, Fostering Indigenous Economic Growth","Nations Royalty Corp. (Ticker: NRC.v or NRYCF in the US) has garnered attention recently due to insider buying activity, signaling positive sentiment from within the company. 

https://preview.redd.it/qz3tud999uqd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e43be989bbfc6dc64fd59cb608d4204062746e

  
  


Nations Royalty partners with First Nations across Canada to secure royalty interests and income streams from major resource projects on their lands. The company’s focus on economic reconciliation and capacity building within Indigenous communities is central to its mission.



By involving these groups in public markets and resource developments, NRC aims to foster long-term economic growth for Indigenous partners while generating sustainable revenue.



Nations Royalty holds royalty interests in several notable resource projects, including the Brucejack Gold Mine, KSM Copper-Gold-Silver-Molybdenum Deposit, Premier Gold Project, Red Mountain Gold Deposit, and the Kitsault Molybdenum Deposit. These assets serve as the foundation for the company's long-term strategy.

Nations Royalty’s business model, combined with ongoing insider investment and a growing portfolio of resource projects, positions it as a key player in both the resource and Indigenous economic development sectors.



Over the past year, Nations Royalty’s Chief Investment Officer, Derrick Pattenden, made the largest insider purchase, investing CA$250,000 in shares at a price of CA$0.91 each. This was notably above the current share price of CA$0.76, suggesting optimism about the company’s long-term value. 



Over the last 12 months, there have been no insider sales, indicating that leadership is holding onto their shares. Furthermore, in the most recent quarter, insiders collectively invested an additional CA$54,000 in the company, adding to the confidence building around NRC’s prospects.



Insider ownership, an important indicator of alignment between company leadership and shareholders, shows that insiders hold CA$3.2 million worth of stock, representing 2.8% of the company, reflecting meaningful participation from the company's executives.

# Visa Gets Slapped with Antitrust Lawsuit

**What’s the Charge?** The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has Visa in its crosshairs, accusing the payment giant of illegally monopolizing the debit card market. According to the DOJ, Visa’s control over 60% of the $4 trillion debit transaction market has allowed them to bully merchants and tech rivals into submission. Think steep fees, restrictive contracts, and massive payouts to ensure no one else gets a slice of the pie.

**The Long Play:** This isn’t Visa’s first antitrust tango. The lawsuit follows a yearslong investigation that began after Visa tried to acquire fintech firm Plaid in 2021—a move the DOJ swiftly blocked. Visa’s alleged game plan? Pay off competitors like Apple, PayPal, and Block (formerly Square) to keep them from developing rival tech.

Attorney General Merrick Garland didn’t mince words: “Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing—but the price of nearly everything.”

**How’s Visa Feeling?** Visa’s General Counsel Julie Rottenberg fired back, calling the lawsuit “meritless” and reminding us all that Visa is just one player in a growing, competitive debit market. With a touch of PR spin, she added that Visa’s innovations help consumers—though, maybe not their wallets.

**Bigger Picture** This case is part of the Biden administration’s broader crackdown on industry giants that dominate markets. Visa’s been here before, but this time, the DOJ is coming for their debit throne. With over $7 billion in annual swipe fees on the line, Visa's legal defense is shaping up to be just as costly.

Meanwhile, Visa shares? Down 5%. 

If Visa loses, it could mean lower transaction fees for merchants and more competition in the payment space. But the fight won’t end anytime soon—expect this case to stretch over the next few years. And who knows, a new administration may have different ideas. Either way, Visa’s dominance might finally meet its match.

# Bank Of China’s Stimulus: Band-Aid on a Broken Leg

China just launched its biggest economic stimulus since the pandemic, and while it sent Chinese stocks soaring, it’s more of a temporary fix than a real solution. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut interest rates, loosened bank reserve requirements, and rolled out new housing incentives to give the economy a boost.

But here’s the problem: cheap credit alone won’t fix China’s deep-rooted economic issues.

**Stock Market Sugar Rush:** Let’s start with the bright spot—Chinese stocks had a stellar day. JD. com, Alibaba, and PDD Holdings (yep, Temu’s parent company) saw double-digit gains, lifting the CSI 300 index by 4.33%, its biggest surge in four years. Sounds promising, right? Well, hold up—despite that pop, the CSI 300 is still down around 1% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 21%. So while China’s market caught a break, Wall Street’s still winning the race.

**Property Market in Freefall:** The real issue here is China’s property market, which has gone from being a powerhouse to a sinkhole. Once accounting for a third of the economy, it’s now in a freefall, with prices continuing to drop and developers collapsing into bankruptcy. Beijing’s previous efforts to revive the market haven’t worked, and this latest push—lowering down payments on second homes to 15% and expanding loan guarantees—probably won’t either.

Here’s the kicker: only 11% of urban Chinese think home prices will rise next quarter. For context, that’s about as optimistic as expecting Blockbuster to make a comeback.

**Cheap Credit Won’t Cut It:** Sure, Beijing’s stimulus will provide a short-term jolt to stocks and housing, but it’s not a long-term fix. Throwing more credit at the economy won’t solve the underlying problem: a lack of private-sector innovation. Instead, the government is using financial tricks like subsidizing stock buybacks and offering cheap liquidity to institutional investors.

What China really needs is to loosen its grip on private businesses. But Xi Jinping’s ongoing crackdown on tech companies and private enterprises has left lasting scars. Until Beijing gives entrepreneurs the freedom to innovate, all this stimulus is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for another housing update tomorrow, this time with a focus on shiny new single-family homes. This report is key because it gives us a peek into how many homes were sold and at what price.

In July, new home sales hit 739,000, up 5.6% from the previous year, but economists expect August sales to cool off to around 700,000. One thing that probably won’t cool? Home prices. The median price for a new home spiked to $429,800 in July, a four-month high, and unless supply picks up, that number isn’t budging anytime soon.

# After Market Close:

* **Micron Technology** ($MU) might have cooled off since its peak in mid-June, but it's far from out of the game. The demand for its chips is still going strong, even if the buzz has quieted down, and the current dip in its stock price could be a prime value play. The consensus for the upcoming report? $1.13 in earnings per share and $7.63 billion in revenue.",1727220404,831490,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,5f8a16e0ba9d9f98f814b0ffffdde52706f61661e0e5a8d377237ee5e57038ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1foqhud/stock_market_today_visa_gets_slapped_with/

3125,Watchlist Update: The Pullback Happened as Expected + Institutional Support Under $1,"After the 24% move that $RNXT had last Friday, I anticipated a pullback and a potential bounce off the $1 support level. As expected, the stock pulled back into the $1.15 to $1 range, showing resilience at that critical support zone. What’s even more encouraging is that we saw institutional buying under $1, providing further confidence in the strength of this support level.

With solid volume still in play and institutional backing, $RNXT is setting up nicely for another potential run. I’m closely monitoring the price action to see if we can break back above key resistance levels and bounce here. Keep an eye on the volume and news developments as we move forward into the next weeks.

**Stop loss - 0.92** 

This is most likely a swing trade, so always have a stop loss, and this one is below the local low. If it were to get below .92, this would be very concerning. 

For those tracking this play, the next step is to monitor closely for a clean break above the short-term resistance levels. Should $RNXT break above $1.15, the stage could be set for another run, potentially retesting its recent highs or even moving further. Communicated Disclaimer this is NFA.

# Meta Connect 2024 — AR, Ray-Ban, and Quest 3S

Meta wrapped up its annual Connect 2024 event, and spoiler alert: the future is getting seriously techy. From AR glasses that might one day replace your phone to AI celebrities chatting in your DMs, here’s the breakdown of all things Meta.

***Orion AR Glasses*****: Your Phone’s Future Replacement?:** Mark Zuckerberg kicked things off with the *Orion AR glasses*, which may one day make you ditch your phone. These bad boys project holograms right into your eyes, letting you navigate the digital world without even lifting a finger.

# OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is leaving

After six-and-a-half years at OpenAI, CTO Mira Murati is stepping away. In a candid post on X (formerly Twitter), Murati said she’s taking time for “personal exploration.” But before she rides off into the sunset, her top priority is making sure the company transitions smoothly.

Murati, who led the development of ChatGPT and DALL-E, exits just ahead of OpenAI’s Dev Day conference—adding a bit of suspense to what’s already a high-stakes event.

**Big Shoes to Fill:** Murati’s departure is just the latest in a string of high-profile exits. Co-founders Ilya Sutskever and John Schulman, and Greg Brockman, have also left the company in recent months. While the details of Murati’s final day are still in the works, it’s clear her exit is shaking things up.

CEO Sam Altman didn’t hold back on praise, calling Murati’s contributions invaluable to both OpenAI’s mission and its internal culture. He teased that more details on the transition will be shared soon.

**OpenAI’s Next Move:** Murati’s exit couldn’t come at a more critical time. The company is in the middle of closing a $6.5 billion funding round, with backing from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, among others. Meanwhile, competitors like Google and Anthropic (founded by ex-OpenAI talent) are circling, each looking to outpace OpenAI in the AI arms race.

**End of an Era:** Though Murati’s next steps are still a mystery, one thing’s for sure: she’s left an indelible mark on OpenAI’s trajectory. As the company moves forward, it will be interesting to see how they fill her shoes and keep pushing the boundaries of AI innovation.

# Micron’s AI Glow-Up

Micron Technology ($MU) is having a moment. The chipmaker’s stock shot up 14% in after-hours trading, all thanks to the AI hype train. With revenue for the upcoming quarter projected to hit between $8.5 billion and $8.9 billion—way above Wall Street’s $8.3 billion estimate—Micron’s riding the AI wave hard.

What’s driving the surge? Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a must-have for training AI systems, is selling out faster than concert tickets. It’s giving Micron a serious edge in the AI arms race.

**Blowing Past Expectations:** Micron didn’t just meet expectations—it crushed them. Q4 revenue came in at $7.75 billion, up a jaw-dropping 93% from last year and beating the $7.66 billion forecast. Earnings per share? $1.18, leaving analysts’ $1.11 prediction in the dust.

With AI demand sky-high, Micron’s boosting prices and locking down contracts for 2024 and 2025. And with that kind of momentum, 2025 is looking like a good year to be in the memory chip game.

**AI’s New Best Friend:** Micron’s memory chips are the cool kids in AI town, making them a key partner for Nvidia ($NVDA) as companies pour billions into AI hardware. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra even said, “We’re entering 2025 with the best competitive positioning in Micron’s history.” Big words, but so far, they’re backing it up.

# Back in Business

After a slump in demand for smartphones and PCs, Micron’s bouncing back. These devices are on the up, and with AI becoming a standard feature, they’re going to need more memory chips.

Translation: Micron’s got a lot to look forward to. Investors are clearly on board, and if AI keeps driving demand, this stock may have even more room to run.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s action starts with the weekly jobless claims report, which has become the go-to indicator for anyone trying to guess the Fed’s next move. With inflation on the backburner for now, the focus has shifted to how the labor market is holding up as the Fed walks the tightrope between employment and price stability.

Also, we’ve got the second revision of Q2 GDP coming in hot. The first revision showed 3% growth, and while this update probably won’t shake things up, it’ll give us another snapshot of the economy as the Fed mulls over its next rate cut. Oh, and if that’s not enough Fed news for you, eight Fed officials—including Jerome Powell—are hitting the mic tomorrow. Expect plenty of clues about where interest rates are headed next.

3134,Is $MKL the Next Mini Berkshire Hathaway?,"I recently watched a fundamental analysis video on Daniel Pronk's channel of Markle Group ($MKL), where he compared it to an early Berkshire Hathaway. I would like to believe it. But for the past 5 years its regularly underperformed the S&P. 



Here are some key takeaways:

* Since IPO in 1986 at $753, $MKL has grown 200x. 
* Shareholder letter shows 21.6% return on their equity portfolio in 2023.
* Without saying it outright it's pretty obvious they consider themselves Buffet disciples. They're committed to allocating their free cashflow wherever they see the highest return. 



I think there's a pretty good chance the stock is undervalued. Maybe by 18-25% or something like that. 



Alright so here's what I don't get and would like to get an opinion on. 



The stock pretty consistently goes up over the long term. But for the past 5 years they've underperformed the S&P by about 55%. 



https://preview.redd.it/adt7cnby08rd1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee77544f12affc220862e9fb5b949071989e2108

I'm not really sure if the conclusion is that their stock price is suppressed compared to the S&P and might go up, If the S&P is actually the crazy one and it's actually good to see MKL basically keeping normal returns in an inflated stock market, or MKL growth is actually just not impressive and shouldn't keep paying attention to it.

3135,"NEXG.v Expands Exploration at Goliath Gold Complex After Positive Spring Program Results, Including 15.70 g/t Au over 0.75m","NexGold Mining Corp. (Ticker: NEXG.v, NXGCF for US investors) is a Canadian-focused gold exploration company, with its primary asset being the Goliath Gold Complex located in Northwestern Ontario.

The Goliath Gold Complex comprises the Goliath, Goldlund, and Miller deposits, benefiting from convenient access to critical infrastructure such as the Trans-Canada Highway, along with established power and rail connections.

https://preview.redd.it/sxi4qxf9j8rd1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=baef7b5f47f39992e69de0ad7a14d4bc40c1d4be

Recently, NexGold reported impressive outcomes from its spring 2024 exploration program and has commenced an expanded exploration initiative at the Goliath Complex.

The spring program, launched in May, included a variety of exploration activities such as prospecting, geological mapping, channel sampling, and soil geochemistry across high-priority targets. Sampling results highlights include:

* 7.13 g/t Au over 2.00m, including 15.70 g/t Au over 0.75m
* 3.18 g/t Au over 2.68m, including 7.53 g/t Au over 0.78m
* 5.10 g/t Au over 0.52m
* 5.09 g/t Au over 0.47m

These encouraging results indicate the potential of a more expansive mineralized system, reinforcing the possibility of additional discoveries as NexGold continues its 25,000-meter drilling campaign.

With these results in mind, NexGold has expanded its exploration to the northeastern part of the project's Goldlund claim block, a region that has seen limited prior activity. This phase involves deploying an enhanced prospecting team and initiating new soil geochemistry grids.

This exploration expansion is a crucial step in NexGold's broader strategy to advance its projects, improve geological understanding, and identify new drilling targets to fuel growth at the Goliath Gold Complex.

# Super Micro’s Big Plunge

On Thursday, Super Micro Computer shares nosedived 12%, all thanks to *The Wall Street Journal* breaking the news that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the company. The probe? Allegations from a former employee that the company has been playing loose with its accounting books.

It’s not the kind of headline you want when your stock is riding high on AI demand.

**Accounting Drama, Round Two**  
This isn’t Super Micro’s first time facing financial scrutiny. In 2020, the company settled a $17.5 million case with the SEC over accounting issues. But now, whistleblower Bob Luong claims the server maker overstated revenue—and short-seller Hindenburg Research jumped right in with a report highlighting ""glaring accounting red flags.""

Hindenburg also pointed to other concerns, including undisclosed related-party transactions and export control failures. The new DOJ inquiry just adds to the pressure.

**AI Boom Meets Legal Gloom**  
Super Micro had been riding the AI wave like a pro, with their servers powering the needs of giants like Nvidia and Meta. The stock was up 42% this year before Thursday's bad news.

Now, with the DOJ in the picture, the company’s glowing reputation has taken a hit—even as CEO Charles Liang assures customers that their AI-driven business remains as strong as ever.

**Investors Hit the Pause Button**  
Despite Liang's statement dismissing the Hindenburg report as “inaccurate,” the damage was done. Shares dropped to $373 before rebounding slightly to finish the day around $400.

While analysts are divided, with some halving their price targets and others seeing potential for recovery, the DOJ probe has definitely left investors rethinking their enthusiasm.

# Costco Reports Strong Profit Ahead of Holiday Season

Costco reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter, with a solid $5.29 per share, beating analyst predictions. Shopper traffic increased across the U.S., though visitors tightened their belts a bit, spending slightly less per trip. Still, paid memberships rose, and about 90% of members renewed. While revenue came in slightly below estimates at $79.7 billion (vs. $79.96 billion), the wholesale giant’s ability to keep shoppers spending despite economic headwinds proves it’s still got the magic touch.

But it wasn’t just foot traffic keeping Costco afloat.

**Non-Food Sales Surge**  
The retailer saw strong growth in its non-food items, with online sales surging by nearly 19%. From home furnishings to gift cards, Costco’s e-commerce arm, under new leadership, is flourishing. Gold bullion and appliances were also standout performers, proving that customers are venturing beyond the grocery aisles.

Memberships continue to be a key revenue driver.

**Membership Boost on the Horizon**  
Costco recently hiked its membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, setting the stage for future revenue growth. Right now, Executive members make up almost half of all paid sign-ups, and membership fee income hit $1.51 billion for the quarter. While a slight miss compared to analyst expectations, the higher fees will show up in the next earnings cycle.

As for Costco’s competitors, it’s clear who’s winning.

**Leading the Retail Pack**  
While Walmart and Target saw mixed results, Costco continues to gain market share, especially in the e-commerce space. Consumers are leaning into the value Costco offers, with its private-label Kirkland Signature brand boosting loyalty. Even with economic uncertainty, Costco’s strong positioning keeps it ahead of the curve.

Investors are keeping a close eye on holiday projections.

# Harris vs. Trump — 2024 Economic Policies

With the election in full swing, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have locked in on a key issue: saving the American middle class. Both candidates are unveiling ambitious economic plans in crucial swing states, hoping to win over voters. Harris’s “opportunity economy” focuses on future industries like AI and biotech, while Trump is banking on tariffs to “rescue” the middle class.

Their strategies signal a high-stakes competition for votes.

**Tariffs vs. Tech: Competing Visions**  
Trump took the stage in Savannah this week, praising tariffs as “one of the most beautiful words.” His solution? Slap new tariffs on companies that manufacture abroad, encouraging businesses to shift production back to the U.S.

Meanwhile, Harris delivered her pitch in Pittsburgh, pledging to outcompete China in industries like biotech, clean energy, and blockchain. She’s promising to strengthen America’s industrial policy and ensure the U.S. leads in key sectors.

Both candidates are betting big on manufacturing, but they might be missing the bigger picture.

**Swing States, High Stakes**  
In states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, the candidates are focusing on union-friendly voters. Manufacturing jobs are a big talking point, but there’s a catch—manufacturing only makes up 10% of Pennsylvania’s workforce. The U.S. economy is increasingly service-driven, accounting for over 70% of its value.

Focusing too much on manufacturing may leave the broader economy overlooked.

**The Middle-Class Mirage**  
Harris and Trump may be selling visions of a middle-class revival, but delivering on these promises is a different story. Harris’s high-tech focus may not trickle down to everyday workers, while Trump’s tariffs could raise prices for consumers.

Both candidates are pulling out all the stops—but can they truly deliver?

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index—aka PCE, for those in the know—still reigns supreme as the Fed’s favorite inflation tracker. But honestly, does inflation even matter anymore?

Recently, the Fed’s been way more into the other side of its job: employment. A shaky labor market had investors sweating in August, and the stock market definitely felt it. While things have calmed down, reports like this week’s consumer confidence survey show that job worries are still hanging around.

But don’t get it twisted—inflation’s still on the Fed’s radar. Central bankers, in their speeches this week, made it crystal clear they’re keeping a close watch on rising prices, especially the core PCE (the one that skips food and energy).

Tomorrow’s PCE report is expected to show a tiny 0.10% rise for August, down from July’s 0.16%. But if that slowdown doesn’t show up, expect plenty of chatter about what it means for the Fed’s upcoming rate cut decisions. ",1727394386,831537,Virtual_Information3,t2_9z83wo3n,57c3ee697caf215d00dca0017b6d0cfe7343c9dbf1d222f55b7e713a07bc5942,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1fqagvq/stock_market_today_smci_takes_a_big_plunge_costco/

3145,"OCG.v to Raise $5M for Exploration & Development of its High-Grade Santa Ana Silver Project with Billionaire Eric Sprott Fully Subscribing, Sprott Doubles Down by Exercising $2M of his OCG Warrants ","Outcrop Silver & Gold Corporation (TSXV: OCG) (OTCQX: OCGSF) is an explorer and developer focused on advancing the high-grade Santa Ana silver project in Colombia. The Santa Ana project, covering 27,000 hectares in the Mariquita District, is situated in Colombia’s largest primary silver district, with mining records dating back to 1585.

The company's 2023 NI 43-101 Technical Report outlines an indicated resource of 24.2 million ounces of silver equivalent at a grade of 614 g/t, and an inferred resource of 13.5 million ounces at 435 g/t at the project.



These resources are spread across seven major vein systems, including Santa Ana, La Porfia, El Dorado, and Paraiso, with extensive mineralization along a 30-kilometer strike.



Outcrop Silver's ongoing 2024 drilling campaign targets the expansion of known mineralization and exploration of new high-potential areas.



Recent drill results from the Aguilar vein system included intercepts of 1.3 meters at 888 g/t silver equivalent and 0.30 meters at 3,043 g/t silver, confirming the continuity of high-grade mineralization along a 1.5-kilometer strike.



Outcrop Silver announced a $5 million non-brokered private placement, fully subscribed by Eric Sprott. The proceeds will fund further exploration and development at Santa Ana. The same day, Sprott exercised 10,000,000 warrants, investing an additional $2 million and increasing his stake in Outcrop Silver to 13.3%.



These developments highlight Outcrop Silver’s strategic focus on unlocking value at the Santa Ana project, while Sprott’s increased investment underscores his confidence in the company's potential for long-term growth.

# OpenAI’s New “Model”: From Non-Profit to For-Profit 

Big changes are underway at OpenAI, with whispers of the AI giant switching from nonprofit roots to a for-profit model. The twist? CEO Sam Altman might be grabbing a 7% equity stake in the revamped structure, a move that could net him around $10 billion. Not bad for a company that started with a mission to save humanity, not chase profits.

As OpenAI’s valuation skyrockets past $150 billion, the move to a public-benefit corporation signals a new era, one that’s sure to catch the attention of investors—and maybe a few critics.

Tech just got a little more lucrative.

**A Shaky Foundation**  
Amid all the excitement, there’s been a surprising exodus of top talent. CTO Mira Murati, a key player in the development of ChatGPT, just announced her departure, joining a growing list of execs heading for the exits. Bob McGrew, chief research officer, and Barret Zoph, VP of research, are also packing their bags.

The leadership vacuum at OpenAI is starting to feel like a Game of Thrones episode.

**All Eyes on Altman**  
Despite the departures, Altman seems unfazed. He’s been busy reassuring employees that the leadership shake-up is just part of OpenAI’s growing pains. His focus? Getting back into the technical trenches after spending most of his time with investors and political leaders over the past year.

“Leadership changes are natural,” Altman says, but OpenAI is definitely not your average company.

**Investors Smell Opportunity**  
OpenAI’s pivot is already attracting deep-pocketed backers like Microsoft and Nvidia, as the company raises $6.5 billion in fresh funding. The new structure will make it even more attractive to investors, who won’t face the previous cap on their returns. In other words, it's time to get those checkbooks ready.

Profit margins are up; altruism might be down.

# Google Paid $2.7 Billion to Bring Back an AI Genius

In a move that screams ""AI arms race,"" Google has forked out a jaw-dropping $2.7 billion to bring back Noam Shazeer, a co-author of the research that kickstarted the AI boom. Officially, the payment was to license technology from his startup, Character. AI, but insiders know the truth: Google wanted its AI prodigy back on the team.

Shazeer didn’t sell his company or take it public, yet he’s walking away with hundreds of millions and a shiny new title: VP at Google. His task? Lead the charge on Gemini, Google’s next-gen AI project aimed at outpacing rivals like OpenAI. It’s a wild return for someone who once left in frustration over Google’s risk-averse approach to AI.

When you're this valuable, a $2.7 billion price tag barely raises eyebrows.

**The Road to $2.7B**  
Shazeer left Google in 2021 after the company refused to release a chatbot he created with colleague Daniel De Freitas. That chatbot, Meena, had serious potential—Shazeer predicted it could one day replace Google Search and bring in trillions. But Google wasn’t ready to take the leap, citing safety concerns. Frustrated, Shazeer walked and launched Character. AI.

Character. AI took off quickly, raising $150 million and hitting a $1 billion valuation. Its niche? Chatbots that mimic everyone from celebrities to fictional characters. But despite the hype, revenue struggles and steep development costs began to weigh on the startup. Enter Google with a multi-billion-dollar licensing deal and a way to bring Shazeer (and his team) back into the fold.

Google’s spending spree shows they’re playing the long game in AI.

**The AI Talent Wars**  
Shazeer isn’t just any engineer—he’s the guy behind the 2017 paper ""Attention is All You Need,"" the foundation of today’s generative AI models. And in the current AI arms race, top talent is more valuable than ever. With rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft snatching up the best and brightest, Google’s willing to spend big to stay in the game.

Now back at Google, Shazeer is one of three leaders working on Gemini, a project set to rival ChatGPT and take Google’s AI ambitions to new heights.

When the competition’s this fierce, you do what it takes to win—$2.7 billion and all.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week is all about job reports on repeat. First up is Tuesday’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, then Wednesday rolls in with the ADP employment report, Thursday brings the usual jobless claims, and the big finale? Friday’s US employment report.

All eyes are on these numbers as the Fed weighs its next move. With inflation cooling off, the job market is the wildcard. If the data shows the labor market is still strong, expect a more cautious rate cut. But if hiring cools, Jerome Powell and crew might opt for something bigger.

3156,Soon uranium spot & LT price break out: 2 triggers + LT uranium supply contracts signed now with 80-85USD/lb floor & 125-130USD/lb ceiling escalated to inflation + additional uranium production cuts,"Hi everyone,

**A. 2 triggers (=> Break out starting this week imo)**

a) This week (October 1st) the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.

With all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.

b) The last \~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.

Now there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying

The upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly

**B. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster next week with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher compared to the outdated 81 USD/lb

Although the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.

Here the evolution of the LT uranium price:

[Source: Cameco](https://preview.redd.it/vtosjgljuxrd1.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc76baeceebbab571bdcf98e44fd111ffb775366)

The global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!

[Source: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world](https://preview.redd.it/uv4i0mnmuxrd1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=77114f85eae1c076e64a51d27b66ff60257976d5)

During the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.

In the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price

The official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.

**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**

=> an average of 105 USD/lb

While the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb

By consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster next week with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher compared to the outdated 81 USD/lb

Will we see a jump (+1.50) to the average price of the 80-85 USD/lb floor used in the contracts being signed in September?

Or will it already be a bigger jump (+2.50, +3.00, +4.00)?

We will know on Tuesday.

**C. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a couple days ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders are frontrunning the 2 triggers starting this week)**

Uranium spotprice increase on Thursday:

Here is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning and before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers:

**D. Uranium mining is hard!**

UR-Energy: The production of uranium in restarting deposits is fraught with difficulties and challenges. Future production will fall short of what the market discounts as certain. Just an example, URG's production will be 43% lower than its first 1Q2024 guidance

[Source: UR-Energy](https://preview.redd.it/h9xnuf80vxrd1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe62a537b6f72b13256b00947c4d590209faeac8)

Me: The available alternatives: deliverying less uranium to the clients than previously promised or buying uranium in spot

But URG is not alone!

Kazakhstan did 17% cut for their promised uranium production2025 + lower production than expected in 2026 and beyond!

[The Financial Times](https://preview.redd.it/srvjntu2vxrd1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6b97d7ea2716a1003fb01a779d977e4ced76f20)

Langer Heinrich too! \~2.5Mlb production in 2024, in2023 they promised 3.2Mlb for 2024

Dasa delayed by 1y (>4Mlb less for 2025), Phoenix by 2y

Peninsula Energy planned to start production end 2023, but with what UEC dis to PEN, the production of PEN was delayed by a year => Again less pounds in 2024 than initially expected. Peninsula Energy is in the process to restart ISR production end this year...

My previous post going more in detail on the uranium supply issues: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1flaviu/a\_structural\_deficit\_and\_additional\_production/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1flaviu/a_structural_deficit_and_additional_production/)

**C. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The uranium LT price at 81 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last 3 trading days.

Uranium spotprice is now at 81.88 USD/lb

A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.32 CAD/share or 20.22 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 81.88 USD/lb

For instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.

An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.50 USD/sh.

And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.

**D.** **A couple uranium sector ETF's**:

* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector
* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector
* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector

3157,Six key September market updates to understand before next month + Two swing trades looking ahead,"Good morning everyone! I compiled a quick summary of some significant market events so people can be in tune with the markets as they prepare for next month. I don’t know about you, but even with all of this uncertainty right now, I still think that index have a couple more all-time highs in 2024.  I know it is a very brief summary, but I wanted to save you time when reading this post. Hope this post is informative, and let me know if you are as bullish as I am!

1. **Federal Reserve and Interest Rates**: The Federal Reserve held its policy meeting and decided to leave interest rates unchanged. However, the Fed signaled that another rate hike is likely before the end of the year. This hawkish stance led to heightened market volatility as investors recalibrated expectations about the future path of interest rates.
2. **Bond Yields:** Treasury yields surged to multi-year highs during September, with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching levels not seen since 2007. Higher yields weighed on equity markets, particularly growth stocks, as investors considered the impact of potentially sustained high rates on corporate borrowing costs and valuations.
3. **Stock Market Performance:** The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had a mixed month, with heightened volatility driven by concerns over rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Technology and growth sectors were especially sensitive to rate fluctuations, while energy stocks saw gains due to rising oil prices.
4. **Oil Prices Rally:** Crude oil prices rallied significantly in September, driven by supply constraints from major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as resilient demand. WTI crude surpassed $90 per barrel, contributing to a rally in energy stocks and raising concerns about inflationary pressures.
5. **Economic Data:** Key economic data released in September showed mixed signals:
   1. Inflation: The August Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed an increase, primarily driven by higher energy prices, but core inflation showed a moderate trend.
   2. Employment: The U.S. labor market remained relatively strong, with job openings staying high, although a slight increase in unemployment claims indicated some softness in the job market.
   3. Consumer Confidence: Consumer confidence dipped, reflecting concerns over inflation and the broader economic outlook.
6. **Government Shutdown Concerns:** Towards the end of the month, fears of a potential U.S. government shutdown increased as Congress struggled to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. This added additional uncertainty to the markets, contributing to risk-off sentiment.  

**Here are the the swing trade ideas! Definitely worth a look!** 

**$RNXT - Trade Strategy: Long Position**

* Entry Price: $1.10 (upon breakout above the descending trendline)
* Exit Price: Target at $1.40
* Stop Loss: $0.92

Quick Summary: The stock appears to be forming a descending triangle pattern, and it is currently testing a critical resistance area defined by the downward-sloping trendline. A break above $1.10 would indicate a potential trend reversal, making it a good entry for a long position, with an initial target around $1.40, which corresponds to prior resistance levels.

**Support Level:** There is a ton of support at a $1. I would be shocked to see my stop loss hit, but nothing is ever certain in the stock market!  


**$PLUG Trade Strategy: Long Position**

* Entry Price: $2.40 (upon breakout above the descending trendline)
* Exit Price: Target at $3.00
* Stop Loss: $1.95

Quick Summary: Plug Power is consolidating near the base of a descending wedge pattern, showing potential for a bullish breakout above the $2.40 level. With a positive MACD crossover signaling a momentum shift, an entry upon the breakout could see a move towards $3.00, which coincides with a recent resistance area.

**Confidence Level**: Moderate, pending confirmation of the breakout.

* US stocks wrapped up the month and quarter with fresh records after Fed Chair Jerome Powell assured investors he’s got the economy’s back—but don’t expect him to rush those rate cuts. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to a new high, while the Nasdaq gained 0.38%, and the Dow barely edged up but still managed a record close.
* Markets were a bit wobbly after Powell’s remarks, but stocks rallied into the close. Powell hinted at more rate cuts down the road but made it clear he’s not on a set schedule. Despite his cautious tone, the S&P 500 capped off the quarter with a hefty $2.5 trillion rally.

# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Futu Holdings** ($FUTU) surged 11.64% as China stocks rallied on Monday to their best day in 16 years, fueled by recent economic stimulus that sparked investor optimism. U.S.-listed China-related stocks and ETFs followed suit.

# DirecTV scoops up Dish for $1

After two decades of on-again, off-again talks, DirecTV and Dish are finally tying the knot. DirecTV will scoop up Dish for a jaw-dropping $1 (yep, that’s not a typo) and inherit a not-so-sweet $9.75 billion in debt. Why the big move? They’re hoping a combined front will help them survive the ruthless streaming wars.

Streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon have slashed into satellite TV’s customer base, leaving DirecTV and Dish clinging to shrinking market share. Together, the companies have lost over 60% of their subscribers since 2016. 

**AT&T Waves Goodbye**  
AT&T, once DirecTV’s proud parent, is making a clean break. The telecom giant is offloading its remaining 70% stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG for a cool $7.6 billion, officially kissing the media world goodbye. Remember, this is the same company that spent a whopping $48.5 billion to buy DirecTV back in 2015. Oh, how times change.

For AT&T, this deal is part of its grand strategy to refocus on cellphones and broadband, leaving the Hollywood dreams behind. Shareholders are crossing their fingers for a bigger dividend payout from that fresh cash infusion.

**Debt, Bondholders, and Red Tape, Oh My!**  
Not so fast—this deal isn’t set in stone yet. Dish’s bondholders will have to agree to write off $1.57 billion of debt, and the whole operation still needs the green light from regulators. But with streaming services gobbling up the market, industry insiders are hopeful the merger will slide through without too much fuss.

If it all goes according to plan, the merger could give the new mega-company more muscle to negotiate with content creators like Disney and Warner Bros. A little bargaining power never hurt anyone.

**The Endgame**  
The new DirecTV-Dish combo will boast around 18 million subscribers, making it the biggest pay-TV provider in the U.S. But let’s be real—that’s still a sinking ship. Cord-cutting isn’t slowing down, and satellite TV feels a bit... 2005.

Still, by teaming up, the two hope they can scrape by with fewer costs and a stronger negotiating hand. Survival of the fittest, right?

The question remains: Can a revamped satellite service stay relevant in a world where everyone’s streaming? Only time—and your Netflix subscription—will tell.

# Powell Signals Rate Cuts Ahead, But “No Hurry”

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell isn’t in a rush to cut rates. While the Fed plans to lower interest rates ""over time,"" Powell emphasized that decisions will be made cautiously and based on incoming data. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, he reiterated that the economy is holding strong, but rate cuts will be gradual.

The Fed’s strategy? Slow and steady wins the race, with no fixed game plan.

**Inflation: Job’s Not Finished Yet**  
Powell reminded everyone that while inflation has eased, tapping into his inner Kobe, the job isn’t finished. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.2% over the past year, which is a good sign, but not quite where they want it. Powell's taking a measured approach, determined not to let inflation make a comeback.

The bottom line: they’ll keep fighting inflation until it’s fully under control.

**Labor Market: Cooling Off, but Still Strong**  
On the employment front, the labor market remains solid but has cooled compared to last year. Powell noted that job conditions don’t need to weaken further to reach inflation goals, which is good news for anyone fearing a spike in unemployment.

Economists predict 150,000 new jobs were added in September—slower growth, but still steady.

**Looking Ahead**  
Powell hinted at two more quarter-point rate cuts this year, but the Fed is keeping its options open. If the economy performs better or worse than expected, those plans could change. Flexibility is the name of the game.

The Fed’s ultimate goal? A soft landing where inflation falls, and the economy keeps chugging along—without any sharp jolts. Powell’s in no rush, but he’s keeping his eyes on the prize.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is all about labor market data, kicking off tomorrow with the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). This report covers the essentials: how many jobs are open, how many people are getting hired, and how many are calling it quits.

The numbers will give the Fed some ammo for its next rate cut decision. Last month, we saw 7.7 million job openings, a slight dip from July, with hiring and quitting basically flat. Economists are predicting another small drop to 7.64 million—if it drops more, get ready for chatter about a labor market slowdown.

But that’s not all. We’re also getting US PMI, ISM Manufacturing, and Construction Spending reports tomorrow, offering a broader look at how the economy’s holding up.

# Before Market Open:

* **McCormick & Company** ($MKC) might not be the hottest stock around, but it’s as steady as they come. The spice giant dominates the seasoning world, but investors should keep an eye on its profitability. Despite ruling the spice aisle, McCormick has a surprisingly hard time turning that market power into serious cash. Consensus? $0.67 EPS and $1.67 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Nike** ($NKE) has been stumbling lately. A tough Bloomberg piece recently put CEO John Donahoe in the hot seat, and now he’s out, replaced by Elliott Hill—who, by the way, has a pretty killer LinkedIn resume. Hill’s got a lot on his plate, though, and investors will be looking for his game plan to turn Nike’s fortunes around.
