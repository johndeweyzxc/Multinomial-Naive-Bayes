How exactly? 

How can you be prepared for two opposite things at the same time? How can you spread the message that somehow you’ll gain no matter what direction the market takes?
 You either place your investments thinking the market will go up or thinking it will go down. Betting on both scenarios is like going to the roulette and betting both black and red. 
It just makes no sense. 

So dont get brainwashed with hyped videos and such, zoom out and move accordingly to your original strategy.
Only time will tell us who’s gonna be right, definitely not youtubers and definitely not by confusing people with silly nonsense and illogical thoughts. The goal for them is to make you believe they were always right, so no matter what happens they can say “we did predicted in our channel and we were fine anyways”

54,Would Spot BTC ETF be approved by the SEC?,"It's no longer news that traders/investors, alongside firms like BlackRock and Grayscale, are eager for the approval of the spot BTC ETF. They believe that its approval would not only foster crypto adoption but also boost the potential of the crypto market.

After much debate with the SEC regarding the approval of the spot BTC ETF, the decision date is drawing nearer. There have been both positive and negative news surrounding this topic, although the former seems to be more prevalent, which is a relief at the moment. According to news on CMC, the BTC price has bounced back from a slight dip, which was rumored to be connected to the SEC's intention to not approve the spot ETF. However, recent meetings involving the SEC, BlackRock, and Nasdaq hint at the approval of the spot BTC ETFs.

This sentiment is supported by a statement made by senior crypto journalist Jacquelyn Melinek in Techrunch. She states that the spot BTC ETF is going to be approved by the SEC for multiple firms' applications, citing sources extremely close to the matter. Bloomberg analyst James Styffat predicts a 90% chance of the SEC approving the proposal. He believes that the SEC's options are limited following a legal defeat against Grayscale and ongoing pressure, and the cautious approach of institutional investors may lead to the gradual adoption of the ETF. Additionally, global inflation showing signs of receding may force central banks to consider rate cuts.

Based on the reasons mentioned above, the chances of approving the Spot BTC ETF are high. However, it's important to note that regulatory decisions can be unpredictable. It's advisable to stay updated on the latest news and developments in this regard and I've decided to be careful with my funds opting for investment products like copy-trading and/or bot trading as better alternatives in the meantime.

68,Does Bitcoin ETF approval signals the Bull-run?,"With US SEC set to approve spot Bitcoin ETF applications from financial giants like Blackrock, Fidelity, Greyscale etc., trillions is expected to flow into this industry and this has sparked mixed feeling among analyst. Gabor Gurbacs, a director at VanEck, recently agreed that while a spot ETF will create ""trillions in value"" he advised people not to “overestimate the initial impact of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs”, Some analyst claimed that the approval will require ETF issuers to purchase tens of billions dollars of bitcoin to satisfy the institutional demand, leading to a radical shift in the supply and demand dynamics.  

With so many Bitcoin whales already holding their coin in their personal wallet signals that they're less inclined to sell which could increase scarcity and impact positively on price. Although, CryptoQuant and QCP Capital suggest that BTC will dip as low as $32,000 due to the amount of unrealized profits in the market and sell the news scenario demand for ETFs. 

We have witness BTC rally over 61% since October due to the expectation of SEC approval of one or more of the spot ETF applications. This expectations keep growing stronger and with final BTC ETF application filling being posted by major US exchanges, many analyst are confident that SEC will approve the first US spot Bitcoin ETF soon. 

We have also seen exchanges launched events to encourage users to trade BTC as we near spot ETF approval, this confirm the impact of the ETF approval and the readiness of exchanges but does this approval signals the bull-run? What do you expect after the approval?",1704614981,383076,Donsaudi29,t2_rznelnyu,1e4967df21c77f88924b3b141022557db2c63790fe89535cd96b373c7a0dfa6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/190ncye/does_bitcoin_etf_approval_signals_the_bullrun/

114,What do you make of Gary Gensler and SEC Warning against investing in Crypto as BTC ETF Approval Looms?,"It is obvious that Crypto is winning the battle against SEC as there are high expectations on a possible spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Many exchanges, enthusiast and analysts are counting down to tomorrow (10/01/2024) as we await a response from the US SEC. Recently, Gary Gensler has turn to crypto adviser on X by tweeting advise to investors, encouraging investors not to FOMO or invest in crypto. Some crypto ethusisast on X claim this approach is his last draw of the straw in an attempt to discourage people since the approval is inevitable.  

US SEC investor ED recently took to their X handle to advice investors to Say **“NO TO FOMO”** they further advised that “Just because others might buy a particular investment, doesn’t mean it’s the right opportunity for you”. Does this means that the approval is imminent? 

We know that SEC could still deny the application but they would need to do so with a valid reason different from the previous ones. Remember in August, a federal judge ordered the SEC to revisit a spot BTC ETF application from Grayscale claiming the commission was “arbitrary and capricious” in denying the investment vehicle. 

Do you see SEC and Gary recent turn leaf as an indicator for the approval?",1704828603,383297,Donsaudi29,t2_rznelnyu,c0321553a2f9249994527b3d5d47705bf32f662c685a0ca7ff829446bd924e8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/192n7dl/what_do_you_make_of_gary_gensler_and_sec_warning/

161,"If you are still using Coinbase, read this.","Today when Solana went down about 7%, I tried to withdraw my SOL from Coinbase to Solflare. I did this because CB charges outrageous fees for buying and selling and I would much rather use Solflare and Jupiter (Jup.ag) so that I can actually make a profit sometimes. Coinbase did not send my crypto, my SOL or my USDC, then they claimed I had to confirm my identity to remove my crypto. I confirmed my ID several times for each transaction, they denied it when it was obviously me and they had just accepted an ID check 3 days prior. 

I went to support about it and they literally would not release my crypto to me until SOL went back up and I no longer had the chance to buy it at a good enough price without their exorbitant fee. They said that they couldn't send it because the ""network was too clogged and I would get the money when it unclogged.""

I now realize that until my crypto leaves CB... it's not mine. I suspect what happened is that CB actually meant that they did not have enough money to give me back my crypto until the market went back up. 

Lesson learned, if you are still using CB, do yourself a favor and get your crypto out as soon as you can, because I suspect CB is having more money troubles than they are letting on. Not my keys, not my crypto.",1705133361,383488,Revolutionary_Tea159,t2_93pcbozo,2a7642e0fc30094c798ab6c8fb9c05b9e9bd6861547eb97703b2dbf1d3688929,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/195j5ku/if_you_are_still_using_coinbase_read_this/

164,Day 3 after BTC spot ETF listing; not the market we expected?,"Before the approval of the BTC spot ETF by SEC, everyone in the crypto space was expecting a bull run hinging their expectations on the wider adoption of BTC and the asset being in high demand leading to a hike in price. But little did we know that institutional owners and big whales have already transferred a lot of these BTC holdings to their wallets waiting for the listing to sell off for a profit. With Coinbase serving as asset custody for about 90% of listing institution, there was always a pointer that market could dump depending on the activities of whales on the exchange and at this rate the exchange could run out of their BTC reserve if demands and sales continues at this rate tho. That didn't disappoint either as reported BTC sales after 24 hours of BTC spot ETF going live for the approved 11 trading firm, stood at $7B. That alone is enough to cause a major dump in the price of BTC as witnessed yesterday.

Although most analyst are of the opinion that this is expected and that as soon as the volume of ETF trades increases tremendously and demand is on the high, institution will still need to acquire more BTC to seed with their product leading to a spike in price of the asset. Also, with the halving less than 100 days from now, there's belief that supply may dry up and inevitably result in another bull since the buy pressure will be 2-way - one from the ETF offering institutions and from the crypto buyers needing for other usecases.

But another interesting theory to the drop in price is that analyst are of the view that most BTC holders are shifting funds from BTC to ETH further explaining why the Ethereum ecosystem is buzzing atm with a spike in price to \~$2,700 earlier today. A lot of tokens in the ecosystem have witnessed a price jump especially METIS, ARB and OP.

But all these begs the question, ""what is the appropriate action right now?"". Some crypto experts are saying trading is the best play rn while some believe it the right time to buy the dip. What is your take?",1705154368,383498,Bashir_Jasper03,t2_r89peote,efe4352abf73ab142661a000cfdebfa5e0109695efb95d744e6f1abfdead4403,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/195olo9/day_3_after_btc_spot_etf_listing_not_the_market/

But wait, what if a relaxed and more strategic discussion far away in middle east, Europe or South East Asia can change the game pretty earlier than just focusing on BTC spot ETF.

1. Web3 Hub Davos 2024: this is going to be the first event in 2024 holding from January 15 to 18 in Switzerland. This event usually consist of roundtable discussions, keynote speeches, fireside chats, panel discussions and more. It has the reputation of attracting C-level executives from the blockchain, crypto and web3 space with this year's event already expecting execs from HEDERA, Circle, Bitcoin Suisse, NEAR, JP Morgan, YGG, Bitget and many more in the web3 and crypto industry to discuss new path, innovations and web3 adoption.
2. Fintech India Expo 2024: This event includes insightful discussions on various topics such as blockchain, cyber security, digital banking, and more. It will be holding from January 17 - 19 in New Delhi. 
3. WFC Fintech 2024: this event is going to be held at the Pullman Dubai Creek City Center in  Dubai from 24 Jan to 25 Jan in 2024. The primary objective of this event  is to connect visionaries, industry leaders, and businessmen and share  their wisdom. Being a hub for international fintech innovation, WFC aims  to explore trends in blockchain, AI, cybersecurity, and more.

TitanX is a DeFi ecosystem that offers various services such as launchpad, exchange, NFT, gaming, staking, and more. 
Its main goals are to reduce token supply, increase demand through smart contracts, and drive demand using game theory mechanics.
TitanX is designed as a leverage play on the value of Ethereum  with its value tied to the growth of ETH as it becomes more expensive and globally adopted.

The mining process for TitanX becomes increasingly challenging and expensive over time, requiring more resources and effort to mine or produce new tokens. The value of TitanX is tied to the increasing value and adoption of ETH globally, meaning that as ETH becomes more expensive and widely used, the value of TitanX is expected to also increase.

The mining process for TitanX becomes progressively more challenging and expensive over time, requiring more resources and effort to mine or produce new tokens. TitanX is designed to benefit from the growth and value of Ethereum, as its own value is tied to ETH's increasing adoption. However, mining new TitanX tokens becomes increasingly difficult and costly over time.

This is a short POV of why solordi's gonna hit a higher ATH or 5-20m mc in the future.

You can decide for yourself after you hear his first twitter space  
There will be another Space this coming Saturday and it will be filled by Key Opinion Leaders.

There is an early news that gotbit already invested on Solordi and it's a matter of time before they announce it.  
Gotbit's partner had been a catalyst for a project's success/pump or recognition of a legit project as they are the market maker of BONK, ANALOS, MYRO, and more. I mean it's not a 100% success but you can picture a 700k market cap has a lot of gain compared to those 3 which the ranging from 170m mc. The World's First Bitcoin Ordinal + BRC-20 Inscription Dog Coin on Solana. They are building an ecosystem of products… not just another meme

Gotbit followed them:  


DOGE $1 started on supporting us and it will run on a week, maybe more  
$doge army is pretty strong

&#x200B;

The list goes on but what I really love about this project is it's not just a MEME. The developers are not your typical pump-and-dump. They really are building a utility.

CMC and CEXs are also on the way.

The World's First Bitcoin Ordinal + BRC-20 Inscription Dog Coin on Solana. They are building an ecosystem of products… not just another meme

Chinese friends starting to support us two. 2 or more chinese whale TGs gonna be supporting $solo

330,Do you still believe in Buy the FUD and sell the News?,"The buzz and hype of BTC spot ETF approval is finally down on us and I don’t think most crypto newbies and few expert expect the current dip. It was anticipated that the approval will send BTC to $50k and above but after the approval they was huge selling that force BTC below $40k. Anyway as usual this industry is still young as such we keep learning daily.  

Don’t forget that CryptoQuant and QCP Capital predicted BTC will dip as low as $32,000 due to the amount of unrealized profits in the market and sell the news scenario demand for the ETFs could this prediction really come to past?   One factor I am most fascinated to witness is CryptoQuant prediction that BTC will retest its previous ATH before next halving citing BTC price trend toward halving to back- up his prediction but I wonder which factor could propel BTC to this high?    

Is worthy to note that SEC approval and other factor has double exposure for this industry with the influx of newbies in the space. Will you advise them to stick to sell the news and buy the FUD strategy or do you have a better strategy that works for you when your were a newbie?",1706262335,384319,Donsaudi29,t2_rznelnyu,459c282d3fbe8eba4fd7f1015ff63938371db6857ca7ee12912b0f644080d751,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1abepr7/do_you_still_believe_in_buy_the_fud_and_sell_the/

369,USDC on Moonriver chain worth less," Hi,

I have around 300 USDC on Moonriver chain, and I wanted to send them to my Binance account. Though, Binance does not accept deposit from Moonriver chain.

One way to do that is to swap my USDC into Moonriver ([https://app.solarbeam.io/exchange/swap](https://app.solarbeam.io/exchange/swap)), and then send my Moonriver on Moonriver chain to Binance, and from there converting again in USDC.

BUT, when I try to convert my USDC to Moonriver, I would get only around 2 Moonriver:

This because the exchange rate is set to 1 MOVR = 150.1 USDC, but 1 MOVR on Binance is roughly 21€.

The page showed me their bank details (UAB Bifinity) so I paid via bank transfer which should take a few days. They should receive my money on monday or tuesday. So after sending them the money, I closed the tab. But now there's a problem: I can't find my order in the fiat center trade history. I bought 230 Euro worth of USDT so I send them 230 euro. Then I noticed ""fee: 1 Euro"" under ""spend: 230 Euro"" so I made another bank transfer of 1 Euro with the same details and reference to cover this fee, but this can't possibly the error!? Also I'm wondering: Will sending the fee and the ""spend"" money separately cause any issues?

432,BTC is worthless fr fr,"

the title is hyperbolic to get interest for the discussion. so lets    skip the ""BTC is actually worth whatever someone will pay for it""    arguments, which obviously are true. If someone will give you 50k for a    BTC then technically that BTC you sell is worth 50k.   

original post didnt like some of my links so just to make the post   go i removed all source links and will post them in order of appearance   in a comment below.   

**BTC produces no revenues** 

&#x200B;

* When you buy a stock you buy into revenue, future revenues, and the    revenue growth. BTC does not produce any revenues. In this way it is    more like gold or a commodity.     
 
* We could compare it to a currency but....     
 

**BTC is a bad currency** 

&#x200B;

* ***Slow transaction times***   
 
   * Bitcoin processes 7 transactions per second. Visa, on the other hand, is able to process approximately 24,000 TPS     
 
   * before anyone says ""well achktually most banks and CCs take 48 hrs    to clear"" yeah because they actually have to provide consumer    protections and anti money laundering services. Thats not a win for you    that you dont do any of that shit and...     
 
   * it still takes up to an hour and a half  for some BTC to transfer.     
 
* ***High fees***   
 
   * December 2023 article BTW, fees are spiking right now.     
 
* ***Full of fraud***   
 
* ***No consumer protections***   
 
   * its decentralized nature means that there are no protections against    scams or losses that you might have from human errors that you might    see at actual institutions in the financial sector. Credit cards are    great at shielding against fraud, and bank accounts hold FDIC insurance    up to certain limits. There are none of these protections on BTC.     
 
      * **Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and can only be refunded by the receiving party.**   
 
* ***Nobody uses it as a currency***   
 
   * when is the last time you bought a pizza with BTC. you dont, you hoard it like a store of value.     
 
   * We could compare it to gold gold except....     
 

**BTC is actually worthless.** 

&#x200B;

* All the actual development in the space is done on Ethereum and other cryptos, not BTC.     
 
   * BTC not even in top 25 for dapps.     
 
   * As the first mover it actually works as a negative to the BTC as it    could not predict the problems that would come up and as a   decentralized  thing it is difficult to change.     
 
* It's a bad store of value     
 
   * It is volatile. so storing your cash in it is extraordinarily risky.     
 
      * BTC crashes ALOT.     
 
      * if you really look at the price history of BTC it explodes in    2020-2021 with corona virus money. its dumb money flowing in. it crashes    with the S&P then follows it except it has crashes the S&P    doesn't while having all the same crashes the S&P does. Again had    you bought peak S&P like December 2022 vs peak BTC even same month    December 2022 you have made money on the S&P purchase but lost it    significantly, like 30% , on the BTC.     
 
   * unlike gold that at the bare minimum must retain some value for its    usefulness in electronics and jewellery, BTC is inherently not good  for   anything. It is a solution searching for a problem and can't even   handle  the problems other cryptos were designed to handle specifically   because  BTC sucks.     
 
   * gold comparisons are rather uninspiring as you only need go back to    the 1990s to see the stagnant and volatile performance of gold over  the   years. gold also way under performs the s&p historically.     
 

**It moves with the markets and therefore does not hedge you against anything** 

&#x200B;

* overlay the s&p and BTC and see for yourself.     
 
   * BTC crashes even before the S&P in late 2021, like we would    expect of a risky asset class. the high risk goes first and is last to    be taken back on.     
 
   * then only rises again lagging the S&P. In fact the S&P has    made new ATH. BTC has not, its still like 20k, which is about 40-50% of    its current price, to ATH again.     
 
   * it crashes all 2022     
 
      * INFLATION TIME BTW, WHERE IS THIS HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION?     
 
   * then only rises again lagging the S&P.     
 
* In fact the S&P has made new ATH. BTC has not, its still like    20k, which is about 40-50% of its current price, to ATH again.     
 
   * chart here but look on your own charting too cause this is only to 2022 -     
 
   * not just me saying this - see comment for links     
 

**Rarity alone does not make a thing valuable.** 

**my long term thesis is that BTC is mostly worthless** 

&#x200B;

* it is a speculative asset class     
 
   * moves with the market,     
 
   * does not function well as a currency for transactions     
 
   * is trying to solve a problem nobody has as visa and mastercard exist     
 
   * has no consumer protections     
 
   * has no applications being developed on it in the space     
 
   * like buying TSLA except TSLA actually produces cars and generates a revenue off their sale     
 
* other cryptos, maybe Ethereum, have a longer shelf life as they    MAYBE will develop some kind of novel application, but they also will    see huge downsides as this fades away.     
 
* thats not to say you cant make money in the meantime trading BTC     
 
   * **it is a game of greater fool** where you are just hoping some other idiot will pay twice today what you paid for something that is essentially worthless.

437,Do you think Copy Trading is safe haven for Newbies?,"The Crypto industry is still a very young industry as such will continue to face many obstacles but lately the industry has start gaining rapid exposure and more investors are interested in the industry. Navigating this volatile market can be daunting and this has taught many a hard lesson but with opportunities abound in the space, some are still eager to find a smooth landing. Is mostly advisable to seek adequate knowledge of the industry before throwing in dollars but most newbies are eager to make their first profit or expect overnight wealth as such won’t be able to focus on seeking knowledge.

  
Recently, in an AMA session on Twitter an analyst introduced copy trading to newbies stating that it gives them a smooth landing in the space and their could easily learn from the expert traders. He further said that copy trading is time-efficient and best for busy traders/newbies. He explained that it gives them the experience needed to develop a good risk management plan, learn trading from pros, diversify portfolios and master market volatility.

  
Well, I yielded to his advice and decided to try copy trading, though I made some profits and few loses. One major problem i found about this strategy is the probability of copying the right trader. What are those features you look for before copying an expert? Anyway, i still prefer studying the chart and improving my FA and TA so i can improve my trading skills and create the right strategy that will work for me but i am an inquisitive trader and will like to know if you will recommend copy trading to newbies?

523,How to sell on Binance and retain value?," 

Hi everyone

My sister from overseas sent me some crypto instead of cash.

I do not trade, so I had to create an account with Binance to receive it.

Now, the value of my wallet says around $1000, but when I try to sell it to USD, it says I am to receive around $950. I understand there are fees, but that seem steep. Am I missing something?

And what would be the best way to retain as much value and withdraw into my bank account?

652,Shower Thoughts on Monero's Future,"   **Black Markets Matter**

Those who know the history of cryptocurrency are familiar with BTC's   meteoric rise in price and popularity. Somebody invented Silk Road in   2011, kids around the world started buying and selling their drugs for   Bitcoin, and by 2013 the price of BTC had increased 100x or more.  Today,  XMR has replaced BTC on online black markets due to its privacy   features and low fees.  XMR price has dumped 25% in the past week due  to Binance's delisting.   

More than 10 years later, we survey the crypto landscape and see all   sorts of hype about Store of Value, Digital Gold, BTC ETFs, Smart   Contracts, DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2, Blockchain Applications, etc. Crypto is a   multi-billion dollar industry and Wall Street is all over it. Crypto  is  known mostly as a speculative investment rather than a  permissionless  and non-state-controlled currency system.   

What if, hypothetically, all of these ""innovations"" in the crypto   space are bullshit? What if the only truly sustainable growth from   cryptocurrency arises from open and free black markets? What if XMR   users continue to circumvent whatever roadblocks governments put in   their way? What if governments' obsessive push to KYC and de-anonymize   crypto users simply *increases the demand* for privacy coins like   XMR? What if fiat hyperinflation continues unchecked in a desperate   attempt to put the crypto genie back in the bottle? What if people wake   up to the hell of CBDCs faster than expected?   

Boys, we might be sitting on a boatload of Kryptonite.   ",1708420785,384808,wtfCraigwtf,t2_3m05y5e9,a9a9b54ac317e92d5b862a7bd29bee7e32cabe5950bce599ab486ef1479f52fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1avdip9/shower_thoughts_on_moneros_future/

730,Navigating the Sea of Nano/Micro Cap AI Cryptos: Seeking criteria to filter out," 

Hi everyone,

As someone primarily invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm exploring the idea of diversifying my portfolio by dedicating around 10% of my investments into nano or micro cap coins, specifically within the AI categories. CoinMarketCap lists about 100 tokens that fit this bill, but I'm at a bit of a crossroads on how to effectively sift through them to identify those with genuine potential.

Given the vast number of factors to consider, from price history (if reached ath in previous bull markets likely means it'll never reach a new ath) to trading volume, whether they're listed on major exchanges, and the credibility and track record of the founders, the process seems daunting.

I'm looking for guidance on how to navigate these waters. How do you filter through such a vast array of projects? What criteria do you prioritize to narrow down your choices before delving deeper into technical analysis or whitepaper evaluations?

Any insights, strategies, or personal experiences you could share would be immensely helpful. I believe that among these nano or micro caps lies the next big wave in the crypto space, and I want to ensure I'm making informed decisions.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1708890054,385011,ezio313,t2_6801ehfn,f1e127822a60c66f97d20fa836a10f3da6742451d4667266ae6096ce9a407eb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1azwsuj/navigating_the_sea_of_nanomicro_cap_ai_cryptos/

734,Who pays out the gains on a 50-100x futures contracts?,"For some context, during these last two years when celsius,ftx, voyager etc went under, some traders used it as an opportunity to make tons of money by shorting ftt or cel on platforms like mexi using anywhere from 10-100x leverage.

So my question is where does the money come from to pay out these perp contracts for a coin like cel token where the underlying liquidity and market cap of the spot price is near zero?

Ie. a crypto twitter trader i follow opened a 25x short on cel token at the start of the bankruptcy case when it was like around $1. As of today it's at 19 cents. 

If you do the math, even with a $1000 investment that's thousands of dollars mexi or whatever futures platform has to pay out. Where does that money come from?

Trying to wrap my head around how the perp market works. The funding fee and all that is straightforward but as to who pays out the winners i still haven't been able to understand yet.

Judging by the title of the post you may have already got the idea of what the question is. The thing is that I am quite green in this industry, though I've been very interested in cryptos last years. 

I have been saving up for my further education abroad, and I'm kinda worried about my savings which are stored on my debit card since this doesn't seem to be the safest place to save my money, because it ""belongs"" to the bank as long as it's stored on the debit card. I don't trust banks. In addition, I could've saved up at home, but this idea is too dull and doesn't seem to be safe as well, anybody can come over and just take it. That's how I have gradually come to saving up in a cold wallet.

I’m trying to place an order online, and one of the only option I can currently use for checkout is Tether. I’ve never even started learning much about cryptocurrency, so I have a couple of questions:

1. Can someone explain to me, in fairly simplified terms, how to use Tether properly to avoid losing my funds altogether? Maybe even specific apps too?

2. The two Tether options are through Tron and through Ethereum. What’s the difference, and how would I know which network I’m going through when making transactions?

807,Seeking Expert Insights: Evaluating Altcoins with low Market Cap – Key Criteria & Recommendations,"&#x200B;

Hello!

I've been holding solely BTC and ETH, but now that alt season is on the corner I'm diving into the world of altcoins and am exploring investment opportunities in tokens with market caps ranging from $10M to $500M. My theory is that crypto is all about hype and narratives, last time it was nfts and metaverse, this cycle I think it will be AI.

I've put together a list of criteria to help evaluate these tokens effectively, but I'd love to get your insights, experiences, and any additional factors you think are crucial. Here are my current considerations:

1. **Market Cap**: Ensures the coin fits within my targeted investment range. (This is pretty obvious)
2. **Daily Trading Volume**: A measure of liquidity and investor interest. **What do you think is a healthy ratio of trading volume to market cap?**
3. **Social Interaction**: Engagement metrics from platforms like LunarCrush. **How crucial do you find social media engagement for a token's success?**
4. **Distribution of Holders**: Looking at the concentration of ownership. **How do you view contracts and exchange addresses holding a significant percentage of the tokens, what does this signifies?**
5. **Circulating Supply / Total Supply**: To understand potential for price appreciation. **Should release patterns and the impact on TVL also be a consideration, I'm still confused about this one lol**
6. **Technology/Use Case**: Given the skepticism and low real-world adoption in crypto, **how important do you think a solid use case is for a project's success, my conviction is that it is the least important criteria?**
7. **Team Transparency**: Evaluating the team's track record and openness. **How do you verify the authenticity and reliability of a team's background, like they could easily lie on their past experiences on linkedin?**
8. **GitHub Activity**: Checking for ongoing development. **Is inactivity for over a year a definitive red flag?**
9. **Historical Performance**: **Do you think a record of hitting previous ATHs is a good indicator of potential future performance or the opposite?**
10. **The Age of the Coin**: **How do you weigh the potential of newer tokens (<2 years old) against those with a longer history, like statistically speaking** does old coins who hit ath in previous cycle have more or less potential compared to recent ones(<2 years old)",1709311614,385211,ezio313,t2_6801ehfn,85e9047306183b9b76db12554a9202eae70f4f199c9773b6bb8ab362bb390682,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1b3yxzf/seeking_expert_insights_evaluating_altcoins_with/

The goal for IJAS is to have 1 million business beacons and 100,000,000 app downloads to create a combination of proximity marketing and incentivized ad consumption. They then have partner networks where you can trade the tokens for different valuable items. The IJAS token is listed on multiple exchanges as well. The more the app is downloaded, the more benefit to small businesses, the more the tokens are used the more valuable they become on the exchanges.

This was my account address for shiba: [0x1F178F267449261F6F3454E89B02D0829a50A616](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f178f267449261f6f3454e89b02d0829a50a616)

and this is the account it went into, it says on the etherscan this address, but I think the wallet was the second one also on the etherscan:

[0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce) (Shiba Inu: SHIB Token)

0x801F4f10e85E09e91e956AC9A1107c6d32bD1475

Can someone please tell me if the address that got them has transferred it onto binance?

I saw people complaining about recent spam attacks and downgrading Nano from there, but even during the stress test, Nano transactions were still working under 2 minutes (which is indeed much slower than the usual couple seconds, but significantly lower than most other cryptocurrencies!!). And every week the Devs do a twitter space where they talk about the work being done.

954,Ever heard of a “retrodrop” scam? ,"Hi, 

I’m looking for some advice. 

I found a guy posting about a current “retrodrop” for a relatively well known crypto. The retrodrop is done on an exchange. 

Ignoring the fees, if you withdraw the crypto to a specific address, the exchange will return your withdrawn crypto + 0.5%. 

I decided to try it out and it worked, I bought 25.111 of the crypto, I withdrew, 10 mins later I received 25.2366 of the crypto. 

I tried researching on the cryptos website and Twitter but can find no mention of this or any other retrodrops at all. 

I can’t help feeling something is dodgy. Am I being scammed some how?",1709973849,385739,Rushotal,t2_zg9e3,7fbf13135bf8fd0d27a505d8fa5687331da0e51720fd6ee9243ae252cebf7560,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1bad96f/ever_heard_of_a_retrodrop_scam/

959,$Cypher: Safeguarding Digital Secrets with Stealth Encryption,"In an era prioritizing digital privacy, a new utility project emerges as a beacon of security: CYPHER. This innovative tool empowers users to encrypt their personal information within image, audio, or video files, offering heightened protection for sensitive data.

Unveiling Cypher: The Digital Fort Knox

Imagine a cloak of invisibility for private information—a shield against prying eyes, hackers, and data breaches. With Cypher, users can seamlessly embed confidential data within everyday media files, rendering them impervious to unauthorized access.

How Cypher Works

Cypher operates on a simple yet robust principle: hiding in plain sight. Here’s how it works:

Encryption: Users upload their desired media file to Cypher’s platform, along with the information they wish to encrypt. The cloak of invisibility is then woven, concealing the data within the media file.

Security Layers: Cypher employs state-of-the-art encryption algorithms to ensure information remains impenetrable. Each file becomes a digital vault, with multiple layers of protection guarding its contents.

Decryption: When users need to retrieve encrypted data, they can effortlessly decode the file on the Cypher website or app. The hidden information emerges unscathed, ready to be accessed with the user’s unique decryption key.

Applications of Cypher: Protecting Valuables

Secure Storage of Seed Phrases and Private Keys: Cypher provides a secure solution for storing seed phrases and private keys. By embedding this crucial information within innocuous media files, users can safeguard their digital assets with unparalleled protection.

Private Messaging: Say goodbye to eavesdroppers and prying eyes with Cypher’s encrypted messaging feature. Users can encode messages within media files, ensuring only the intended recipient can decipher the content.

Confidential Information: From sensitive contacts to personal identification information, Cypher offers a discreet way to safeguard confidential text. By embedding text within media files, users can rest assured their information is shielded from unauthorized access.

The Future of Digital Privacy: Cypher’s Promise

As data breaches continue to make headlines and privacy concerns grow, Cypher stands as a beacon of hope for individuals seeking to protect their digital footprint. With its seamless encryption process and versatile applications, Cypher heralds a new era of privacy-conscious technology.

Hi Reddit,

Looking to set up a legacy gift for my 1-month-old niece, including some crypto for the long haul (10-15 years). Bitcoin's a safe bet, but I'm curious about high-potential coins.

My current picks are Kaspa and Polkadot. Would love to hear your thoughts on:

Coin survivability: Which coin has a stronger chance of thriving in the next decade?

Growth potential: Which coin offers the most significant upside over the long term?

Open to all opinions and insights!

A week ago we started accepting Sol on our ecommerce website Clutch Clothing and it has been going quite well ( probably because we are in a bull market )

Noticing the trend of crypto to gift cards ( solcard, pawpay etc ) today we have added gift cards to the store. No middleman token like SOLC, we accept just straight Sol payments and the visa gift card accepted world wide is sent digitally.

www.clutchclothing.com.au/product/ACTIV.%20Visa%20Gift%20Card?id=116

Simply on checkout, instead of checking out with Square ( normal checkout button ) Connect and click checkout with Solana.

Added benefits:

We will be releasing our CLUTCH token in a few weeks, you will not need this token to purchase items on the store however it will grant you discounts to items and give many other benefits.

All wallets that make a purchase on the CLUTCH store between then and now will be eligible for our token 

A percentage of profits made from sol purchases will be used for the liquidity pool.

1147,Rfox changing to Juice - Is this a scam and did it involve insider trading?,"Rfox changing is changing to Juice, a token I have not heard of previously. Is it common for a Crypto project to just switch and change their tokens?

Recently Rfox announced they are changing their coin to a new coin juice. The market cap dropped by 30 percent, and I was curious to think if someone inside Rfox suddenly sold 3-4 million dollars before the announcement and took this money. Not sure if someone has a way to find this out? Also I was wondering what the max market cap of Rfox reached (it may have been around 200 million I think) and if people from within Rfox then sold their coins and used all of investors money to fund their project and their life? It’s a lot of money and they could easily just invest this money else where like property and live comfortable from the rent. Is this inside trading and is this something that happens and is unregulated in crypto spaces? A final thought was I remember looking at some charts and seeing their peaks perfectly flat a few days before the announcement. My thoughts were is someone using AI trading with a stack of Rfox coins possibly from within Rfox? Anyway if someone has some thoughts on this I would love to know, thanks",1710959732,386323,LHTNING33,t2_ji1va4mk,d58832cce19ea5ffdebf0e4275f9a98f7f7604a0f16f4f34375d7167697bb2cb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bjkqk5

1152,"What is the real cost of using Binance Convert to swap crypto? Binance say this Convert tool has no fees, but obviously Binance make their money by giving you a slightly worse price","The **Binance Convert** tool allows you to quickly convert one cryptocurrency to another.

Binance state that there are no fees for using this tool, but say that ""*every trade you make on Convert requires only a small spread in the corresponding Liquidity Pool*"". So Binance make their money via this spread, which no doubt results in you getting a slightly worse price for the crypto you buy.

But does anyone have any idea as a percentage how much money you lose from this slightly worse price?

The normal fee Binance charges when you trade one cryptocurrency for another are 0.1% (or 0.075% if you pay your fees with BNB). How does the hidden cost of Binance Convert compare to this 0.1% fee?

I would like to know if I might be better off using **Binance Trade** to exchange one crypto for another, instead of **Binance Convert**.

1259,Will the next Bitcoin Halving maintain the usual price trend after halving?,"So much anticipation toward the fourth Bitcoin halving event expected to take place next month. Halving is a deflationary mechanism aimed at controlling BTC supply by slashing miners BTC reward by 50%.  Halving usually affect Bitcoin price prior and after the event, in turn it yield a ripple effect on the whole industry. Some analysts agreed that halving determines cryptocurrency season, bull or bear as such the anxiety in the space. A lots of new millionaires will be made while other will remain side watcher because they can’t spot the opportunities in the market.   
   
During the first BTC halving in 2012 where miners reward was reduced from 50 to 25, BTC price was around $13 but it rose to over $1,152 few months after the halving presenting the first price impact after halving. The second halving witness similar trend, in 2016 when reward was reduced from 25 to 12.5, the price was around $664 and it reached a peak of $17,760 few months after halving. The third halving maintained similar trend in 2020 when block reward was slashed from 12.5 to 6.25, the price was around $8,500 and after halving its set an ATH of above $69k few months after halving.   
   
So this price trend has garnered so much prediction and speculation in the market where some believe BTC will hit above $85k before halving and over $180k after halving. With BTC already retesting its previous ATH, many enthusiasts are eager to witness the next BTC ATH but only the wise ones understand that they need to position well to benefit from this speculation.    
Right now there is so much awareness in the industry compared to what was obtainable in the past. Key world financial players are now involved which has bring more exposure and increase uncertainty in the industry.   
   
Some expert have noted that BTC usually maintain a similar circle as such users need to understand the trend and history to stay afloat. I have also noticed some top exchanges rolling out events to celebrate/welcome the halving. One that caught my attention is the learn to earn on Bitget where users are encourage to showcase their understanding of the halving to benefit some $BGB rewards. Such event will increase users understanding of the Bitcoin halving and further increase their interest in the industry. It will also help them to prepare adequately for it.

1302,Crypto Advice for Offshore Betting Account(s) - Complete Noob to Crypto,"Hopefully this is the right place...

&#x200B;

I'm a semi-pro (part time) sports bettor in the US but not in a legal state.  Currently rely on being able to get down when traveling for work, and DFS sites that are available in my state.  But I have decided to go with an offshore betting account or two as I know I can win long term on them..  Lots of these offshore sites suggest crypto as the best option for deposits/withdraws.  And I've also heard it's safer than using your card, particularly with offshore sites.  

&#x200B;

Problem is that I know basically nothing about crypto.  This particular book does have a tutorial that suggests using Coinbase and Bitcoin.  So as far as I can tell Coinbase is where they hold your cryptocurrency (is that the same as a ""wallet""?).  So I guess I sign up for an account and purchase X amount of cryptocurrency?  And then simply use that to deposit and withdraw?  If that's the case, how do I withdraw actual money back from Coinbase?  And should Bitcoin the the crypto of choice or does that even matter?

&#x200B;

Any other advice also greatly appreciated.  Thank you!  ",1711759344,386747,AlpineWhiteF10,t2_kicqh,cf2da8e7b511afce945aafaf6d1098a49b8081881c4aceb6b1e0cdabd25b53f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1br4kei/crypto_advice_for_offshore_betting_accounts/

As I was digging through the white paper, I went hmm, lightening network is a solution to the block size and speed problem, but then there's other scaling issues there, as well as price, then I looked at the mining pools, and went hmm, it's CENTRALIZED across 3 pools, then I looked at coin.dance, and saw a comparison of other important metrics, and saw bch had the top 2/3 pools being for solo miners, which looks more decentralized, and the fees are really low, then I saw bitcoinabc which is known as ecash, another fork of bch but by the original creators (interestingly taking the best part of bitcoin, PoW, and putting Avalanche PoS on top of it now for smart contracts. And bsv, well lol, we all know CSW is a fraud as proven by court, and his goal was to steal the million satoshi coins via OP_COURT, and bsv is ran only on data center computers, so we can just disregard that one. So the only thing preventing these other coins from succeeding is the adoption and has power.

So who's to say people dont wake up when government/corporate control further destroys what we know as bitcoin and one of these other coins becomes the real banking rebellion?

1450,Accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD token to my Poloniex account via Tron network,"Hi, as the title states, I accidentally transferred ETH instead of ETHOLD to my Poloniex account. ETH is the newer token that's supposed to replace ETHOLD. Both are TRON tokens, however Poloniex no longer supports deposit/withdraw of ETH via the TRON network. I used the same TRON address for this erroneous transfer as I have done previously with my ETHOLD transfers to Poloniex.

I already reached out to Poloniex and am waiting for a response. I know I can't expect much in these types of situations, but does anyone have experience getting their tokens back in situations like this?

TIA.

(I've transferred tokens so many times before without issues but mistook ETH for ETHOLD, unfortunately.)",1712512571,387211,pantaloonsss,t2_179w2x,f827534bc39f9ae72a65c98e55493dddef108012c0325d4e08be1fef0018a828,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1byan5s/accidentally_transferred_eth_instead_of_ethold/

So, if you remember, Bakkt were on track to become a major player in the market with an enterprise value of around $2.1B after merging back in 2021. However, they were accused that their merger documents were full of inaccuracies and omitted crucial information, violating regulations.

And that they also gave false info about their financial controls and made errors in their financial statements, and the investors suit them for it.

And after all these years and all the disputes, Bakkt recently agreed to pay a $3M settlement to resolve this case. So, if you have traded BKKT back then you [file for the payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/bakkt-investor-settlement) or through the settlement administrator.",1712621873,387263,thesatisfiedplethora,t2_oj07q685,76cb97054e1ee1adb1c206befcdaf613c498c33ec85e1ef816fd09df1eaa6d96,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1bze61n/deadline_update_for_bakkt_paying_3m_settlement/

1473,Could $ETH hit 100k in the next Bull-run?,"Reminiscing on Arthur Hayes's tweets on his visit to his ancestors in quest to know when the bull-run will start. His prediction after his acclaimed encounter really baffles me. Thanks for Coingecko recent video on “How high can Ethereum go in 2024.” The bull-run is inevitable and such predictions and speculations are bound to fly around. Some might come to pass while others will remain a mirage. Standard Chartered has hinted at possible ETH spot ETF approval on 23rd May and expects ETH to hit 4000 by then. JP Morgan was also in the prediction picture and relied on the upcoming Cancun upgrade as a catalyst for ETH performance that will propel the price to over 8000 by 2026, is that not far? Arthur Hayes has a different view to all this prediction and sees eth at 100k. Though, I believe we will eventually get there but definitely not in this bull-run.

I have been trying to make a BTC transaction through Binance, on their FAQ it says they support BTC Lightning which is why I bought my BTC there.
Now that I am trying to withdraw, I am left with only one option and that is to pay 50 USD fee.

Their support is awful - first confirmed they have BTC Lightning, but then claiming it doesn't work at the moment and don't know when it will.

1677,A warning on illiquidity risks in some popular memes.,"Before you invest in a token make sure you understand the risks involved, in particular Brett is pushed by countless influencers, but a few seconds of research will show you that it is impossible for any of these people to cash out without using you as exit liquidity. For example, crashius clays public position is worth more than the value of the ether in the liquidity pool. Ask yourself why he claims it will go as high as it will. And that's not even considering the fact that the project was stolen from BMoney, so you will be supporting scammers by buying it.

I am not saying it is impossible to make money with it, and I am happy for you if you have, but don't roundtrip your bags, because the second the countless shills want to cash out, the coin will crash in an epic fashion. Don't be their exit liqudity. Youtubers telling you to buy their bags are all midcurves with no edge in the market.

If you want to support BMoney after his idea was stolen from him, he has a new project called Warpie which has a new swaps front end just released, and is creating an animated series. 

Otherwise there are many other memecoins with a high quality liquidity profile such as Based Chad (with the yes chad logo, there's a blue faced Chad coin run by scammers), mfercoin, coinye westcoin, doginme, toshi, tybg... among others.

The one thing all of these ""higher quality"" coins have in common is adjacency to farcaster communities and the aerodrome protocol, so you earn passive income for staking these funded by the aerodrome pool fees.

Unlike traditional blockchains that struggle with speed and security, Quilibrium uses a new structure called a hypergraph and advanced cryptographic techniques. This means it can handle more transactions securely and efficiently.

Quilibrium is in its early stages, but it shows great promise. Whitepaper can be found on their webpage.

2214,My Trust Wallet was scammed. ,"In may 22 in a telegram chat I found a crypto exchanger operating in Kyrgyzstan.  after discussing the conditions, I was sent a message with a link to a site to check cryptocurrencies for Risk. (AML service amlreview.com) an exchanger employee explained that it is necessary to check the cryptocurrency for sanctions and purity. I followed the link and then selected the suggested wallet service I use. This is Trust Vallet).  Next, amlreview requested access to view wallet transactions.  About 5 minutes later I discovered that the funds from my wallet had disappeared in a direction unknown to me. WITHOUT MY ACCESS!!! I did not confirm the operation to send funds to the account. I ask you to return all written funds for payment hash number 0x0879929803fc73997584f3647cfaf6ae6e0d5e93aebb7b5da113089d1076a27c.  I also request that you flag the recipient of the funds as a scammer and discourage them from doing so.  I am ready to pay for 1. telegram chat correspondence. 2. Resolving any issues and the need to find a lawbreaker.

2237,5K bonus? Coinbase? Am I over reacting ?,"Three weird things happen to me on Coinbase wallet.Today I cashed out of a phony crypto app, all of a sudden at the same time I get another  transaction that I don’t remember buying but didn’t realized until I got home.  a few hours later, I finally i get home and(felt good to be home) hop on my Mac and sign try signing on to my wallet. I couldn’t sign on(I guess Im getting old) so I decided to change my password on the chrome extension.  I changed the password, everything is all good. Then a few hours later I sign on to the coin base wallet on my phone and see that other transaction. And I think I have an alert to changelog out or something like that. I also realized my money starts with “a$”. Which it never was like this. Was it because my Vpn was set to Australia?(maybe)  I turned off my VON and it still says it the A$. Also when I changed my password and signed back on, my 2nd backup wallet wasn’t there. What’s going on!? 
And I almost forgot to mention, the transaction says 5000$ bonus on it. ",1717482366,388413,THECREATURR,t2_snaarjgaz,ad1aaf70d1e27cc97faadbe68a08a9b78a5deb46f6f84bb0bb6ef9e1a9e64141,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d7qhg2

2318,Blockchain: A Path to Trust and Unity,"Blockchain technology, at its core, represents a fascinating shift in how we approach trust. It operates on the assumption of potential abuse, setting up incentives so that the only profitable way to interact with the system is through genuine contribution. Every malicious attack is met with economic penalties, creating a beautifully robust system. This is a vital advancement, one that we undeniably need in today’s world.

However, it's crucial to recognize that this system, while ingenious, is ultimately a crutch. It serves as a temporary solution to a deeper issue: our current inability to trust one another by default. Instead of assuming goodwill, we set up barriers and safeguards to protect ourselves from potential harm. This is necessary given our present circumstances, but it's not the end goal.

Reflect for a moment on the past. Watch some old movies and observe how people dealt with trust and uncertainty. Before the era of instant information, before we could verify everything with a quick Google search, trust was a fundamental part of daily interactions. This trust made these interactions more meaningful, fostering a sense of connection and community that seems increasingly rare today.

My point is this: while we navigate the complexities of our modern world with tools like blockchain, we must also strive to grow together spiritually. We need to work towards a future where trust is the default, where we can unite as a single species, transcending the divisions that lead to conflict. Imagine a world where we see each other not as “others,” but as members of one giant human family.

Let’s leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to build a foundation of trust and then take it a step further. Let’s aim for a world where technology is not a crutch, but a bridge to a more connected, trusting, and unified human experience. Together, we can transform not just how we interact economically, but how we relate to each other as human beings.",1718094818,388536,Atyzzze,t2_zld9t26uj,77b817769ec84871f40def74912b67f25a04b07613b67be4adc6bcd00d2dae40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1dd97vf/blockchain_a_path_to_trust_and_unity/

2368,What ecosystem will lead to crypto mass adoption?,"A lot has been happening since the turn of the year, which has attracted more people into crypto with the highlights as follows:

1. Tap-to-earn games on telegram heralded by the success of Notcoin.

2. ZK proof protocols with improved technology on Ethereum network highlighting low network fees and scalability.

3. Liquid staking on Ethereum L2 protocols.

4. Bitcoin staking.

5. Inscriptions on network layers.

6. DEPIN projects with emphasis on seamless onboarding process.

7. Integration of web2 and web3 heralded by Ethermail

Although, we're not quite there yet, but there are signs, this year is gonna play a major role in massive crypto adoption with the added incentive of an early bull run in Q1 of 2024.

Pre-market trading also gives wannabes an idea of the potential of these projects and further fuel their enthusiasm to wanna contribute to the ecosystem and become crypto natives.

2393,Crypto Copy Trading: Advantages and Disadvantages,"Currently a lot of newbies are interested in copy trading. This is very evident by the number of questions not only on reddit, but also on other sites. That is why I decided to clarify all the pros and cons of this way of earning money in the crypto market.

If you have any thoughts, please share them in the comments. Maybe I will add some to the post

**First of all, let me start with the pros:**

* **Ability to repeat after a professional**. I think this is the most significant advantage of copy trading. What could be better than watching an expert in his field do his job. I have seen many communities where followers asked for such an option.
* **Low effort minimal start in the crypto market.** Copy trading platforms or exchanges are designed to be user-friendly, making it convenient for individuals to start trading with minimal effort and funds.
* **Diversification of risks.** No one ever forbids trading your own and copy trading. Some exchanges allow creating sub-accounts, one for hodling, copy trading and trading. 

**There are no pros without some cons of copy trading:**

* **Risk of losses due to poor decisions or even malicious purposes**. Sadly, but true that copy trading does not always guarantee profits. Followers are exposed to the same market risks as the traders they copy. There is a one-way trust relationship, where you allow someone to manage your assets.
* **Overreliance.** Even if you see and copy the trades, you may not see the analysis and the motivations behind them. This can also hinder the development of personal investment skills and decision making.
* **Dependence on platform/exchange reliability**. The effectiveness of copy trading relies heavily on the reliability and performance of the platform. Technical issues or downtime could potentially disrupt trading activity and affect results.

Copy trading can indeed be an attractive option for those who wish to enter the financial markets with less effort and time. However, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons for yourself and see if it fits your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Their stable coin storage is not that far off; AVAX is also cheaper to transact on.

But low fees/income is a problem in of its self and AVAX should probably raise fees because there's not a lot of incentive to run a node especially when it costs so much AVAX to run.

Orina emerges to address these challenges by harnessing blockchain technology and cutting-edge solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics. At Orina, we believe that technological innovation can drive sustainable development and enhance productivity in the agricultural sector.

While some analysts attributed this dip to MT Gox disbursement plan and Germany selling BTC news, it is important to note that fear was the major factor. A tweet from one of the MT Gox creditors clarified “So far they’ve distributed none” but why such a dip? The exchange isn’t selling off BTC but distributing the token to their creditor. Some might decide to sell while others might hold. It's good to see some major retracement today which further proves my point that fear was the major factor.

2908,Crypto currency fraud mega corp,"I have uncovered a mega corporation whose sole business aim is to defraud people out of their hard earned cash. Including me. 

The shell company, the highest level I am able to get without any granted powers, is luck7.inc. This is a company based in South East Asia, operating in at least Shanghai, Ho Chi Min City & Manila. 

This company, is the registrar organisation and currently the highest owner (I am able to find) of multiple scam websites, all with the same appearance. Websites such as Oexbake.top/oexbake.com/oexgeek.xyz/ordioex.com/oexgeek.online/ordioex.top/ordioex.xyz

These are just a few that I have found. There are more, some operated so long they expired. 

This company, primarily operates, but not exclusively, Romance Pig Butchering Scams. They are using paid actresses who will act like they are in a relationship with the victim. These actress are used in photos, videos, voice notes, phone calls & video calls. The actress will even try and convince you use the website, or invest more whilst on these calls, so they know fully well what is going on, even if they are not fully involved. My scammer was “western” not just the usual usage of “Asian” women. My scammer was called Emily Campbell, she pretended to be from Australia and living in Perth, Scotland. She actually lives in Southampton, because she took a video of her apartment, that I asked for when after I realised was being scammed, but before she knew I had realised. The address was ascertained from a screenshot. While I know she wasn’t the one person I was most probably talking to, the phone calls and video calls with references to our messages and the investing, meant she is involved enough to know the morale repercussions of what she is choosing to do. 

When I first asked about oexbake.top, weeks ago now on another website, so showed me the post. Extremely upset - she did not know it was mine, and I pretended it wasn’t. This confirmed the scam, as they have operators lurking in r / cryptoscams. 

I have reported everything, to all appropriate authorities, who have called it an international cyber risk. 

I hope this post, will stay live, and allow multiple people avoid these scams in the future. Regardless of what the organisation decide or try to do. Please share and interact this post to get it near the front page on google if any of these key words are googled.

Never used it, never looked into it, and don't know really how it works in the slightest. I suddenly find myself having to make international payment using cryptocurrency, and am really at a loss. I've looked into a couple of the bigger exchange platforms like Coinbase, but that doesn't support the TRON network. I tried Binance, which does seem to support it, but it isn't supported in my region apparently. I really don't want to have to go through a giant setup, and waiting period just to be able to make one payment and never use it again, is there any trustable way to just make a quick purchase of USDT and transfer it to a wallet in the TRON network without jumping through all the hoops?",1723908148,391082,PugScorpionCow,t2_1776tl,417acde383c01f4ac1abf5333b40e0103c5fc50e554afd97650aa09a7fc43cc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1euk8h2/noncrypto_user_looking_for_advice_for_using_usdt/

3463,Politics is 'cryptonite'. With CEXs help.,"https://www.blockonome.com/post/venezuela-blocks-binance-and-x-amid-election

The Venezuelan government, starting August 9, had imposed a (DNS) block on Binance and X (Twitter), both widely used by Venezuelans.

""In a televised speech on August 8, President Maduro announced that he had ordered the National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) to ban access to X for ten days. This decision followed a public spat between Maduro and X owner Elon Musk, during which both figures issued challenges to one another. The block on Binance is particularly significant given the platform's popularity in Venezuela, where it serves as a critical tool for citizens seeking to exchange the highly inflated Venezuelan bolívar for more stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.""

Scummy politicians souring everything they touch. (Nigeria did the exact same Binance-X combo ban).

""Binance, in response to the government's actions, assured its users that their funds remain safe despite the block.""

Funds are SAFU, of course.

3691,"Why Everyone Should Go 33% Fiat, 33% Stocks, 33% Crypto—Your Path to Personal UBI","Alright, degenerates, listen up.

What if I told you that UBI (Universal Basic Income) is already available for you, right now? No, it’s not handed to you by some government—it's in the market. But here's the catch: to unlock it, you need to **build it yourself**. Sounds unfair? Maybe. But if you get the message, there’s profit in it for you.

The play? 33% Fiat, 33% Stocks, 33% Crypto.

**Why?**  
- **33% Fiat**: Fiat’s still king for now—gives you liquidity, lets you pay rent, buy tendies, and survive the inevitable market nukes. It honors the present reality.  
- **33% Stocks**: This is your tribute to the past—corporate powerhouses and legacy systems that still hold weight (for now). We're talking about taking advantage of the traditional financial system while it's still relevant.  
- **33% Crypto**: And here’s where the real magic happens. This is the future. DAOs, DeFi, digital scarcity—this is the direction we’re heading, whether you’re ready or not. You're investing in tomorrow, in a world where traditional fiat and corp-controlled stocks eventually hit zero, replaced by decentralized systems.

So what’s the big idea? **You’re building your own UBI.** Over time, this balanced strategy (readjusted quarterly) lets you ride the waves of economic volatility while profiting from the long game. You’re essentially stacking cash for your future “pension,” but on your own terms.

Now, here's the part most people miss. **Technological progress is already a form of UBI**. Look around you: refrigerators, hot showers, Netflix, flights around the world in 24 hours—all things that royalty couldn’t even dream of 100 years ago. Yeah, life’s unfair, but we’re better off than kings back then. Progress has been distributing wealth for decades. 

But here’s where it gets real: eventually, **currency won’t matter** anymore. We’re heading toward a future of abundance where reputation and unique contributions will be the new currency. Fairness won’t be enforced by money but by a system that recognizes each of us for who we are and what we bring to the table. 

You want in? Get on the 33/33/33 plan, build your personal UBI, and ride the wave to a world where traditional wealth becomes irrelevant.

We’re not there yet, but we’re closer than you think.

TL;DR: Life's a Ponzi, but you can profit. 33% Fiat to honor the present, 33% Stocks to nod to the past, and 33% Crypto to embrace the future. You’re building your own UBI, and one day, currency won't even matter—reputation will.

3990,Person who never used ceyotp before needs your help,"Hi, as the title says i have never used any kind of cryptocurrencies before, that being said I'll just keep the history short (and try to explain as best i can my situation)

So i was selling my personal game account, some person eventually answered but said they only could pay in cryptoscurrency. I was really in a 50/50 because i didn't wantes to deal with it but i also didn't wanted to loose the opportunity to earn 200usd for an videogame account i no longer wish to use, so i accepted

Dude was cool and eventually transferred the money to me, but he didn't told me the important part... That i had to do an test payment to verify that i wasn't doing any fraud...
Also as i was searching it depends of the page whether the deposit to make the test payment would be like 10dollars or so, this frickin page asked for 100+ anything less to that? Nope, I don't even have that money available for me

So i went for the second way support said to me... But i just cannot seem to understand what this person it's explaining to me, to copy and address and then go to the other wallet??? What???

I want to make really clear english isn't my birth language, but i still speak and write it pretty good, but no matter how hard i try i just can't seem to get it

Idk if i can mention the page but it is Thurs-dex, in case someone here knows this is a possibly easy situation but i clarify once again i have never met with crypto before.. until now

So yeah, im also gonna leave the messages between me and support just in case
