16,Computer science for sport: Track and Field college team,"I am a computer engineering and telecom PhD student who loves track and field. In the future, I would work closely with athletes by helping them with the power of computer science. 

To start from somewhere I thought I could try to **join the varsity team of my college**, I asked if they needed a computer science student and they answered me: **what can you offer? What can you do for our team to make it better?**

Here is the dilemma: **I went there to ask because I didn't know how computer science can help a track team and then they asked me the same question. What do you think?** 

Track and field, if not at the top level, is not highly supported by computer science, so what can be the same basic or more advanced services computer science can offer to the team? 

Ps. People can easily say: check out how computer science works for other sports, e.g. football, like tracking players. I would like to point out that track and field is not a collaborative sport, every athlete performs for himself/herself, besides the speed calculation I don't know what else can be useful",1704117056,366620,zackbord,t2_ae5gprot,45fd600e10d1e63b9d8be514b6e1b50db585e19e3ba979b073c8d0b925c80ced,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/18vx54t/computer_science_for_sport_track_and_field/

21,Take it easy on me...My attempt at a light based computing system.,"I started off drawing a fibre optic cable with multi-light senders but I needed a receiver that could process information and I thought of using a kind of solar panel material that is nano thin which reacts to different wave lengths of light generating electricity at different energy levels.   


So that is basically the send and receive part of my computer...  


I designed a hexagonal processing unit where light enters an empty space and is reflected within the container bouncing off walls, on each wall is a receiving solar panel that generates an energy signature and with every side working together we generate a repetitive pattern that is the basis of a computer idling. The multifaced hexagon is required for multiple numeral coded language.  


The memory is a work in progress, an SD card boots the computer and begins the light rotation and then the light rotation maintains function without the SD card backing up its current position on the SD card to resume previous rotation function when you restart the computer.  


I don't know I was bored this morning and my brain wanted to design something.  


What do you think? :D

As it stands, I understand the importance of Linear Algebra and Calculus, and so I am taking extra university courses regarding those topics, but should I also consider partial and ordinary differential equations?

Further, I am taking Number Theory 1, but which topics in number theory are especially important? I ask so I can crosscheck any topics that may be included in Number Theory 2, and if I should consider taking that as well. 

How important is combinatorics in cybersecurity? Stuff like boolean algebra and counting. 

Lastly, I understand the importance of probability theory and so I am taking courses relating to that, but what exactly in stats is important? Linear regression? Statistical inference? I could not find anything on Google. 

I also plan on pursuing courses relating to SWE and ML, but only the CS courses for ML (theres only 3). I already took discrete mathematics.

The reception here has been less than nice. I believe that I have earned right to have a voice in whether a discussion topic is a computer science topic.

My major was computer science. 

I graduated at the top of my class. 

I received offers due to my computer science bona fides from just about every defense industry contractor including a jobs at NASA as astronaut liaison helping design avionics for the latest commercial crew carrier spacecraft, writing electronic warfare software for another, writing weapons systems software on aircraft carriers and submarines, writing flight simulation software, writing firmware on the F-15, the F-35 and many, many more.

After working on the global systems architecture team at the time what was the  the worlds largest tech company, 

I left to start a software company that addressed a specific problem in the government law enforcement agencies. The software that I 100% designed and wrote is now running for every three letter agency in the US government as well as almost every state and local law enforcement agencies. The reason it is the solution of choice is because of the fundamental principles I learned as a postgraduate in computer science.

I am currently working on another software project that is 100% computer science. I live and breathe computer science at its core every day.

Why, if I post a discussion about software design, do moderators here remove the software design topic as being not a computer science topic?

117,Beauty of Software Engineering," 

This might not be the right place for this but I'll share anyway. I feel as though a lot of us who got into computer science and more specifically software engineering went into it from a place of love and passion.

I'm not sure where along those lines for me at least, it became about making more money and working less. I started hyper-fixating on total compensation and work life balance, which I think are completely valid reasons. The issue here was, I started losing passion for Software. It started becoming more and more of a chore and less and less of a hobby. What started as an escape for an 11 year old from the reality of life. A world where he has full autonomy and complete creative freedom. Has now become a 25 years olds chore, being micromanaged by people who've haven't touched a single line of code in their life.

I'm slowly beginning to realize the importance of actually enjoying your work. Focusing on fulfilment and value instead of compensation and stock options. I think that's a lot more powerful and a better way to progress in your career. I want to go back to building cool things and making people smile. Instead of hyper-fixating on retirement and investment (both of which are still important, but not end all be all).

I made a video about this if anyone else feels the same way, I also hope someone actually finds some value from this post.

138,"Understanding ""The Art"" of Building Proper CI/CD Pipelines With Examples on what you would or would not replicate in the CI/CD Test Pipeline. What are some things you would test in your backend.","1) Test Databases 

Would you run integration tests against preconfigured (Data/Schema) Databases in a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline pass the test database credentials and host them as environmental variables to your tested application? 

Would you do this using a database image after executing a SQL script to create your raw data.

2) Test Message Queues, Pub-Sub, Streaming Systems

Would you spin up a Test Kafka Broker and do the same thing as above, but run a pre-configured script to produce messages (To Test a Broker) or consume messages (To Test a Consumer),  in response to API calls (for example)

Or would you leave this to mocking

3) Authentication

Realistically your application's response can only be tested against real users and Application Responses to Real Users.

Say You were using OIDC, Would you use one of the following techniques to test your API responses

a) Create a Fake User in your real OIDC Provider 

b) Create a Test OIDC Provider (Keycloak Instance) create users in it, and configure your app at runtime through environmental variables / command line arguments to use that OIDC SSO Provider.

c) Configure your Application with a Different Authentication mechanism  to bypass OIDC

4) gRPC / other RPCs  between Microservices

5)  S3 Or Other External Data Stores

139,A job in CS that involves more coding and solving real-world problems,"Hi, I'm currently a high school student and would like to study CS.

I read that some software engineers don't like coding and therefore are happy when they can move into management. With AI becoming more and more integrated into the development cycle of software and the fact that software engineers these days have a lot more management and client communication to do than actually writing code, designing architecture or creating algorithms.

Since writing code and coming up with new or faster solutions to problems is something that I really enjoy, I worry that by the time I'll be ready to work as a software engineer, the amount of these tasks will have decreased even more. Don't get me wrong, I know that stuff like meetings, presentations, client communication, etc. are necessary and I'm fine with doing these things. However, I still want to actually solve real-world problems. If I wanted to become a manager, do phone calls all day and only use my computer to work with the glorious MS Office Suite, I wouldn't need to study CS... :D

167,Too much of a dilemma,"Sorry for the long problem statement :(

I am from a tier 3 college, currently on the verge of 3rd semester completion. 

I am learning Flutter, learnt upto API integration to a beginner level and currently making more projects using firebase. 
I am facing a huge confusion, I don't want to be in that 4-5 lpa spectrum as a fresher

I am not asking to become an SDE and get a 20-30-40 lpa package. 8-12-13 lpa as a developer is enough for me. 
(These were my expectations even when I was in the JEE phase aiming a tier 1 college) 
Problem is, I want this as a fresher. 

How do I achieve this, I am keeping a 1.5 yrs of time limit since companies start coming from 4th yr starting. 

Are data science/ML roles so easy to get as a fresher, considering my maths upto 10th is good, but +2 and engineering mathematical aptitude is not that good?

Is it possible for a fresher from a tier 3 to get 8-10 lpa as an APP DEV or a BACKEND DEV or a Fullstack app dev?? (I don't even know if that is a role, I searched but didn't find any openings for full stack app developers)

How is it possible? brute force?? By making as much as possible projects. Or by integrating ML in my app? 


Say I made 10 good projects with good fundamentals of the language and framework and got 8/10 lpa and someone with 3-4 projects would get 4-5 lpa? I am ready to shift to kotlin if needed. 

Is this doubling of CTC possible or am I daydreaming and need a reality check? 


Also my college doesn't allow internships, also, semester breaks are very short",1704525665,367137,Chemical_Bunch_4972,t2_6oe01r4ff,ff5889496f70fa03fe512b474c8f1330f30c1f5e2d21924379e2bfda1925e99c,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/18zueq2/too_much_of_a_dilemma/

202,From Talks of Promotion to Layoffs,"I had worked for a company for 2.5+ years as a full stack developer up until being let go as a result of, ""budget cuts."" I'm confused, and quite demoralized. 

I had started my time at the company as junior and entry. They took a chance on me as someone who did not have a degree. Instead some sketchy but usable demo projects, and a an education as a bootcamp grad turned temporary bootcamp instructor. 

The work was demanding, expectations were high, and the necessity to be as lean as possible meant that it was the sink or swim on boarding that required you to be self learning and quick. 

My boss would meet with me regularly, I'd ask how things were going and he seemed fairly positive, even so far as to suggest that he was interested in promoting me depending on how I performed during my now last year at the company. 

I was a grateful, and eager individual that wanted to repay them for that chance they took on me. I'd spend many all nighters helping my team reach out sprint goals, churning out quite often the ENTIRE front end work for our sprint goals single-handedly so that I could learn and help out in the work the senior devs preferred to do. 

To me it was worth it as a compensation for taking on someone like me. I was tired, I still am... So when I went into my end of year review and was told that I was being let go to cut costs... I was so confused. 

So here I am once again. A fool with no degree, now deprecated and unusable old portfolio projects that looking at them now I would be embarrassed to represent myself with.... Realizing I have to once again find some sort of miracle alternative universe where people don't immediately toss resumes with no degree.

I mean, sure a diophantine isn't easy to solve at all and can get really complicated, but Wolfram Alpha can surely solve it quite fast and that too for insane values.

and

>k(47)\*g(-5)=237

Essentially I want to solve for variables such as g and k in the context of one another and all the equations (the equations are much more complex - I am simplifying for clarity).

Is this a feasible approach and if so how would I go about achieving this? In addition, is this doable if I want the product value to be within a set number range? For example,

>k(47)\*g(-5)= a number from 217-257

216,Computer Science Undergrad or Master's w/career change,"Hey everyone! I am starting my journey into my CS degree pretty soon and tbh I am very nervous. For background, I have graduated with a degree in Graphic Design and work at a non-profit museum in my city. I do not like Graphic Design at all and I do not like my job because it is a career dead end. I do not have the passion to continue anything in this field so I am completely done with it. 

When I initially started my undergrad, I was a CS major but I dropped it because I did not feel that I belonged, due to my lack of experience and exposure up to that point. That and I went to a very rigorous middle/high school that had completely burnt me out on education in general. Long story short, I change to an ""easier"" degree just so I could be the first person in my family to graduate college and say I have a degree. 

Fast forward to now, I just turned 26, I still live at home and I dont make enough money to move along in my life. After 3 years of thinking about it and off, I have decided to take some foundational courses that will lead into me possibly getting a master's at my local university.

Am I making the right choice? Should I just go the route of getting another undergrad degree? Keep going for the Master's? Should I be doing this at all? 

Even now that I have already paid for some of the classes I need, I am unsure if i am going the right route. The one thing I am sure of is that I want to pursue a career with the knowledge I learn in school and online.

223,"I have never been a part of the team that actually finished a project, and I have a question","For the context, I am a front-end developer for the last 3 years ( Vue.js )

I have never worked in a big company, I was mostly freelancing and was a part of couple different startups ( don't remember the exact number, say around 10 ). I have never seen a single project succeeded, all of them failed for whatever reason, I still have access to the frozen Github repos of those projects, and this is driving me nuts, because it's depressing to think that I've never been a part of something that actually worked...

My question is, how often is this a case for you guys? because for the questions like ""describe the challenge and explain how did you overcame it"" I almost never have an answer that would spotlight me well, because most of the ""challenges"" I was having was to build and display some data in the dashboard, or make some multi-level user access for certain parts of the application etc - trivial things.

For the record, I have never had a task given to me which I could not handle, and not very often but time to time I would even refactor my code to optimise it, and while I am clearly not one of the best developer in the world, I tend to think that I am neither below average, but based on my personal experiences, every project I worked on failed and therefore I tend to think that I am also the part of the problem ( even if unmet deadlines were never the reason of stopping the funding of those projects ) .

232,Is my idea an efficient way to solve Boolean Satisfiability problems,"Well, throughout this text I assume that 1 and true as well as 0 and false are analogous, and will only deal with the numerical aspect of the truth variables. They can be converted back post all the mathematical calculations.

A few notations: My Boolean variables shall be x, y, z, i, j, k.

AND function: a, OR function: o, NOT function: ' (I shall use function, though others may call it an operator)

eg (x a y) o (i a j')'= (x AND y) OR NOT(i AND NOT j). Operations by order of parenthesis.

I will slowly build up my argument as points for better verification:

1. I guess we can all agree that with operations only on 0 and 1 (an odd and an even number), the and function acts as multiplication, atleast in value preservation(or based off on parity; that's how I took it)

To show what I mean

0 a 0=0, 0 a 1=0, 1 a 0=0 and 1 a 1=1; Similarly 0\*0=0, 0\*1=0, 1\*0=0 and 1\*1=1.

2. We can agree that by DeMorgan's Laws: x o y = n(nx a ny)=n(nx\*ny)

&#x200B;

Let's take a random Boolean Satisfiability problem:

((x o ny) o z) a ((x a (nx o y) a z) = 1 (odd)

Converting it to multiplication, we basically get:

n((nx\*y)\*nz)-\*-((x\*n(x\*ny)\*z)=odd (part a and be separated by hyphenated Asterix)(sorry for the awkward convention)

Obviously, both parts should be odd for product to be odd.

a. This implies (nx\*y)\*nz is even. So, atleast one of the conditions x=odd, y=even, z=odd is satisfied.

b. Since the whole thing is odd, x, z should be odd and x\*ny is even. So y should be even since x is odd

So we get solutions for (x, y, z)=1, 0, 1.

Is this an efficient algorithm, since it primarily involves just math, something which computers have always been good at. Are there any logical fallacies that I haven't caught up with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please excuse me if my answer is somehow a pre-existing/inefficient algorithm. Since I am relatively new to CS

And I also know that this is not even remotely close to an 'algorithm', and is just more like a informal essay kinda thingy. I should have used pseudocode and whatnot, but as I said, I am very new to CS and I have no idea on how to write an algorithm and have no idea on how to calculate the complexity (have only done basic complexity yet).

Thanks a lot for your time.

257,Where should I start?,"Hello! I'm currently a freshman in college pursuing an english major, with intentions to go to law school. I'm beginning to rethink this however, and am now considering moving into computer science. I excelled in science and math in high school, but have absolutely zero experience in coding (unless you count 5th grade tech class lol). The base CS class offered at my school currently has an instructor that does not teach the class friendly to complete beginners. This is the course description:

""Introduces central ideas of computing and computer science, instills practices of algorithmic and computational thinking, and engages students in the creative aspects of the field. Also introduces appropriate computing technology as a means for solving computational problems and exploring creative endeavors. Includes weekly computer programming assignments, but assumes no previous programming experience""

So my question is, where should I begin and end? I need specific materials please, I've been searching reddit and all I'm seeing is, ""youtube videos and free coding websites,"" but I need names and links. Thank you SO much for any help at all. BTW, when I say ""end,"" I mean, what is considered the basic coding knowledge needed to succeed in a class like this, taught by a person who uses coding terms without the consideration that her students don't know coding?

268,What's this component?,"Hi there,

I did some DIY microscopy to make a close-up of a specific kind of rf filter for a teaching job. Now, this component below is definitely the closest to what I was expecting to find, the problem is that I forgot where exactly from the circuit board I pulled this chip before exposing its guts. So I can't check the schematic to see if this is actually the filter I'm looking for... OOPS.

So my question to you, what kind of filter is this exactly?

  
\- I believe with 90% certainty that all components I pulled off the circuit board were filters of some kind  
\- The size of the pictured component is in the order of \~1mm  
\- It's from the motherboard of a OnePlus 3 phone  


Let's see who's up to the challenge!

Love,

Aldo

I am the first line of troubleshooting and it support as well for them and anything I can’t fix I might get assisted remotely where they using a linux based terminal to fix various issues using command prompts. I take day to day data on tasks that take too long and malfunctions that occurred where (ex: door didn’t scan door properly so got stuck). This data is provided to engineers to adjust the program code to fix errors in tasks completion and to make it more efficient. They are teaching us the commands using Linux in 2 months so everything can be done from a computer to control and troubleshoot. I also work at geek squad as a general just it support.

299,Mathematical thinking and one's intellectual ceiling,"I was never able to get a proper education in Mathematics in my earlier days. Hence when I started my studies in Computer Science, I was amazed at how & why even simple things worked. It also took me a long time to understand things.

Much of it eventually made sense. By that I mean I could see how brilliant minds had come up with these theories and conclusions. Like understanding the workings of a magic trick after its revelation. This went on for many algorithms including recursive behavior and some divide and conquer methods including merge sort.

These algorithms were brilliant and completely beyond something I would ever be able to come up with, but they _made sense_ after I read and understood the inner workings and machanisms. Sometimes, it became really difficult to follow, like during modular arithmetic - but ultimately, it made some _intuitive_ sense.

I would work through algorithms by first reading a summary and then trying for weeks to solve it. Upon solving them I would check and see if I was somewhat close to correct. This would some how '_prove to myself_' that I was good enough.

However, upon coming across the algorithm of quick sort, I was completely taken aback. I had never come across such an _unnatural_ and _unintuitive_ way of thinking. Sure, I can tell you how it works, but I would not be able to even imagine or approach a solution in such a manner. Even after coming across advanced algorithms like those of AES Galois Counter Mode, Aho-Corasick, etc, which were well beyond me, I could not shake off quick sort (Hoare's partition, not Lomuto). It is still an algorithm I could spew out, but _don't really get how someone could think up_. I went on many forums, but no one really understood what I was trying to say. They would say, ""Read it, and memorize it"".

Perhaps this could be due to the fact that this way of thinking is _very_ natural for trained mathematicians who had a good base since childhood. Even Sir Tony Hoare did not publish the algorithm at first due to him thinking it as being _too simplistic_. I even asked a mathematician, ""How long would it take you to figure something like this out?"" and they replied, ""This is pretty simple once you've learned about something known as 'invariants'"".

At this point, I am simply wondering, is it really that simple a concept, and if it is, what mathematical education would give me such skill to see these as simple? And does finding an algorithm such as this difficult to imagine mean I have reached my ceiling of capability? Having a learning disability all my life made me work really hard trying to be as capable as a normal person. I never seem to get the satisfaction of being '_good enough_'.",1704871675,367827,two_six_four_six,t2_k6jesfd40,cc0d86c88428d5ffe5773e1e251f27556f9a08b18ec47d8246830c0bbfe1c13d,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1932o2t/mathematical_thinking_and_ones_intellectual/

319,FWA ISP took almost all 192.168.0.0/16 private subnet,"Hello!
Networking is not so much my subject so please forgive me if mistakes happen

In these last days I'm configuring a little media server and was allocating some IPs to my containers etc

I discovered through a arpscan that I am in a huge Lan in 192.168.0.0/24 and 45k hosts are responding/taken on 65k

Now I don't know (and don't think) this is how you project a net on large scale (without even allocating some private addresses to each user), not even using the 10/8 subnet but the smallest one..

Now the issue is my antenna is 192.168.1.1 and I tried a setup with two routers where I did manage to have a working Lan in my house (10.0.0.0/8) and everything working, now obviously I would like to avoid heaving two routers but the gw address must be in my Lan subnet

Now I don't know what to do, if exist some ways to have a gw not in Lan (Ie: 10.0.0.0/24 my lan and 192.168.1.1 my gw) if other solutions I do not know exist and my archer C6 is not allowing me a gw outside sadly..
As you may understood is not a so covered area and I'll do my best to change provider asap, sadly I'll have to leave my hometown in 3 days and have to at least temp fix for now 

Thank you all in advance for any suggestion

328,Dyanmic Arrays question (Neetcode),"I'm studying dynamic arrays on Neetcode and encountered an inconsistency in the Dynamic Arrays video regarding the counting of operations during array resizing. When adding a second value to a dynamic array of size 1 (initially containing one element), the textbook counts 2 operations: one for moving the existing element to the new array, and another for adding the new element. 

However, when adding a third element to this array (now of size 2), the textbook counts 4 operations: one for creating a new array, one for moving each existing element (2 operations), and one for adding the new element.  
Why are the operations counted differently in these two scenarios? Shouldn't the process of creating a new array and moving elements always be counted consistently, either as separate operations or as a single operation? 

I know it's somewhat irrelevant, but I'm trying to understand the rationale behind his difference in counting methods. 

Any insights or explanations would be greatly appreciated!

So I am doing a potentially cra,y experiment/project. Basically I have created a function that can map all 2.6 million poker hands to a unique value.

I want to precompute all these values and put it in to a perfect hash table , for quick poker evaluation, by taking this unique input and generating an index that stores the actual rank of the hand based on some other analysis.

I'm just curious, is this feasible with a hash table? Or should I be looking into a different data structure for storing this stuff.",1704999937,368087,DevelopmentSad2303,t2_g3qiujfpm,e8886da48cd2d5ab1afc4170ddd5bc84c675d3219cd3059df4fd841709543e1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1949kvf/perfect_hash_functions_questions/
350,Best (& fastest) way for nontech startup founder to learn CS?,"For context, I’m a nontech founder of a tech startup planning to apply to YC S24 batch which begins in July. At the moment we do not have a technical cofounder, so I have taken it upon myself to learn as much coding and programming over the next six months as possible so that as we build our product (a mobile marketplace) I can have at least a baseline of fundamental knowledge while I work with developers.

The problem I’m running into is that majority of the advice I’m encountering is oriented toward job acquisition, but I’m not looking for a job I’m looking to learn the skills needed to build my app and website (I’m also generally a pretty fast learner). I’m aware of no-code tools, however the limitations and co-ownership of ip is problematic for me, so we’re hoping to custom build everything from scratch.

My goal is to eventually be considered a full stack technical person in my company. I know this is lofty and not likely in 6 months, but I think I’m capable of at least making substantial progress on basics. can anyone offer some advice on the best course of action they’d recommend to fast track learning? I’m looking at the Odin Project, freecodingcamp, and harvard csx right now, but also considering a legit bootcamp. I’m also a black female so if anyone knows of programs that offer scholarship for underrepresented demographics please share.

Any advice/personal anecdotes are welcome. Thank you! 🙏🏽",1705000799,368092,queefsadilla,t2_bn6pmd7l,b2cbf7aff2655627b745c210f283b03f5ebcff8f89bc08fd4ce38d257e395bbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1949wwd/best_fastest_way_for_nontech_startup_founder_to/

I have completely 0 experience about coding even tho I got a PC myself and now im just asking a question if whether its fine to start now in my senior or am i too late?

382,Should i get a CS Degree?,"Hello!  
Im 24 yo from Russia but working as QA Analyst 2 in USA for big company. I got bachelor in Civil Law in Russia. But never used it because once i graduated i moved to US and took QA course and found QA job where I'm working now.   
I love computers and all these stuff. So i wonder if i should get CS degree, but the thing is i do not know math, because it was never needed for me as a lawyer, I will have to learn it from basics (stuff from high school i.e Geometry, Algebra and then Pre-calculus) Which im actually ok to do and ready to spend most of the days on it. But i wonder if it's worth it.   
Im looking at jobs requirements and there are always saying either degree OR n+  years of experience.   
So may be i should just not waste time to learn math but i should pick the skill needed for the work i want to do and just learn them?   


Im so lost and have no idea what to do. I would like to hear what you guys are thinking and probably your experience.

Ever since we started noticing how good of a “team” we are when we code together. We recently had a university project that we finished almost entirely together (due to other team members disappearing ) , the way we approach coding is very different, yet when we think together we almost get to build a puzzle out of our thoughts that paints the big picture(we literally used a white board to merge our thoughts), examples: i code a function that would make his code  easier for him, he would help me understand notions i didnt know about, i would code a bash script to help him with a specific task , he’ll find that missing “break” in my switch that almost made me lose my mind (c language am i right?)

Weird thing is I dont actually have a One drive application, so im not sure how the one drive folder popped up in my file explorer in the first place. Anyway i find a way to stop syncing to my device and the minute i do that all my files that were in the one drive file in my file explorer are removed from this device. They still exist online if i log in to One drive, but im not sure how to move them back. Ive tried downloading them but they are as a compressed zipped file. I currently dont have a desktop file and and all the files in the desktop, their contents are gone. Not sure what to do - just realised i have no idea how cloud storage works :( If anyone knows how to fix this, would be great. Thanks!

I hope Im posting in the right community. If not, I'd be grateful if you could direct me to the proper one.

I have to prepare a presentation about [Peppol](https://peppol.org). Peppol is an infrastructure that makes possible secure Electronic data interchange. They basically provide network, to which end users can connect to and send to each other business documents through Access points (access points are companies, who are service providers for this).  


Part of the presentation includes me explaining what are AS2 and AS4 communication protocols. I also have to explain what asymmetric encryption is and how it fits into this whole story of Peppol and EDI.  


In the instructions I was given is also ""Documents standard: XML"". I have to explain the documents defined by Peppol and give some examples. I'm not sure if this refers to documents as in how a document is structured as it would be on a paper (e.g. when i write a contract - where i put the parties, the subject matter, the date etc.) or is this ""document standard"" another IT term that I dont understand.  


I searched through the internet and read about AS2 and AS4 protocols as well as asymmetric encryption. I understand the concept of asymmetric encryption but I cannot understand how it fits into the context of Peppol, I have a slight idea but no where near enough to make a coherent presentation. Regarding AS2 and AS4 I literally have zero clue about what I read on the internet. There is a lot of abbreviations and technical stuff that I just dont understand.   


I would be extremely grateful if someone could explain to me these concepts in a way that a person not in IT and CS can understand, since I also have to make this presentation in user-friendly way.

425,developing AI clothing combo app,"Hi, I am working on a business project with a team. Our idea is to create an app where people can upload the clothes they own and artificial intelligence will create a new outfit combination for them every day according to the users' tastes and needs, and show them how the combination looks on a person in 3D. The app should work as follows:

1. The person gives their height and weight, body type (providing exact measurements which can be later modified by the user), and a 3D model of the person's silhouette is created, or the person can scan themselves (there is already such an app).
2. The person chooses their style (streetwear, classic, opium, y2k, tech wear, gorpcore, etc.).
3. The user then triggers the app with his/her existing clothes.
4. The app creates a new outfit combination every day based on the clothes available, provided style preferences, ocassion and weather conditions.
5. The person rates the outfit on a scale of 1-5 stars, thus making it easier for artificial intelligence to learn their preferences for future combinations.
6. The app would have a window where people could buy clothes and the person could try on the clothes virtually before buying.

We are searching for someone qualified to help or advice us on the ways of finding specialists to make the project work. Some technical advice to make the whole coding process easier are also welcome.",1705161892,368484,TheStrangeMindGirl,t2_4qpnzt53,ddcf512c48890f02624ca2fa0c477a597990b40cba713332c544c86c192ddd12,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/195r8vy/developing_ai_clothing_combo_app/
426,What is The Best Way to 'Learn React'?,"I've always disliked the idea of becoming proficient at a particular framework without understanding the core concepts and technologies underneath the hood. I want to learn React, but I want to understand it in a way that is transferrable to any Javascript framework. All of the teaching materials I have found so far are far too Bootcampy and focus wholly on teaching you how to use React to create some follow-along project. I dislike these because I don't feel as though I emerge with any greater understanding. For example, if the version of React I'm using differs from the tutorial such that the API of the tutorial is no longer compatible, I am unable to follow along because I have gained zero knowledge about what my general development intentions should be and I lack the insight necessary to effectively debug my problem.

433,Can In-Order Cores and Co-Processors Execute Instructions in Parallel Without Data Dependency?,"I've been reading up on CPU architecture and I have a question about in-order processing in cores and co-processors. Specifically, I'm curious if an in-order core and a co-processor can execute instructions in parallel when there is no data dependency between their tasks.

From what I understand, in an in-order execution model, the CPU core processes instructions in the sequence they are received. This means if an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction, the core has to wait until that instruction is completed. However, I'm not sure how this works when a co-processor is involved.

Can the core and co-processor work independently on different instructions at the same time, as long as there's no data dependency? Or does the in-order nature of the core affect the co-processor's execution as well?",1705176415,368527,Few-Employment-1462,t2_iswlal03,31b246a53e0d5ac327926c7ec1b127d99859a912eb97dbd3b4e43d226db93d81,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/195wu2z/can_inorder_cores_and_coprocessors_execute/

457,Too old to learn CS?," 

Hi guys,

Is it too late?

I'm 22, and I am considering a career or at least learning Computer Science. I have basic background in High school Math and physics. I consider myself to be analytical and philosophically-inclined - I loved math and especially physics in high school. Due to the specific situation I had when choosing my major, I ended up enrolling in a Biology program. Well, Biology even helped me be confident in my family business environment, but I already view this as something not to be worthy following. Instead I think those things will be more useful that make my thinking/learning abilities better.

I suppose modern times have shown more that memorization or memory-based degree programs will not be that useful and profitable as ones like physics or computer science (actually, Elon Musk has talked about it).

I'd like to hear your suggestions, in particular, about my age which is 22 and whether or not it is possible to get a career in CS or related through learning online - without a university degree.

Or is it like - I had to start programming at the age of 13?

The interviews are not a sales pitch, but rather me trying to discuss the current experience of potential users and collect that information into a future product. They should be no longer than 15 minutes.

505,Checking Number Is Power Of 2,"There was an LC question asking to identify if a number is a power of 2.  At first I thought to just repeatedly multiply but then saw others had identified a bitwise check as the more efficient answer.

I recognized at first that the bitwise check would be more efficient, but I wanted to know if theoretically the two approaches would have the same time complexity.  People acted like this question of which “theoretically” was better was totally stupid and said computers do bitwise operations in O(1).  Someone even said my question was stupid (after I tried to explain “theoretically” in terms of the number of operations a Turing machine would need in the worst case) and that I had no understanding of time complexity.  Left a very bad taste in my mouth.

Am I totally off here?

Thinking about it a bit more, I’ve reasoned as follows:

What computers do is irrelevant for the theoretical question.  However, if you fix the input size as in a computer to 32 or 64 bit integers, then I think the complexity for both repeated multiplication and bitwise checks should be O(1), though the latter will have a much better constant.

If you don’t fix the input size, then actually the bitwise should be more efficient theoretically, because it is just O(b) where b is the number of bits in the integer, whereas multiplication would be something like O(b^3) — you have to go from 1 bit up to the number of bits and each multiplication should be O(b^2).

So that answers my question I think.  Even theoretically it is much less efficient check by repeated multiplication.

It just really rankled me because I don’t think it was a stupid question — and though there are aspects of time complexity that I don’t understand, I think I have a basic grasp of the concept (will admit framing in terms of Turing machines probably isn’t relevant — a human would need the same number of ops too).",1705345425,368864,Certain_Note8661,t2_ej2fkmlvw,6f61048d2b27f35156cbd322fc893730626a46e44e5ad58bf4c34e019337b996,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/197gsj6/checking_number_is_power_of_2/

521,looking for study advice,"Hey everyone!  

I am thinking about making a career change to ICT, but I am really inexperienced in the field. I do have a knack for computers and figuring things out, and I am prepared to invest some time (between a few months to a full bachelor, but the faster the better of course) to get into the field.

Unfortunately I do not have a lot of overview on which kinds of exact jobs there are and what the exact requirements are for these jobs. I was hoping that if I make a short list of the kinds of things I ope to find in this sector, that you might be able to give me some tips where to look. That would be much appreciated!

My job does not have to be my great mission in life, or something that I get all my meaning from, I am actually already doing quite well on those topics. I am just looking for something that I can do for a good part of the week, create some financial freedom, and have enough time and energy for some other projects (I studied music before this, and I would like to be able to continue with that)  

Skills / character traits:

\- Creative

\- Analytical / conceptual thinking

\- Leadership

\- Integrity

\- Planning and organising

\- Assertivity

\- Social

\- Independent

Important factors for the job:

\- something that is not the same action every day. I like to figure things out, have different kinds of tasks and assigments

\- decent salary

Less important factors for the job:

\- some personal flexibility (flexible working times, or just assignments that have to be done at a certain moment)

Wikipedia page for [symbol (data type)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(programming)) says:

547,A tangible way/path to succeed and excel as a future programmer,"Okay so to start

profile: i'm 17(high school student/teen) this is the first year we are studying computer science. All the basic stuff algorithms a little dabbling with surface-level python , js ,HTML and basic concepts on computers and programming 

Questions :

1-What is awaiting me in the next 5 years of my life so to say from now till universty

I kinda feel lost rn and there is just so much information and so much to do that I'm just doing nothing but I'm eager to learn and practice..but I really really need some guidance be it just general tips or full paragraphs of advice and I feel like the words computer science, ethical hacking, developers are just thrown around me with these big salaries and lifestyles but I never got to see the journey or path which is the only thing interesting me and I can't seem to find an exact answer made for someone in my situation. and I don't want to graduate in two years and then be pressured to figure out what to do next. I want to start planning and working from now

2-How could I as an individual improve myself and my skills and find a path that suits me :

For example what books could help me go from the very low level that I'm into making me a confident (in my knowledge) and capable programmer things to do except just trying to do good at class things outside of that that could help me become outstanding after several years of hard bonus work also like courses or channels to follow (like I'm considering taking the cs50 course on yt provided by Harvard) of course i don't expect to suddenly become an expert in a few weeks and I'm willing to follow any long and hard path it..just got to take from the start to an endpoint unlike some yt tutorials that take things for granted or just present solutions(also i have no access to websites like Coursera or anything paid since I'm in a third world country that does not offer online payment options)

3-What would be your recommendations/advice to someone my age who is starting a little late in terms of taking care of themselves externally and wanting to improve in this domain

570,Online-based Computer Science Bachelors Degree?,"Around 2021/2022 I dropped out of my BsC (Hons) Computer Science with Web Development degree. It was when Covid-19 was more prevalent and so we were studying from home. I was finishing my second year, ready to jump into my final year. However I dropped out due to personal issues and a feeling of lack of support from the university.

&#x200B;

Since then I have been job hopping and not enjoying a single one of them, whilst also seeking apprenticeships, I've had a feeling of not fitting in anywhere since leaving uni and I always circle back to looking into self-education through online IT courses, and/ or looking for IT apprenticeships, I haven't been successful in landing any of these but as I said I always end up back at wanting to pursue a computing career.

&#x200B;

Anyway my question is, is this a sign that I shold go back to uni, start from scratch and get my CS degree? (I am now 27 years old btw). Maybe this is what I need to do to get my sense of belonging? My only concern is adding on to my already existing student debt, especially now that I am a bit older and considering mortgage applications etc.

What I have realised is I don't like working with people. 70% of the time I end up with people who are smart but won't put a SINGLE effort until the day before.

The other 30% of the time I end up with someone smart, which is nice but they make you feel useless, that your ideas are crap. Someone once removed my code and did it in a more complicated way. The person had helped me and was nice so I let that slide. 

So I have decided to work alone but I am kinda very scared it will be hard? But this time the professor seems to kinda wants us to work alone even tho he didn't say that. The other times prof say ""it is impossible to do it alone"" (50% of the time it is a lie). Also how to refuse if someone asks me to work with me.

573,"Unveiling JWTs: The Problems Solved, The Journey from Passwords, An Architectural Example Needed.","Forgive the verbosity of this post, but I find myself deep in a cryptic conundrum in the face of JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). As I explore the many facets of modern web development, I’m prompted by the continual resurgence of JWTs in my learning journey. In awe of its increasing relevance and usage, I would like to untangle my confusion and become proficient in understanding and implementing JWTs.

JWTs are tokens designed to transmit information between parties as a JSON object in a compact and secure way. Predominantly, I've learned that they are used in the realm of user authentication and secure information exchange, but can someone enlighten me in granularity? Precisely, regarding the key problems addressed and solved by JWTs?

Authenticating users, indeed, is an integral part of almost any application and has evolved significantly over the years. Not so long ago, username/password and cookie-based session were the most prevalent incumbents in the realm of user authentication. Yet, with the demise of the world-wide monoliths and the rise of decentralized applications, in particular, the dispersed SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and microservices architecture, I sense a shift in the authentication paradigm. But how did we navigate from those traditional passwords concept to JWTs?

In an attempt to comprehend fully, I'm also earnestly seeking an architectural example to grasp this concept better. For instance, having an API with a specific method for login and one for token generation, and having it ‘talk’ to a frontend application would help immensely in understanding JWTs conceptually and practically. 

Let me lay out a scenario that might serve as a basis for such a walkthrough. Suppose we have a user-based application; user credentials are stored securely on a database. The user logs in via a frontend application (let's say, built with React), which then sends a POST request to the backend (let's say, Node.js API). The API then verifies the user credentials against the database.

From here, how do we integrate JWTs into the process? Where would the 'method for token generation' come in? How does the front-end application handle the received token? How is this token used on subsequent requests to the backend? Ideally, how would the backend/API handle such a token? If someone could illuminate this process in a step-by-step guide, I'd be immensely grateful.

Moreover, it would be immensely beneficial if we also delve into the realm of token expiration and token refresh, and how they are designed into such architecture. How do we handle the potential expiry of JWTs issued in an ongoing session? 

I am keen to receive your comprehensive perspectives to broaden my understanding and fill the gaps. Your valuable knowledge, insights, and experiences can really help to bridge my confusion. Thank you!

TL;DR: I'm seeking in-depth insights into the problems JWTs solve, how we transitioned from password-based authentication to JWTs, and a practical, architectural example of implementing JWT authentication.

My gratitude in advance.",1705495305,369188,Formal-Move4430,t2_p1036vrl,abac6e581f937d33d940246ccd0ccd96e8d00bf3a2d53b2b8c5ddc1bd70eb86e,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/198vnzu/unveiling_jwts_the_problems_solved_the_journey/

588,Management of multiple template project,"I have this scenario on a project I'm working on.
I have a contract administration spa that I'm building for different forms of contracts.  This means there are different communication documents with different fields.

If a project has standard form 1 (sf1) it may have the following document template

General communication
Application for payment
Notification of events


But another standard form of contract let's called it sf2 has the following

General communication
Instructions
Early warning notifications
Payment application


Each of these documents have different fields and each contract can only have certain types of document.
Should I manage access to seeing these templates based on a cookie jwt which holds data about that specific form of contract to then allow the user to see the menu and forms for those pages or would there be a different hierarchical approach where the user will access say
/Sf1/(contract number)/instructions page?


I'm looking at something that is easy to manage but also flexible to allow say a special template module for example an RFI form that can exists on either standard forms. But also the ability to enable different styles of RFI for example a design RFI or a legal RFI.

I'm just thinking ahead of the structure as I've got the majority of the crud sorted and I'm working on the authorisation aspect of the front end and backend.

I'm thinking of generating contract specific jwt that allows the user to perform actions and the such as a user can have access to 10+ contract of different forms.",1705513269,369232,bramburn,t2_lzrzy,af4c0de9416a5d23e7ce613d0c2719d3ad74b28c7da5bbcab9ff8ad1ea64b5f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1992k2s/management_of_multiple_template_project/

 I'm surrounded by people who were always successful in math/programming competitions, while I always finished last in them. My friends manage it with no problem, but I want to be like them too, I'm just not as above average as they are.

I'm actually looking forward to next semester's classes, but I also feel like I won't be able to pass the exams. I can't shake this feeling for a long time.

How to regain hope and motivation, and actually pass them all?
And what do you think, can only brilliant people succeed in computer science?",1705596936,369423,Emuna1306,t2_elgy6czg,12f3f7f9a6d1d069d71aeaf1b97cb031b4518ddd09eb493495bb0e7d30c79c70,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/199upld/should_i_give_up_studying_it/

627,"Here's another question titled ""Should I study computer science?"" but I am a 28 yo software developer with two years of experience","The only thing I need to know is if the education received is worth going to school for it.  


I am self taught with 2 years of experience working professionally as a software dev. I landed a job at a terrible software development agency a couple years back, then moved on to frontend with react, and now working full stack nextjs typescript redis and go. I deployed a betting platform with some sports startup. This is all to give you an idea of my current level, I am good not great with javascript in general, decent with go, I know dsa and can deploy crud apps with ease.  


I want to become great. There are a lot of concepts which intrigue me that I have no idea where to start looking. I would love to know just where to start if I want to create an os with rust, for example. I don't know what a kernel is or all the complexities associated with low level software engineering.   


I feel like javascript and web development can take me pretty far, but I want more. I know I'm good but I fear I need to study to become great.

634,Need Tracking Ideas,"I’ve built an application that shows users daily deals at restaurants. We built an admin platform that allows restaurants to create an account, upload and post their deals to our user base via our iOS and android app.

The biggest issue we’re facing right now is that the restaurant cannot track who is coming in from the app because we don’t require the user to purchase the deal in app. We’ve essentially added a “claim deal” button on the user side, that when a user clicks it the restaurant can see on their admin dashboard that theirs been a claim - but they technically don’t know if that user has come in to get it if it’s a standard daily deal.

We’ve thought about geo fencing the restaurant and adding location tracking, or a potential QR code solution that the user can scan at the restaurant. 

Does anyone have any other ideas that’ll help us track these conversions? TIA.",1705633070,369512,Brizup,t2_7elte5ja,189275a563d8f1d714b29a51e1d656a415ede96d7e92399fd5e6eaa9abce2cd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/19a8rcx/need_tracking_ideas/

With available resources including a KVM Server and four computers, I'm seeking your advice on making this lab dynamic and effective for them who prefer to learn with their hands and by “doing”.

(Additionally, the University's cyber club will also have extended access to this space, catering to traditional students. So, I'm not only looking for ideas tailored to military service members with a 16 week turnover period, but also for ways to engage traditional students with a strong academic passion.

Your input on tools, software, and configurations would be invaluable, considering the diverse needs of these two groups. How can we make the most of this setup for hands-on learning in networking, cybersecurity, and server administration? Share your thoughts please!

668,I am an aspiring filmmaker and I need a computer science expert to read and review my latest screenplay.,"Hello guys! As the title says, I am an aspiring writer-director for film. I haven't published or produced anything yet as I just recently graduated college, but I spend a lot of my free time developing and writing projects to be made in the future. One such project is a feature-length (about 80 paged) screenplay called ""Computer Mike."" This is a comedy about an out-of-touch man who gets sucked inside of a computer screen, and his friends who scramble to get him out. 

I just completed the first draft, and one thing I want to pay attention to in all subsequent drafts is if the science makes at least partial sense. Not only is the titular character based partially off myself being slightly out of touch from the modern computer world, but at the end of the day, this *is* a fantasy story.  Things don't need to 100% reflect the way they work in our world. My worries primarily come from any references to real-world programs & computer stuff. Characters reference computer viruses, crypto-currency, data siphoning, ISPs, file sharing, etc. 

I want someone who can read excerpts of my script (or the whole thing if you'd like), and tell me if there's any information that is just straight up *wrong*, or if there's any information that should be changed.",1705703125,369671,FrickinNormie2,t2_bi1i8r4z,ddb4ebdc66f6d60564ff8e5e1ff6373d430b93a6bf00b214f42b04024577bb75,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/19avngb/i_am_an_aspiring_filmmaker_and_i_need_a_computer/

685,How and where does a binary number get converted to decimal representation?,"I learned how computers work back in the '80s, which revolved around the 6502. I mostly worked on basic software since but recently I got interested again at low level programming. I am happy to see that basically everything still works the same only having added complexity to it. But there is a question that never occurred to me in the past and I can't get a clear answer on, so I hope someone here can answer it?  


I know that binary data that represents an alphanumeric character gets converted using a Unicode table (I am assuming these days it is done via a font-file as opposed to the ASCII character ROMs of old?) This file will probably have some code to instruct the video driver to draw the corresponding glyph.  
But how does a computer convert a binary number to a decimal representation? There is no direct relationship between e.g. 6489 and the 6, 4 and 8 glyphs (there is arguably for the 9). So how and where does the conversion from 6000 to 6, from 400 to 4 and from 80 to 8 take place? I assumed the CPU might have a built in converter (BCD perhaps or some algorithm?) but perhaps this is the OS job?  I can find no info on this.

I started learning html, css, js. I learned js but I donno how to implement them, what kind of projects I should make and where to find like-minded people to grow my connections.

Doesnt help that I'm not mentally fine and the only thing that's helping me recover from this state is studying but here I am confused.

I want to form a good community, rn I'm stuck with people who are too lazy or aren't interested.

Please help.

719,How does compile time memory allocation work?,"Hello, I'm trying to understand compile time memory allocation and it does not make sense to me, let me explain what i think it is:lets say we have the following C code:

    int main() {
    int a = 5;
        return 0;
    }

it assembles into a lengthy assembly code and it has this line:

    movl    $5, -4(%rbp)

Basically saying subtract 4 bytes from the stack pointer and place the value `5` at that address. My confusion is, when this assembly code is converted into binary, static memory allocation happens, or it has happened already at the assembly code part, now if the binary has the machine understandable equivalent of `movl    $5, -4(%rbp)` it means that binary already contains the value 5 right?, and when that binary itself is loaded onto memory: the call stack of the OS when it is being executed, isn't the instruction to load the value 5 into memory obsolete? since the value 5 is already part of the binary and it is already sitting in the memory.   


I understood the static allocation process like this, the binary contains all the values,   
ie: 0101000010`00101`00010101010100101 (Assuming this is the binary for simplicity sake)  
 it is loaded onto memory and the OS tells the CPU to run the program by changing the IR register to point to the starting address of the program. Why are me allocating memory by updating the stack pointer here when we already have the value 5 inside the binary. for dynamic allocation, i understand that we need to move stuff onto memory into the heap, but for static, im lost. I hope i explained my question properly, sorry if i sound dumb. thank you very much for any kind of help.

726,"Found this on my USB I ordered on amazon, should I be concerned about time travelers in my computer?","Hello, I have recently made an discovery. I order USB 5 pack on amazon and I find that there is strange words in it. The usbs are all different colors, Red, Blue, light blue, red and blue (Purple) and the usb with this file is black. Is this some sort of color theory? I am scared.   


The date is from 1078 so i kind of want to open the file and see if there are any signs of time travel. The name of the file also makes no sense. i feel like it may have been created by an alien. Or maybe in the future people speak like that. In that case, the size is about like... 4 million killabytes? thats probably at least a gigabyte. i know personally I have about 20 gigabytes of porn on my computer so it seems a bit too small to be a future hentai porn stash...   


Any theories on what this could mean? I know personally I have never dealt with something like this before. i am currently attending college to study network design so I know at least a little bit that time travel is real. (Time to live on packets, obvious signs of time travel.)   


But Im confused, if jeffery Bezos had access to hidden files from the year 2078 does that also mean that Cyber punk is real? I think that could also be a fair assessment. Anyways, I know Jeff Bezos will probably track me down after making this post but that is okay because I know at least 4 combos in street fighter and should be able to defend myself.   


Any insight would be helpful.

756,Question about the meaning of T(n) in recurrence relations,"Let's say I have a recurrence relation so that 

`T(n) = T(n - 1) + 1 for n > 0.` 

* To find `T(n - 1)`: I take `T(n)` and `-1` from it. This gives me `T(n - 1 - 1) + 1`, or `T(n - 2)`. I take that `T(n - 2) + 1`, and add it to my original, to get `T(n - 2) + 1 + 1`, or `T(n - 2) + 2`. 
* But now I need to find the `T(n - 2)` in `T(n - 2) + 2`! I repeat the same process. 

I believe I understand this point. 

&#x200B;

**My question is this:**

Is `T(n) = T(n - 1) + 1` = `T(n - 2) + 2` = `T(n - 3) + 3` = ... etc.? 

In other words, is it *just as* correct to say that `T(n) = T(n - 1) + 1` as it is to say that `T(n) = T(n - 3) + 3`? 

To put it yet another way, `T(n - 2) + 2` is **equal to** `T(n - 100) + 100`, and I am just providing T(n) in a bunch of different ways, kind of like `n * n` is the same as `n^2`?

760,Best way to simulate Low-Field MRI from High-Field MRI,"Hi fellow computer scientists,

&#x200B;

I'm trying to trivially simulate Low-Field MRI from High-Field MRI. I'm wondering if any of this options is valid. If so which one is the best?

&#x200B;

A) Let's consider we have a 3D High-Field MRI image:

1. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Undersample k-space with mask -> Apply IFFT
2. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Downsample k-space with bicubic interpolation -> Apply IFFT
3. Apply FFT to obtain k-space -> Center crop k-space -> Apply IFFT

&#x200B;

B) Also, in case of low SNR in Low-Field, I can consider larger voxels during acquisiton. We want the same FOV (is this okay, right?). In such case what will happen to k-space when compared to an acquisition with smaller voxels? Let's consider we have a 3D High-Field MRI image with size 512x512x512:

1. The new k-space, with size 256x256x256, will look like a downsample version of the k-space acquired with smaller voxels. Similar to option 2.
2. The new k-space, with size 256x256x256, will look like a center cropped version of the k-space acquired with smaller voxels. Similar to option 3.

777,Knowledge v. Degree: Is being a CS major more important than knowing the actual skills to code?,"I was accepted to the University of Washington, which is a big name in the CS field in the last admission cycle. But the issue with it now is that I have not got my student visa to study there as an international student. Upon attempts to get visas from all the countries I applied to, I finally got my student visa from Canada and now am studying in Queen's University while keeping my student status at the University of Washington by doing stuff online.

I want a career in the CS field so now it is a serious dilemma for me. The CS program at Queen's is not considered prominent. Waterloo and UBC have some better programs in this field. The pro is that at least it is a CS degree that is reachable or say not too difficult to get, unlike a CS degree in UW. It is extremely difficult to get into a CS major as a freshman at UW because you need to apply for it again and the requirements are harsh. So going to UW would mean that I may not get a CS degree after all.

But here is a good thing about UW or U of Washington. You can learn a lot of high-level CS courses as a non-major. Although you will never get a degree with 'CS' on it, but at least you can get prepared for a CS career with the necessary knowledge. The downside is also obvious, without a CS degree but only courses, there will be troubles when you apply for a job or graduate degree.

HERE is the most important question: What is the path I should choose to walk on now if I really want a CS career? Do I go to UW with a moderately high possibility that I will get a non-CS degree while also knowing how to code and I can get a big name in tech fields? Or do I study in a Canadian uni with a higher chance of getting a CS degree?

779,A new form of markdown.,"Hi,

This is not an advertisement, but just a showcase of something I've been working on for a while. I read the guidelines, but do not know what an *IAmA* post is. But here goes, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this.

I am a rather disorganized person and have some form of learning disability in processing information 'normally'.

I found regular markdown and other forms of markdown languages to be rather limited *for my use case* so I developed a simple syntax of sorts to help me organize data in a form that I found to be easily digestible/ recognizable into meaningful partitions. I call it the A1V markdown language and a sample of it is presented in the image below.

Apart from regular markdown features like tables and text formatting, it allows for text coloring and highlighting in any 6 digit hex color code, presents a line-numbered code section to manage snippets (no code highlighting as of yet), images to be inserted in base64 string form, superscript, subscript and integral format as well.  It has sections that are blurred but made visible on hover, sections tagges as warning, note sections, etc. as well. The syntax makes use of programming chars used most often so it is very easy to get up and running with (at least for programmers). i'm working on making it useful for the wider community with support for histograms, formulas, and graphs and charts and mathematical notation (this obviously, would pale in comparison to great works like TeX). Due to HTM5 being prevalen and fairly mature, we can make use of these technologies to make organization of information more palatable to the eyes.

It is a very miniscule and humble undertaking but I'm satisfied with it so far. It helps me manage my info and snippets. I will release a public version soon and I wish to incorporate suggestions and features from my fellow people. Please share your thoughts.

781,AMD vs Intel CPUs (Cores/Threads),"Hi. I come from the pc gaming community. In this community, people explain less about how things work and more about the fact that they do work. So currently for myself I do a lot of heavy gaming in 4k 60/120hz. I also do a lot of scattered web browsing and care about video streaming/watching quality.    


Currently I own a I7-13700K. However right now, the AMD 7-7800x3D is being hailed the best of the best for gaming. It would next me some extra FPS, have a lower power draw, lower thermals, and have a new socket.   


However i'm wondering what i'll miss from the intel platform if I do switch. Everyone always frames it as intel is better for workloads and AMD is better for casual stuff and gaming. But WHY?  


I have very little background knowledge about how pc parts actually work. I've been trying to learn about cores and threads. I think I got the super basics. Also learned about cpu cache. So I think the 7800x3d is better for gaming due to its 3D cache. This makes sense.  


However id like to understand why is intel good at what it does. And what else might it be better at, even by a little? For intel people talk alot about multi threads for work loads. Or its E cores. So how do these things work? Why does the multi or e core not seem to matter for gaming?  


If I have 10 tabs open on chrome, will a multi threaded core be able to process those more smoothly than AMDs, who people contribute single core work to? What about for streaming videos where diffrent visual effects might be used?   


Thank you for all the help!",1705982845,370313,RiteOfKindling,t2_te6wxn5z,62e389ca1d6be40dbdcdb5a20350d94f7b503e8daed7a6b8d226afe5725adf82,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/19dfm4l/amd_vs_intel_cpus_coresthreads/

Hi all! I (17F) am a senior in high-school taking an IT course. Unfortunately, my teacher is very old and not very proactive in our learning, causing me and many other students to not have a great understanding of the material. I try to keep up and study, but have been struggling.

817,"How exactly do 8bit,16bit, 32bit etc; CPUs differ from the others?","I’m having trouble grasping this for whatever reason but can someone explain simply how , for example, an 8 bit CPU would differ from a 32 bit CPU?  From my understanding an 8 bit CPU has 8bit wide registers, 32bit has 32bit wide registers and so on.

So maybe for each CPU, we can represent that register with an array[] holding 8 bits or 32 bits 

With that said, let’s say I wanted to add the two numbers 100 and 5

How exactly would this operation differ based on the CPU ? How would the size of the array or register affect my computation and execution time? Does a 32bit CPU simply have the capability to handle more instructions or is it more so able to process more data per clock cycle?  Is this the reason why a 6502 cpu has a much smaller instruction set compared to an 8086?


Wouldn’t it not make a difference if the instruction/operation was simple and could be represented in either 8 bits or 32 bits?  With that said wouldn’t a larger bit width register size lead to increased fetch decode and execution time for a CPU if it has a bunch of empty/non useful data it still needs to loop through?

831,Random Graph Generation Algorithm,"While a seemingly simple looking task, when you dive deeper for an optimal algorithm, we discover various intricacies of this task.

Textbook algorithm is fairly simple, if we need a graph with N nodes and M edges, just keep generating random edges and add if not already present till we get M edges, while this may work great for sparse graphs it becomes inefficient really quick as graph becomes denser.

The problem becomes even harder if we want the graph to be connected, the base step is to generate a random spanning tree amd add remaining edges randomly such that they don't repeat.

This problem is essentially to sample some edges from complement of a set where the universal set is the set of all possible edges, in a way that they don't repeat, we use Floyd's Sampling algorithm for it, the end result is a mathematically random graph which is optimal in worst case, you can check out the implementation.

854,Suggestions to tame complexity in hierarchical state machine?,"I'm working with a hierarchical state machine which seems very large to me -- 15 leaf nodes, and 5 parent nodes (example of hierarchy included below). The number of states makes it difficult to understand all the interactions, and putting all the state transitions into a single diagram is a nightmare. I suspect that the state machine could be simplified, possibly through:

1. reducing the number of states.
2. restricting the kinds of transitions that are allowed.

I'm hoping for advice on how to do either of these, or more suggestions for how to tame the complexity in the state machine.

I've searched for suggestions regarding ideas (1) and (2) a bit already. I expected there would be some heuristic to determine when states should be combined to reduce the number of states, but I haven't found anything about this. I also haven't found definitive agreement on idea (2) -- I think I'd prefer if leaf nodes only only handle transitions to direct siblings, and anything more complex needs to be handled through an ancestor state, like what is described here ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50182913/what-are-the-principles-involved-for-an-hierarchical-state-machine-and-how-to-i](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50182913/what-are-the-principles-involved-for-an-hierarchical-state-machine-and-how-to-i)).

I am currently studying computer science (BSc), but I am considering switching to a degree in computer science and statistics to broaden my options, such as in the fields of AI and ML, upon completing my degree. While a combination of computer science and mathematics seems to be the most popular, my interest lies more towards real-world applications than theoretical ones. Therefore, statistics seems to be a better fit for me.

Please, share any advice or thoughts you have. Thank you.",1706171990,370717,soacm,t2_86qoreo18,dc27dafe302c1f591734186a4d2eb957e06e8878a8ac6582c24d890ec625ab18,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/19f4vb4/switching_path_from_computer_science/

I knew going in that I wouldn’t go as deep into either subject since it’s a double degree, but so far, the only real CS related stuff I’ve done is: intro to compsci, object oriented analysis and systems design, one course in programming, requirements engineering, information security, ERP systems and HCI. No math at all. No algorithms. No data structures. I don’t really feel confident or comfortable saying I’ve studied CS when it feels like I haven’t even touched a lot of the stuff the comes up here.

880,I wanted to learn computer science and enrolled...,"I wanted to learn computer science and enrolled in Bloc's self paced SE program and this is what happened:

The industry mentors they hire have full time jobs, families, hobbies etc. You will not get a mentor who is teaching at Bloc full time and wants to teach 1:1. You will have a quick meet and greet session on Zoom or Skype with your mentor but you will learn they have other more important things going on during the week. Communicating with your mentor will be hell or join the program chat group and hope he or she enters it. If you have any questions or are stuck they will barely make any effort to text or message back in time. I was not expecting to hear back in minutes or hours but it took days to get a response.

&#x200B;

The 1:1 weekly meetings as mentioned in the syllabus should last an hour and cover course material and questions, but they hardly do. The mentors can get away with making them under 30 minutes or even 15 minutes if they want. Meetings also get rescheduled. I had a second mentor cancel our friday meeting because he was going to ""silicon slopes"" (seattle) for the long weekend. So I was going to have to wait a full two weeks before I could get any type of face time feedback from my mentor. This brought me to the realization the mentors are doing this only as a side hustle. It's extra cash flow to pay the bills and they are not at all going to teach you anything or help you along the way.

&#x200B;

The programs they sell cost a lot of money (15K - 20K) and its basically cut and pasted from other free online coding websites. Yes the entire design layout is different, but the program structure is basically identical to codeacademy, udemy, lynda (before they were bought by Linkedin). You will have no original Bloc/Thinkful practical coding exercises geared towards helping you learn how to build applications. They even tell you in the syllabus to complete codeacdemy tutorials before starting. Why would anyone pay 15K to enroll in a program and then be told to go visit a free coding website?

&#x200B;

[Bloc.io](https://Bloc.io) does not care about you. They will not give you any money back if you are rightfully unsatisfied with the program and mentors. If you try to explain yourself or say you do not feel its right and want answers they will just forward your email to another team member. You will read emails that say ""this is our last correspondence."" You basically have to hire an attorney to fight for you if you want any money back.

&#x200B;

The [bloc.io](https://bloc.io) staff are not professional. One staff member included me in an email chain by accident where they literally typed ""he just keeps saying we are like udemy and wont pay lol."" When I finally got a hold of my program advisor during business hours via skype and wanted to discuss mentor’s rescheduling and not communicating for days he said “Im driving on my way to the hospital family emergency.“ Sketchy.

&#x200B;

[Bloc.io](https://Bloc.io) does not have any public company contact number listed in NYC or SanFran. If you want to call your mentor or a student advisor its not possible. If you want to book a meeting with a student advisor in calendly its not possible. It is only Facetime, Skype, Zoom or email. This is by design.

&#x200B;

In closing do not make the same mistake I did. Do not give this company any money do not take out any loans to enroll in any [Bloc.io](https://Bloc.io) program. They ask upfront to pay $9,975 or pay the deferred tuition and the full tuition can go up to $17,918 or month to month payments at $2100 ($12600). Do not be fooled by [bloc.io/chegg/thinkful](https://bloc.io/chegg/thinkful) when they say we will empower learners to enhance their career prospects and venture into new roles like never before. This is a mother f\*\*king joke. Almost everyone at this company is a con artist trying to make a quick buck.

883,Your advice for a sophomore CENG student," 

# 

Hi guys, I hope you're all doing well. I'm a sophomore Comp. Sci. & Eng. student in a technical university. I will be doing my first internship next summer.

So far, I've taken these department courses: Introduction to CENG Concepts (General concepts, algorithms and basic Linux, python knowledge) |C Programming (as the name suggests :D) | Data Structures & Algorithms (C++ used)

The reason why I gave this information is : I started coding at university, no pre-knowledge. I can say all my ability only comes from programming assignments & labs I've done during above courses. When I ask someone from industry what to do extracurricular, they say very shallowly : do your own projects and upload those to Github etc.. I wonder exactly what type of ""projects"" these are. What would you suggest me for extracurricular activities? (I want to take action about this in my 4-week semester break, especially for my first internship.)

I'm currently a second-year computer engineering college student, and I'll be taking a subject on software design in the upcoming semester. I have a question:  
  
1. Is learning Java Swing GUI beneficial for software design, or should I hop into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?  
  
I'm currently studying the fundamentals, data structures and algorithms (DSA), and object-oriented programming (OOP) in both C++ and Java. Java was my first language, and I later transitioned to C++ for DSA as per my professor's requirements. I've gained an understanding of memory management in C++, which has provided insights into how memory management works in Java.

It's simple enough, but now looking at it, if I had analyzed the question, I would have chosen that ""Algorithm B"" is growing faster"". The reason why I would have chosen ""Algorithm B"" is growing faster"" is because ""Algorithm B"" refers to the denominator. So if the denominator is growing faster than the numerator, then we approach 0 right? If ""Algorithm A"" (the numerator) grew faster, wouldn't we approach infinity, not 0?

The same goes with decommiting, why is it better to leave memory reserved than to release it completely? Why not release every time and just recommit it the next time?

For context, this is my first semester and our intro to computing course is split over two semesters. First semester is variables, branches, loops, etc. Second semester is memory, pointers, stacks/queues, recursion, etc. all using C++.

For the record, I'm not claiming that it's too easy for me or that I'm at all an expert, but when I look at coursework from more highly regarded institutions (i.e. Berkeley CS61A) I feel like I could be getting a deeper understanding of the material if I knew what resources to use.

The CS organizations/clubs also aren't very active, so if there are any good online orgs or anything, I would like to join one as well (maybe even start one here)

951,Why don't CPUs expose all physical registers in their instruction sets?,"I have heard that high performance CPUs have more registers or register files than their instruction sets would suggest. They perform [register renaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming) to eliminate false dependencies.

However, because the instruction set only allows access to a subset--for example, x86-64 has 16 general-purpose registers--compilers already have to use complex register allocation algorithms to get the fastest assembly code. Already, the compiler has to convert the code into [Static Single Assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form) (SSA) form, renaming variable whenever they're modified, and then the values of those variables map to 16 general purpose registers.

But if at runtime, the CPU is already renaming registers, which seems like a form of register allocation to me, I don't understand why the instruction set limits the programmer/compiler from making use of this information so more register allocation can be done at compile time, making the CPU more efficient.

Alternatively, if the answer is that ""runtime register renaming produces better results than 100% compile time register allocation"", and that compilers just aren't as good, then why should registers be exposed at all? Why not have the assembly be something like SSA form, and let the CPU decide which register to use, and let it spill to memory only when it needs to?

I can think of a couple potential reasons, but they're just guesses of mine.

One reason may be backwards compatibility. Intel and AMD want x86-64 CPUs to run 32-bit x86 code, which was also a limited register architecture. This I can understand.

Another reason may be so that processors suited for high performance can run the same code as processors optimized for low power usage, which might not do any register renaming. But that would leave me wondering why there aren't exclusively high-performance supercomputer instruction sets that do have hundreds of physical registers exposed.

My final hypothesis is that it could be just to save space. If you exposed 200 registers, you would need 8 bits to specify one particular register. Assuming 3 operand opcodes, that would mean 24 bits are taken up by register operands. RISC architectures tend to have uniform 32-bit instructions, so that would leave only 8 bits to specify both the operation and the addressing mode. Otherwise, they'd need larger opcodes, which would take up more memory, and because memory latency is often a bottleneck in high-performance computers, it's worth introducing complexity in the CPU hardware to do runtime register renaming instead of just programming all registers directly, simply to reduce fetches from memory.

But in the end, I don't actually know. Is there anyone with expertise about that does?",1706391736,371255,cloudyearnings,t2_dmbfubz1n,519403699d45db0aec7626ddf31f8908acc6fdecda33e52a7cc82d01b8337763,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1acls7q/why_dont_cpus_expose_all_physical_registers_in/

I know it may sound impossible but I got to stuff that are a bit close so I wandered if there's any solution to this problem.

Example:

list is [1, 2, 3]

Set(index=0, value=7)

list is [7, 2, 3]

Set(index=2, value=1)

list is [7, 2, 1]

Set(index=0, value=10)

list is [10, 2, 1]

UnsetN(2) list is [7, 2, 3]

Thus, at the end, Get(index=0) returns 7

Some additional info:
I thought I would just clarify some of my attempts to solve this problem.

I tried to create some sort of stack/list of lists, but then I had to choose between deep, shallow, or lazy copy. Deep copy didn't work because it took O(n) average time, shallow copy didn't separate the arrays' instances so changes in the new array transferred to the old ones, and lazy copy merged the 2 problems by sometimes making the operation take O(n) and sometimes (in some other implementations) making new changes effect the old list instances. In lazy copying, there are also cases where I would store the changes in a different location (like a tuple or a list) but that would make UnsetN take O(n) average time).

I also tried storing a map of changes for each index, but I got to the understanding that, though the UnsetN operation could return one element in O(1), it cannot return the rest in O(1) as well. I tried to solve it by using 1 counterall indexes combined, so the first change would be tagged as change 0, the second one with change 1, and so on. The problem with this approach is that I want to revert the list to a certain counter, but there are cases where I can't obtain each index's version up to that counter in O(1). For example, If my current counter is 4 and my changes map is: {0: {0: 5,2: 9, 4: 6}, 1: {1: 7, 3: 8}} And I want to revert the list back to counter=2, I can know index O's value easily in 0(1) by doing changes_dict[0][2], but I can't obtain index 1's value in the same time complexity.

I thought about making a kind of ""Holed List"" whereit doesn't contain all indexes but I can still obtain thelast index before my requested index in O(1), but Idon't know how to do that (maybe something math ormemory related?), so that's where I got stuck.

Thanks for everyone that can help, if something is not clear please ask me in the comments :)",1706519375,371586,winmy1,t2_3tje5dn6,f5bb9432a94120acaca3d6f17a87ce7b8817264200e1b9c6a4c143e9abbf6486,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1adr37o/unsetn_o1_data_structure_help/

I want to change my major to cs. This means i will graduate next year (i have been taking a few cs classes before making my finalizing decision). This means i will have only this summer to get an internship.

1035,Looking for help on an alternate version of Twitter,"These are the basic rules. What do you think? 

1. **Prevent Redundancy**: Limit the posting of a statement to a single instance. Repetitions or variations will link to a dedicated page devoted to analyzing this belief.
2. **Classify responses**: Rather than generic replies, responses should be classified as specific content types, including supporting or weakening evidence, arguments, scientific studies, media (books, videos, images), suggested criteria for evaluating the belief, or personal anecdotes.
3. **Sort similar beliefs by**:
   1. **Similarity**: Utilize synonyms and antonyms for initial sorting, enhanced by user votes and discussions about whether two statements are fundamentally the same. This enables sorting by similarity score and combining it with the statement’s quality score for improved categorization.
   2. **Positivity or Sentiment**: Contrast opposing views on the same subject.
   3. **Intensity**: Differentiate statements by their degree of intensity.
4. **One page per belief** for Consolidated Analysis: Like Wikipedia’s single-page-per-topic approach, having one page per belief centralizes focus and enhances quality by:
   1. **Displaying Pros and Cons Together to prevent one-sided propaganda:** Show supporting and weakening elements such as evidence, arguments, motivations, costs, and benefits, ordered by their score.
   2. **Establishing Objective Criteria**: Brainstorm and rank criteria for evaluating the strength of the belief, like market value, legal precedents, scientific validity, professional standards, efficiency, costs, judicial outcomes, moral standards, equality, tradition, cognitive test, taxes (for presidential candidates), and reciprocity.
   3. **Categorizing Relevant Media:** Group media that defends or attacks the belief or is based on a worldview accepting or rejecting the belief. For example, just looking at movies, Religiosity is a documentary questioning the existence of God, Bolling for Columbine is a movie that criticizes our gun control laws, and An Inconvenient Truth is a movie that argues for action on greenhouse gases.
   4. **Analyzing Shared and Opposing Interests**: Examine and prioritize the accuracy of interests said to be held by those who agree or disagree with the belief.

What do you think? I have a bunch more rules, but wanted to know what you think before I went too far. 

I believe, we need collective intelligence to guide artificial intelligence. We must put our best arguments into an online conflict resolution and cost-benefit analysis forum. Simple algorithms, like Google's PageRank algorithm (whose copyright has expired), can be modified to count arguments and evidence instead of links to promote quality.  

However, I wanted to describe the general framework before I get to any of that. I would love to hear what you think!

1050,"CS master's degree interview/exam, need help!","hello everyone,

I'm a mechanical engineer with 4 years of work experience after my bachelor's degree. 2 months ago, i made a big decision to switch my career into software programming. I always loved computers and tech in general, so i finally went for the leap of faith to work at something i'd enjoy.

Currently, i'm learning python from udemy and youtube. Been 2 months so far and i built a solid foundation on programming. I wrote codes for simple games, APIs, web scraping etc. (angela yu python course). After those bootcamps, i'm planning to solve all free leetcode problems and prepare my portfolio website as well to apply remote jobs for programming.

To improve my knowledge and gain a title, I decided to apply for master's degree. Next 3 weeks, I'll get into CS master's degree entrance exams and interviews at 3 universities. The problem is, I have no idea about how to pass those exams and convince the jury at interviews.

Now, I don't expect to learn the entire CS bachelor's degree in a few days here, but I still wanna increase my chances to get accepted. Below are the subjects of the exam and their lecture books :

* Computer organization (Mano-logic and computer design fundamentals)
* Operating systems (stallings pearson-operating systems, internals and design principles)
* database management (henry f.korth-database system concepts)
* Introduction to CS (h. cormen-introduction to algorithms)
* software engineering (mcgraw hill-software engineering)

I already know that odds are against me. They expect me to know the basics to pass the exam. However, I've read their master's degree regulation and it says that for students who doesn't have CS bachelor's will be taking extra courses from bachelor's curriculum on first year to fulfill their lack of knowledge.

If someone who has been through CS master's degree exams, or anyone with CS degree could tell me what would be the most possible questions they might ask, basic topics that I need to know about etc. I appreciate a lot.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting to learn everything in such short notice. There is a quota for 10-20 students in total, and they take the students by their exam/interview scores. So, even if I can't make it to first 10-20, I will still have a chance by being at the spare list (not all of the students are registering due to various reasons).

1055,"CS master's degree feeling lost at careers, need help!","Hi everyone, first time posting:

I have recently finished my master degree in CS last year (my bachelor was also in cs), and is ready to start my careers. Being said so, I start to feeling lost after last job, a tech support at real-estate agency. I quit it mainly because of it was not related to what I've learn in Uni (my main task there was to automate existing excel sheets with some small scripts) and I also need to communiate a lots of things not even related to computer and is far less related to what I imaged.

It has been a month since I resigned from my last company,  feeling very confused now. I understand that strengthen my data structure and algorithm foundation is nessesary, but I am still stuck at the easy level of leetcode. I spent some time this month learning front-end knowledge, because my understanding of the back-end was ""you need to learn some front-end knowledge first"". But now I suddenly found that I didn't know what I really should do, nor was it clear timeline planning.

Due to personal reasons, I was not able to participate in any internship projects during school, and never touched the real software development workflow. This month I rewrote my resume and submitted it to 30+ companies, but no interviews or positive responses yet.

I could tell a bit more of myself: I am ***very*** bad in math and barely passed my calculus in first year, never touched anything related to math after that and don't feel like confident doing related jobs. Ideally, I thought I might be doing software development but I have 0 idea where to go. My tech stack is: python (most of my master project are done in python, so are some of my daily scripting), java (0 backend and web programming knowledge) and a few other like C# and js. Only thing that might save myself is my bachelor grade is relative good but not my master grade.

Here are a few of my mainly questions:

1. What should be my target job as I really don't favor into backend/frontend/security/IT, any of them heavy (Learnt data mining/data communications in master but are not very good), and should I focus on finding grad or full-time job? If I do have a direction I may could just start buidling projects and profolio.
2. If I need to have any timeline plan, such as learning xxx in a few months before seeking or synchronizing?
3. Should I be keep codecamp to learn front/backend etc, or should throw myself hard into leetcode?
4. Any detail you might want to know.

Opening to any suggestions and resources I might need, much thanks!

Can I someway, modify the software of the NVR? It should be really about hiding a tab, so not a big deal. However, I don't see version of the software published anywhere.

1064,Switching into CS from Engineering?,"Hi everyone, I thought I could lay out some thoughts and y’all could provide feedback on if this achievable and what steps I could take.

I recently graduated from a top public state school with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering Technology. Right after graduation, I began work in the defense industry doing design and quickly realized this is not the career I want to follow. I had many doubts during school and continued with my degree anyway, but this confirmed it.

I’ve always had a passion for computers and the limited (2) python courses I took during my degree were rather enjoyable and came to me quite quickly. I really like the puzzling aspect of figuring out what’s wrong with a bit of code and the process of fixing it.

I would really like to switch to the computer science industry, likely as a back-end developer. Would this be achievable given my position? Additionally, what steps could I take to get started in this industry? I have been looking into the IBM certifications as a great way to get started, but I was wondering if y’all had any additional advice.

Since this happens after a finite amount of time, only a finite amount of information could be derived by the computer.

1128,Opinions on Data Science Bootcamps (and my current position),"So a bit of background about myself:  
I recently finished a Master in Computer Science (I have a Bachelor degree in Economics) from a reputable university in Europe (specifically Spain). However the program lacked any sort of direction. I have always been interested in Data Science but it's been really hard landing any jobs since my portfolio is definitely lacking (couldn't build a proper DS portfolio during the master). Also, I honestly need more knowledge in order to pass the interviews and would love to dive in deeper into the field. The question is, should I join a Data Science bootcamp? What are your thoughts? Ideally I think a bootcamp is great because:

1. I learn better in a structured, non self taught environment
2. They help build a good portfolio
3. Networking and job hunt help (supposedly)
4. Chances of landing a DS job increase

1129,Efficient sorting when comparison is the bottleneck,"I'm writing a commandline application for sorting files based on subjective, user defined criteria. So for example, let's say the user wants to sort cat pictures by cuteness. My application would repeatedly present two cat pictures to the user, and ask them to select the cuter one. This would be fed into a comparison based sort behind the scenes, resulting in a list of cat pictures sorted by cuteness

In this design, the comparison would be the most time consuming part of the sort, by far, so I need to choose an algorithm that minimizes the number of unique comparisons. I say unique because I could apply a simple dynamic programming trick and keep a map of comparison inputs to results, so that if the same comparison comes up multiple times, I can simply look up the old result instead of asking the user to compare the same pictures again

I've also thought about extending this to comparisons that are ""indirectly"" computable based on previous comparison results. So if I'm presented with two cat pictures `a` and `c` that I haven't compared before, but I have determined that picture `c` is cuter than some other picture `b`, and I've also determined that picture `b` is cuter than picture `a`, I can deduce that `c` is cuter than `a`, and avoid asking the user to compare them. I could probably also extend this recursively, chaining indirect comparisons in order to find redundant computations.

So my question is, which sorting algorithm should I use? Does my idea of finding redundant computations by comparing existing comparison results affect which algorithm would be optimal?

1142,Is this possible?,"I am not a coder at all, ive dabbled but my knowledge is extremely limited and i'm well aware that if i have a random idea, the probability that it is original is close to 0. However i had an idea and if it is any good it would be a shame for it to go to waste. Again id like to clarify this is coming from a place of extreme ignorance and lack of knowledge on the subject. 

I was thinking about a tv show and a dude high on this drug put back together shredded documents for the FBI to help solve a case. I thought, what if a program could do this? I asked AI to write up pseudocode for the idea with a bunch of extra information and things to consider.   


It came out with this:  
Advanced Pseudocode for Shredded Document Reconstruction

**Input:**

* Shredded document images (front and back) in high resolution
* Optional: additional context (scene photos, witness statements)

**Output:**

* Reconstructed document image (if possible)
* Confidence score for reconstruction
* List of potential matches and associated probabilities

**Algorithm:**

1. **Preprocessing:**  


* Convert images to grayscale (optional)
* Enhance contrast and sharpen edges
* Remove noise and distortions

1. **Feature Extraction:**  


* For each fragment:
   * Extract edges and contours
   * Identify text regions (lines, words) using OCR or segmentation techniques
   * Calculate texture features (e.g., smoothness, entropy)
   * Extract color information (if relevant)
   * Estimate paper thickness based on edge strength

1. **Matching:**  


* Define a similarity metric considering:
   * Geometric fit (overlapping edges, matching contours)
   * Textual content (OCR results, letter frequency analysis)
   * Texture similarity
   * Color compatibility (if used)
   * Presence of snags (e.g., interlocking edges)
* For each pair of fragments, calculate similarity score based on the defined metric
* Employ a probabilistic approach to account for missing information and uncertainties:
   * Use Bayesian inference to incorporate context information (if available)
   * Implement Markov Random Fields to model spatial relationships between fragments

1. **Reconstruction:**  


* Find the highest scoring matches using a global optimization algorithm:
   * Simulated annealing
   * Branch and bound search
   * Genetic algorithm
* Iteratively merge matching fragments based on their positions and orientations
* Refine the merged image using inpainting techniques to reconstruct missing areas
* Employ context information to guide reconstruction (e.g., alignment with known document structure)

1. **Evaluation:**  


* Calculate a confidence score for the reconstructed document based on:
   * Overall consistency (e.g., number of unmatched fragments)
   * Plausibility of text content
   * Visual coherence of the reconstructed image
* Output the reconstructed image, confidence score, and list of potential matches with their probabilities

1147,Could someone give me a logical answer for this ? It's so bizzare .," I went to the supermarket today for 20 mins to grab something to eat . My girlfriend stayed home . She said that while she was playing Warframe my account logged in 2 times , invited her , and whispered to her in chat the following : '' ......... ........... ........... '' for a full chat window or more . She also said that my discord account logged in while she was on our server , entered the voice chat and she was hearing some sort of computer screeching or a sharp sound from it . Both my Warframe account and Discord went offline and online 2 times . I wouldn't believe this , but she managed to film for a short time , couldn't catch it all cause she was in shock , she is 100% a healthy rational person and never said anything like this in 5 years . I have to add this : Both my discord account and warframe account have 2 factor authenticator enabled , so anyone would need acces to my phone (which was in my pocket at the time) to do that . I also checked activity and there were no logins except for my usual IP and location. I will also add the fact that I am using a WIRELESS USB Wifi Adapter for my pc , which sometimes disconnects and connects again to internet on it's own since it's pretty old . My pc was on sleep when I got home and it requires pressing a button on the keyboard to boot . Some might know that sometimes discord is buggy and it might connect you to the last server you visited upon refreshing your network even though you have terminated that call previously , but I cannot explain both of them happening at the same time , and especially the warframe chatting , which was not only a usual squad message but a private one . We also have a cat that sometimes jump onto my desk where I have the keyboard , but what happened seems way too complex for that . Could someone please give me a scientific answer for this ?

1148,"Could you reprogram the human brain using the eyes to inject ""code""?","Im reading a book called ""A Fire Upon The Deep"" by vernor vinge (havent finished it yet, wont open the post again till i have so dw about spoilers, amazing book 10/10, author has the least appealing name I've ever heard) and in it a super intelligent being uses a laser to inject code through a sensor on a spaceships hull, and onto the onboard computer.

Theoretically, do you reckon the human brain could support some architecture for general computing and if it could, might it be possible to use the optical nerve to inject your own code onto the brain? I wanna make a distinction that using the ""software"" that already exists to write the ""code"" doesnt count cos its just not as cool. Technically we already use the optical nerve to reprogram brains, its called seeing. I'm talking specifically about using the brain as hardware for some abstract program and injecting that program with either a single laser or an array of lasers, specifically used to bypass the ""software"" that brains already have.

I think if you make some basic assumptions, such as whatever weilds the laser is insanely capable and intelligent, then there's no reason it shouldnt be possible. You can make a rudimentary calculator out of anything that reacts predictably to an input, for instance the water powered binary adders people make.

1165,Understanding How DNS Resolution Works When Accessing a Website 👇,"Ever wondered how your web browser knows where to find the website you're trying to visit? Let's break down the magic behind DNS (Domain Name System) resolution:

🌐 Web Servers and IP Addresses:  
Every web server is identified by a unique IP address, which is a series of numbers that computers use to locate each other on the internet. When you want to visit a website, your web browser needs to translate the human-friendly domain name into this numerical IP address.

💡 What is DNS?  
DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. It's a network of servers that translate domain names into IP addresses, making it easier for us to navigate the web without having to memorize numbers.

🔍 DNS Servers:  
When you want to visit a website, your device first looks for the site's IP address in the local, router, and ISP DNS caches. If it's not found there, the search continues through a series of DNS servers designed to resolve the domain name:

1. Root Name Servers: The query starts here. Root servers don't store the IP addresses of individual sites. Instead, they know where to find the TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers.
2. TLD Servers: These servers manage domains under a specific extension (like .com or .net) and can direct queries to the exact authoritative name servers for each domain.
3. Authoritative Name Servers: Typically provided by domain sellers like GoDaddy, these servers hold the actual DNS records for a domain, including the crucial IP address that your browser needs to access a website.

🔄 DNS Resolving Process:  
Let's walk through the steps of DNS resolution.

1. Device Requests IP Address: Your device sends a query to a DNS resolver (ISP's Recursive DNS Server) to find the IP address for a website's domain name.
2. Query Root Server: The DNS resolver contacts a root server, which responds with the address of the TLD server for the domain's extension.
3. Query TLD Server: The resolver then queries the TLD server, which directs it to the authoritative name server for the domain.
4. Query Authoritative Servers: The resolver retrieves the IP address from the authoritative servers.
5. Access the Website: The browser uses the IP address to establish a connection with the web server, which sends the webpage content back to your browser.

And voilà! The webpage loads on your device, and you can access the information you were seeking without ever seeing the complex network interactions behind the scenes.

1169,Advice for Beginners,"Hey everyone! I’m currently enrolled in a computer science program. Initially, starting at Python I felt pretty good and was understanding all the assignments and was able to complete them. The Java portion of the course was much more difficult and I spend so much time on assignments and often feel discouraged for being so slow/bad at coding. 

Whenever I scroll through TikTok/YouTube I see people solve LeetCode style problems so quickly and software engineers programming all day at their jobs. Just wondering if anyone has felt this way at the beginning of their journey. Any tips/resources to eventually get better at programming and manage these feelings of discouragement?",1706889921,372315,ganggreen16,t2_6clfjadf,5516a3b8800c1b06a9b6e59a103a5647510a3b9d87f5340058d2d9df42a78b62,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ah754v/advice_for_beginners/

1171,Using GPT-4 for Front-End dev.,"I am a front-end dev and I’ve been experimenting some ways to incorporate ai (GPT-4 specifically) to improve my skills and study on this field.

Ways I use GPT:

* **Quick answers**: I usually get stuck on weird CSS issues or some react bug that won’t budge. So I started asking using gpt like “why isn’t my flexbox aligning right?” or “what are the best way to handle state in react?. But yeah, sometimes, its hard to get the right answer too from AI.
* **Code review**: It's sort of amazing to see what comes up when I toss my code into GPT-4 and ask, ""Can you make this cleaner or more efficient?"" Occasionally, I've overlooked a straightforward solution; other times, it's a completely different perspective on the issue.
* **Keeping Up with the Joneses**: Front-end tech moves fast, so now I just ask GPT what’s going on atm.  questions like ""What's the latest in Vue.js?"" or ""Show me some new CSS tricks.""
* **Project Brainstorms**: THis is just prompting hoping to get some inspiration. Anything from basic questions to specifics in hopes of getting a breakthrough

Pros and Cons:

Pros

* Time-saving: I can avoid hours of frustration and Googling by finding quick solutions to difficulties.
* Diverse Perspectives: On occasion, GPT-4 makes suggestions for methods that I never would have considered. Keeps be from getting too tunnel minded
* Constant Learning: It helps me stay up to date with the newest developments in front-end technology and trends.
* Creative Boost: Excellent for when I need a new perspective on something or am at a loss for ideas for a project.

Cons: 

* Not Always Accurate: AI doesn't always get it right, especially with complex or nuanced problems. I usually have to double check things when I’m not sure
* Dependency Risk: There's a risk of becoming too reliant on AI for solutions and not strengthening problem-solving skills. I don’t want to be entirely dependent on a tool
* Ethical Considerations: THis is a bit murky. Some people have issues and some companies do too. There’s also the problem of IPs and other ethical problems
* Lacks Human Touch: I just psend my day talking to a screen. NO mentors or other colleagues at times, so feels disconcerting",1706891354,372318,GudbyeBlueSky,t2_fhzpd17y,8fcde1d2f0eebe2e445428e5c43f2a7d9cec1da8ef96c34b1951830c68e9ecff,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ah7ph4/using_gpt4_for_frontend_dev/

1207,Do I need to be passionate about CS to have a successful career?,"Greetings 
I'm in the verge of completing highschool and the major I'm going to apply to is CS. the primary reason for this decision is because of the flexible nature of the job, demand and it's financial stability.

However, i am not passionate about this field. I definitely don't dislike it, and the basic coding I've learnt at school is something I like, and I've learnt to see how coding could be fun. But is this something i intentionally do in my free time just for fun? Not really.

What I am passionate about is aviation (piloting) but the field's unpredictable nature and the sheer amount of time it takes to get to that position makes me want to take a more ""stable"" path, like millions of others. This is just a realistic approach.

1208,What is the best specialitzation to go for?,"In my case the subjects that I enjoyed the most till now are: first one Computer Oganitzation, learning how processors work, how cache memory hits and misses and general memory herarchy, also programming in MIPS with registers and all that stuff It just felt like I learnt a lot even if it was hard sometimes, second position goes for OS that was mostly an intro to parallel programming (threads, fork…), it was on C. In general everything I touched with low level languages and straight foward hardware related I love it. 

What jobs or specialitzations do exist were you work with making the code efficient (instruction level) and that somehow consumes/wastes less energy? What MS should I look? And what Interships or positions should I aim for?

I just can't seem to pick a thing and stick with it.

He has had to carry a minimum load due to his illness even before he was forced to drop everything this past winter.   He normally has very very high grades, however.   He created games on the Roblox platform as a young child that made a lot of money for him, which he has invested—- so he is capable of setting goals and attaining them unsupervised.

Thankfully I was a computer science major and completed the majority of the CS classes I need for computer engineering. All I need is to take an extra math class (differential eqn's) and all of the electrical engineering type classes. I am enrolled in classes as of now that are still relevant to my CE degree. I will start taking more of the CE type classes in the fall of this year. Are there any things I can do to get ahead in the electrical and hardware side of computer engineering? Also any certs or extra things to learn that may be relevant in the future. Also, I have the option to get a CS minor and math minor, I just need to take a single class in each to get the minor, should I do this or just focus on getting my BS in CE?

1264,One of those midlife-ish crisis',"I'm only 27 so maybe calling this a, ""midlife crisis,"" is overstepping it a little bit but...

I graduated undergrad in 2019 with a BA in Psychology. I'm essentially wanting to make the switch over because over the past year I've started doing some coding/programming in my free time and honestly I've developed what I'd call a passion for it. Even if it did come a little later in life.

In 2021, I enlisted in the Army (as infantry lmfao) and I'm still currently in; reenlisted for three years but after this contract I'm definitely wanting to get out and pursue a career in IT. I've decided on trying to pursue an online program for computer science while using my educational benefits while I'm still in. The program (and given I already have a few of the prereqs covered) would have me graduating with a BS hopefully just in time for me to get out and try finding a big boy job again. 

But I'd be lying if I said I'm not worried about a few things. By that I mainly mean math. I haven't done actual math in over seven years. Let alone even touching calculus. 

Do any of you out there have a similar kind of path where you had to basically reteach yourself the more advanced equations? 

If so, what are some recommendations? I'm ideally wanting to start my program in August of this year. I've looked into Khan Academy, but if anyone has any other websites or things that I could use to catch me up to speed I would be very thankful.",1707124733,372777,cornfedbigboy,t2_h4zihh50,7ef2efc59da8827b363369d7c0268399fa755c828644e7d2f985999491b7c603,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ajcgfp/one_of_those_midlifeish_crisis/

1287,Any CS Research Suggestions?," Hello!   I'm 23F and a 3rd year college student. I am currently looking for a   thesis topic that focuses on areas that are time feasible and is   possible to implement for the capstone project related with the thesis.

Some CS areas that piqued my interest are **Autonomous and Cyber-Physical System**,  **Human Computer Interactions**,  and **Medical Image Analysis**.

I have already thought of certain topics (currently looking for RRLs) that are yet to be approved by the professor.

* IoT-based Mental Health Monitoring System
* Machine learning for Detecting Possible Mental Disorders
* Personalized   coping mechanisms via mobile apps/website (especially helpful for   people who are experiencing suicidal ideation and have no one to run to)

I   thought of these topics after discovering how essential these   technologies can be, especially given the challenges associated with   accessing mental health services in our country. We cannot deny the fact   that there are certain individuals who, for various reasons, face   difficulties that prevents them from accessing services, or even help   from their loved ones.

He’s doing part time AA for computer science but between being part-part time and failing math classes I don’t know what to tell him. I have my degree but I’ve been out of school for a while. He’s the first college student in his immediate family and wants to do well but he’ll study two days for a math test and fail it. Does computer science have any place for someone in his place?

1293,CS To CE Degree,"Hello, I am a Junior in college and decided to switch to computer engineering. Thankfully I was a computer science major and completed the majority of the CS classes I need for computer engineering. All I need is to take an extra math class (differential eqn's) and all of the electrical engineering type classes. I am enrolled in classes as of now that are still relevant to my CE degree. I will start taking more of the CE type classes in the fall of this year. Are there any things I can do to get ahead in the electrical and hardware side of computer engineering? Also any certs or extra things to learn that may be relevant in the future. Also, I have the option to get a CS minor and math minor, I just need to take a single class in each to get the minor, should I do this or just focus on getting my BS in CE? In the future I would want to work with hardware but am torn between that path or the more software path, any reason you chose one side over the other?

 Also I worked at some contracting positions at a help desk for Textron and did some work for Koch building the software side of PCs (really just reimaging them and whatnot). I work now as a software engineering student intern but unfortunately work in VBA. Will these experiences be helpful? What are some internships that I should try to land, I mostly looked at software engineering, data analytics, and cybersec as options but feel like my options have widened a bit.

I’ve been studying CS, specifically python to create a 2d tile grid turn-based game with pixel graphics but spectacular special effects to run counter with it.

On one hand, going forward with pygame would mean I don’t have to get used to another language (GDscript). I have heard of pygame struggling with performance but would that issue come into play with the type of game I’m making? 
My main quarrel is that Godot is specific for video games, catering to the creation of them and that it would potentially be superior to PG, but i’m still so on the fence!

1341,Reaching out for help,"Hi everyone, hope you all are doing good. 

I am 21 years old and currently in the customer service job profile. I wanted to do computer science during my college but couldn't afford it. I still want to pursue it as numbers, analysing and logical thinking is something that keeps my brain engaged and is very intriguing to me. The only reason I am mentioning the text before is that I have ADHD and learnt that the fast paced environments, where my brain can be engaged throughout the day is a place where I thrive in. 

To start my journey towards CS after getting this job, I have opted to study the CS50 course and along with that learn web developement pipeline. My company has the resources mentioned on their website, so I am using that. As more time I spent on learning this and being active on social media, there are people who kept saying that web developement AND SDE or coding as a skill is gonna be completely useless in the coming time. 

I spiralled into overthinking (I can't help it) and reached out to my uncle, who is a global head HR for a big company. 
He reaffirmed the same thing. Told me coding is gonna be redundant in the future and I should look for something else like product design or something. 

I don't know anything at this point. My plan was to get into web development as a starting point and transition later on ahead by upskilling myself to either ML or DevOps or Cybersec. 

I am reaching out not just for comfort but to understand the steps that i am taking are right or wrong. I have spent a lot of my time in teenage just doing nothing or something that was completely useless. I am scared to proceed ahead without having SOME clarity of the future.

1342,Storing mathematical formulas with variables in Microsoft SQL,"Hello, I need to implement a feature that stores a user input formula.   
The formula will have variables (like nbItems, nbReports, averageFailures etc: 2\*averageFailures > (1+nbItems) bla bla)   


I was going for a simple solution of storing the formula as a string in a table, and another table with the variable names, then I could make a many-to-many relation between the tables. (I am constrained to use MySQL databases). This way I could just get the formula, all variables associated then fetch their values from an API (can't store value in DB, they change frequently) and then replace them in their respective placeholders.

Is this a bad approach to it?   


I see that people usually split these expressions with binary trees, but I do not know if it's a good solution, as some people on StackOverflow are against it:  [java - Store expression trees in database - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5026322/store-expression-trees-in-database).

Can you give me some suggestions on how to approach this or validate/invalidate my approach?

1362,Shedding some light onto internship rejections,"Hi all, I'm a second year comp sci student in the USA at a mid tier school.

I just wanted to share with you all, under the guise of a throwaway account, the (potential) true nature of why so many of those internships you apply for get no responses, or even if you get an interview, you get ghosted after.

So my dad (yes nepotism but I truly don't want to get into it right now as this is just an informational post as it doesn't seem fair to me either) is a high ranked senior software engineer (i think technically employed as a consultant for salary reasons but operates as basically an employee) at a large reputable bank, making low to mid six figures and is good friends with a good majority of the VPs that he works with as well as a few of their hiring managers.

When I wanted to get an internship this year, I applied like the rest of you to about a hundred internships, and didn't hear back a single thing from any of them, and as such asked my dad what I was doing wrong, he told me it not to worry about it and that he could try to get me a position with him.

What he then did, is went and spoke to his supervisor, who involved some of the recruiters and VPs they've known for a long time, and pushed through the CREATION of a new position for me to apply for.

This position was then publicly posted onto their website and numerous platforms so that the position would be viewed as genuine, even though the multiple thousands of people that applied for the position were never truly being considered for that position, and even the ones that were being interviewed were just so that on paper they could say that the hiring process was above board. I too was interviewed, but it was mostly just me talking with some guys that I've already known from potlucks and Christmas parties for years, talking about how life has been and general small talk.

Having just received my offer letter from the bank for my summer internship, I just wanted to share this with some of the rest of you guys, even if just to reassure you that it may not be what is on your resume that is getting you rejected from these positions, it might just be that the position never really existed to begin with.

1375,Hope this sub doesn't torch newcomers.,"Hi, I've been hunting around on reddit for a place to share computer science ideas and projects.  I've been really disappointed and left the r/programming and r/cpp subs because of terrible hostility.  Yet I am a programmer and I've done it my whole life and I love sharing code and thoughts and ideas.  I also love supporting fellow programmers' efforts.  Something I haven't found in those other subs.  For example, I posted a new encoder/decoder to r/programming.  It was downvoted 4 out of 5 votes.  It also got torched.  The people who torched it were flat wrong in just about everything they torched it.  They used encoding and encryption interchangeably. Then the mods took down the post.  Literally why?  I literally spent months on the algorithm I posted.  I was pretty damn proud of it.  r/cpp is the same.  C++ programmers on that sub can really be total assholes, seems the majority of the time.  You can gush all you want on home grown classes and classic C++ and get torched because you don't use the standard template library for the majority of shit.  They tell you to hang it up if you use raw pointers and they forget that at the bottom of the standard template library are things built around them.  I was told on r/programming that the sub was for enterprise coding which is code for JavaScript/TypeScript and the programmers there put more emphasis on formatted code over function.  Anyhow, I hope this isn't too strong of an intro but there you go.  I have 10 projects on GitHub and 12 articles on CodeProject.  Just looking for a place to share stuff.  I love compression, encryption, encoding, computational geometry, and just cool shit.  I practice the shine theory so that when we shine on each other we all get better.

1379,identifying Data Types in Real Life Scenarios,"hi!

i needed some help with a computer science course that i am currently taking.

the question involves identifying the appropriate data types to the scenerios given; for example, Representing the hierarchy of a company's management structure would involve a tree, Organizing a list of phone contacts with speed dial numbers would involve a hash table, and Sending a document to print would involve a queue.

however, the ones i am having trouble solving are as follows:

Arranging 20 chocolates bars in a box and naming it (i am thinking this is either an array or linked data)  


Storing and retrieving items in a vending machine (i am thinking this is either an array or stack)  


Displaying the relationships between characters in a novel (i am thinking that this is a graph data)  


the options are: array, linked data, hash table, graph data, tree, stack, queue

i believe that these options can be used multiple times.

help would greatly be appreciated. thank you so much in advance!

1427,"A C++ class for basic statistics with example. I considered doing operator overloading but I haven't really worked out how I want that to work. In this example numbers are added and subtracted from a sequence. After each add or remove the mean, variance, and std dev are show for operation.","This implementation is different than most implementations of calculating the basic statistics.  These are mean, variance, and standard deviation.  In this implementation, observations are added and removed at a time.  A scalar can specify how many to add or remove at once.

In the example below, the values 25, 50, and 75 are added to the sequence. Then 75 is removed and it can be shown that the calculation removes 75 and shows that the sequence is the same as if only 25 and 50 were added.  Then 100 is added.

Observations can be added with a scalar that tells how many to add or remove at once

add 25: mean=25 variance=0 stddev=0

add 50: mean=37.5 variance=312.5 stddev=17.6777

add 75: mean=50 variance=625 stddev=25

remove 75: mean=37.5 variance=312.5 stddev=17.6777

Now that I’m in higher classes I can't bring myself to do the assignments because I get bored easily, and can’t focus on any assignments because I'm not really interested in it,I barely know how to code or do anything.

Sure we have encryption and security nowadays which makes hacking anything nearly impossible if the security is implemented properly, but back in the 90s when there were so many issues and oversights with security, it's strange to me that literally altering account balances programmatically was never a thing, or was it?",1707520758,373525,JoshofTCW,t2_tetw6,94d26b7b106e2733ad6717f74f080444b8b415836400ea2e55c65568fa0f0424,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1an1pon/whats_stopped_hackers_from_altering_bank_account/

1446,"Strictly speaking, what is an object in programming?","A friend of mine and I disagree over what an object actually is in object-oriented programming. I say it's a section of memory the program allocates to not be overwritten, but my friend says it's a name like ""xPosition"" or ""stringToInt""

In object-oriented programming languages, pretty much everything is an object. Functions, integers, strings, lists, etc. are all object types. My experience with them is in Python.

If I know the basics correctly, an object is created when a line of code with a new literal is run. So whether I have a variable to catch it, writing `5` on its own will find an open spot on the memory and save the value 5 in however many bytes it needs. Garbage collection will free this memory or maybe prevent it from being saved since there is no reference to it, but the idea is there.

When I say `a = 5`, a reference 'a' is added to a variable table on the memory. When `a` is called, Python searches that variable table for a key called 'a' and if it exists, fetches the value associated with it. That table also stores the value's type, so that '5', stored as 00000101 in one byte, can be interpreted as the integer 5 as opposed to the ascii character associated with 00000101.

So in this situation, with names and variables and data, would you say the actual 'object' itself is the data stored on the memory? Or would you say it's the entry on the table of names? Or is it something else?",1707523733,373525,MomICantPauseReddit,t2_2v6vdzwz,99198ababebbc90eda46a4a4fb1e450ce6e40bad833a1f4376ba13e87ab8ce39,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1an2ssn/strictly_speaking_what_is_an_object_in_programming/

1455,Am I cooked?,"Im an ABM senior high chool student finishing my last year and im currently locked in with my college course (CS) but its not for the reason most people think

For a little context, both my parents graduated a CS degree like 25+ years ago and my dad currently owns 2 tech companies that r doing really well while my mom is managing the family business (hotels) and her own business (AirBnB). My brother whos one year older than me is currently on his 1st year in College also taking CS.

Now as for me, im not passionate at all towards CS, but im also not passionate about anything besides maybe cooking and art (?). BUTTT I do have a good academic standing and I enjoy learning new concepts and solving problems that requires a lot of critical thinking, abstract, etc.

My brother is not so much of an academic overachiever like I am but hes doing just fine (?) in CS and passed his first semester when more than 50% of his department didnt.

Now, Ive been seeing a lot of discussion lately around the Computer Science major, specifically mentioning how people who choose it for the money should just give up but the people who chose it for passion should be fine. 

Like I said, I have no passion towards it but I also have no other passion towards any other course and I genuinely cannot see myself doing medical, civil engineering, accounting, law, etc. I chose CS because it my was safe option but its not looking so safe anymore. I know its hard but I do believe i have enough resilience and grit (but I also have no idea what im getting myself into). Im worried this is something I might regret but as I look at other options, I always go back to CS. 

I feel like Im just clinging on to what Im familiar with since my entire bloodline seems to move towards the tech industry. I mean dont get me wrong I love techy shit and I love gaming and the thought of game development excites me a bit (if that helps). But as of now I have no knowledge of CS except maybe the first 2 hours of that Harvard CS50 Introduction course.

1466,Inject memory safety check into executable binaries to get rid of MMUs?,"Let's say there's a binary with content:

    void main() {/*...*/}
    int swap(int *a, int *b) {
        int tmp = &a;
        &a = &b;
        &b = tmp;
    }

If we insert some memory safety check before every pointer operation into the binary, we'll have:

    void main() {/*...*/}
    int swap(int *a, int *b) {
        validate_ptr(a);
        validate_ptr(b);
        int tmp = &a;
        &a = &b;
        &b = tmp;
    }

        }
        exit(ILLEGAL_MEM_ACCESS);
    }

It's 100% safe to execute this binary under real mode because it will never access illegal addresses.

Now, if our OS has a ""compiler"" that ""compiles"" every executable binaries into such ""safe binaries"" before executing them, we can get rid of the MMU and let everything run under the same address space. This can reduce a lot of overhead.

1471,"What are some general topics/basic facts I should know about for casual convo, to not look stupid (at university)?","Hiya

I'm studying CS this Sep at uni but it was only this past year that I discovered programming and got really interested

The problem is none of my friends were into computers so I haven't really grown to have those kinds of conversations and learn about computers naturally

So I'm learning a little about programming, artificial neural networks, maths - stuff that's interesting and can be learnt through lectures

But the really basic stuff that ""computer nerds"" would EXPECT someone to know (even if they're not interested in CS), I'm worried that I don't know any of it and I'll sound like an idiot or a faker (if that makes sense) during the course

Any tips, please, on what topics/stuff to have a look at?

1486,"Looking for a SWE career in the future, but not sure what classes to take in my undergrad"," I'm currently a freshman in college and I am dead set on a SWE career postgrad. However, there are two lower division series for programming, and I'm not sure which I should take.

One of the series (CS 30 series at UCLA) is the typical series offered by the CS department that all the CS majors are required to take -- it's very rigorous and is specifically designed to weed as many people out as possible. I'm currently taking the first class of this series for this quarter, and the first thing I noticed was that these classes are definitely designed to heavily filter people out. I must admit that I am struggling in this class because I have no prior coding experience, the pace has picked up quite a bit, and half of our current project requires us to use functions that haven't even been covered in lectures yet.

Because of this, I was considering whether or not I should just finish up this class for the quarter, drop the series next quarter, and then pick up the other series (PIC 10 series at UCLA). This series covers the same programming language (C++) just like the other series, however, from what I know, it is more slow paced and less rigorous. I don't really know what the detailed differences are, and I don't know if this would significantly hinder my chances of becoming a SWE. It's a C++ programming series that is offered by the math department, not the CS department.

I've done some research on both series, but I unfortunately was unable to come to a concrete conclusion.

1519,Tell me why Mac computers are better for people with disabilities,"Hi. I am doing a project (not for school) and I want to compile a report about why Mac OS is a better software for people with disabilities. I would like to have concrete answers not just “because it is”. I have also read articles online but I would love to hear individual opinions. (I also have disabilities myself). I also understand that every disability is a little different. 

For example, I believe that Mac is a superior software because it has a much more user friendly interface than windows. Windows programs in my experience also freeze and crash a lot. I have also gotten viruses on windows computers but never on a Mac. With that being said, I actually own both a windows and a Mac computer because some programs I like to use on windows are not compatible with Mac and Vice versa.

What bothers me most is the fact I’ve never done any big projects in any domain. I’ve never mastered anything really, never made any significant progress in any one area.

I feel the need for 3 distinct terms for:

* the property
* the value of the property: 'value' seems the correct term
* the property-value pair

To me it is equally valid to say 'the color of a car is a property' (the term property includes the color value) or 'color is a property of a car' (value not included).

Of course I could use the term 'property-value pair' but it is a bit heavy if used frequently in a text.

Maybe the term for the 'property-value pair' is a 'characteristic'?

1554,What is the faster algorithm to calculate the local entropy of an image and which one does scikit-image entropy filter use?,"Hello, I wanted to find a way to calculate a local entropy of an image and have been researching about it. Almost everywhere I found the same method to go through each pixel and find the probability of that pixel in its neighborhood by going through each pixel in its neighborhood as shown here.
https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/~maucher/Python/MMCodecs/html/basicFunctions.html

I found scipy-entropy filter and it is quite fast. I know it uses cython underneath but it was still way faster than my pure C implementation of the method I said earlier. 
I looked into its source code and it also seems to go through each pixel, make a histogram of block, find probability from higher level but it has too many tiny things which I think are making it faster. 
Can anyone please explain me what scikit-image is doing. If it's using any known algorithm, can you please tell what is it? I need to know this. Please

1575,Criticism of How Computer Science is Taught,"Throughout my computer science undergrad, I am disappointed by other students lack of interest and curiosity. Like how most show up to work with only a paycheck in mind, most students only ask, ""Will this be on the test?"" and are only concerned with deliverables. Doing only the bare minimum to scrape by and get to the next step, ""only one more class until I graduate"". Then the information is brain dumped and forgotten about entirely. If one only sees the immediate transient objective in front of them at any given time, they will live and die without ever asking the question of why. Why study computer science or any field for that matter? There is lack of intrinsic motivation and enjoyment in the pursuit of learning.

University has taken the role of trade schools in recent history, mainly serving to make young people employable. This conflicts with the original intent of producing research and expanding human knowledge. The chair of computer science at my university transitioned from teaching the C programming language to Python and Javascript as these are the two industry adopted languages despite C closer to the hardware, allowing students to learn the underlying memory and way code is executed. Python is a direct wrapper of C and hides many intricate details, from an academic perspective, this is harmful.

1587,Is being an employee ok in the current job market?,"Hello everyone,

I saw this video from a developer who talks about the employee mindset and how it is going to get harder for developers now that we are in a high interest market and that working in tech is more of a ""means to an end"" instead of a career. He goes on to say that programmers should quickly try to start their own businesses and try to not be employees.

This has made me pretty depressed since I am going back for a CS degree currently as a community college/working while I am in my late 20's and feel as though I am late to the game and running out of time and cannot focus on side projects etc.

I just hope to get a job so I can better my situation but there seems to be a lot of people saying you need to either start your own business or that coding is dead altogether (as stated by techlead the youtuber).

Be interesting to hear other perspectives.

1588,First year CS student - How can I learn more about computational complexity?,"Hi,

I'm currently a second semester CS student currently taking discrete structures. I'm loving it so far! I've had an interest in computation complexity for a while now - can this problem be solved in a certain amount of time? How many resources would it take? Can computers even solve certain problems? It was learning about the P=NP problem that got me interested. Is there a book or something where I can at least learn the basics? Do I need to wait until I've taken discrete + data structures + algorithms? Thanks a bunch!

1589,Feeling completely helpless,"I was a criminal justice major but I always wanted to do cybersecurity so I switched majors two years in. My first class I did great I had 112 for half the semester. For context this was just an intro class and it wasn’t required. The next semester I took the first required class and failed twice and passed the third time. I’m in the next class and I already failed once and now I’m feeling so helpless again. I go to tutoring and instead of helping I get quizzed and told “I’m not gonna do everything for you”. I don’t want everything done for me I’m in here because I need help! But if I know little to nothing how am i supposed to know? I ask my friends and they call me stupid even though two of them also failed the same class I’m currently repeating. For a little bit of backstory, my professor said 2/3rds of the class will fail the first class. So I guess I’m not alone? But my professors don’t teach, they have PowerPoints and lectures but I HAVE to see it played out in programming. This was done my first class which is why I did so well, but now it’s just talking about functions instead of showing me them actually plugged in. Now I’m using Linux and I can write a program that does what it’s supposed to but it doesn’t pass the GitHub test so I fail. My professor said he doesn’t do office hours, my tutor doesn’t help, and I have no other resources near me cause I go to a southern school. The professors admit most people fail the first few classes. What do I do? Also I have gone to the dean but the dean is also the professor who teaches the first class so not much help there.

I’m entering my 3rd year in my program (fully online) I’ve taken two Java classes and am in a computer systems class learning about binary, hexadecimal etc. where all of my assignments are in Java. 
First, I understand that Java is fundamental to cs and it has been good at teaching conceptual ideas and the basics of cs. However, I have an extremely hard time writing code for my assignments. My program seems to like to teach concepts and then in my assignments it asks me to implement those concepts into code. However, I do not feel as though it is a good way for my brain to learn. For example if I had a job where I had to learn how to use a new software or do a specific task in a software I wasn’t familiar with the best way I learn to use/do the task is to be shown how to do it once or twice then I take it in better and am able to replicate it and learn how the implementation works, which sticks in my brain better. Basically if I’m shown the answer, then shown how to get to the answer I am able to grasp how and why the process is important and works and from there I am able to see where improvements could happen, or how things could be done differently. Basically my question is, is being a good problem solver, and having a good math brain enough to be a good computer scientist? Or is being able to code from scratch from concepts imperative to cs?",1707927613,374460,squintsforlife,t2_4j0v703d,fe9794b73a34dfc32ed8fa2d82916a08b54e326e2d356710c2af8a2bdbbc7d61,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1aqqshb/cs_student_feeling_overwhelmed/

1625,First year struggling with maths," Hi!

I'm currently in my first year as a computer science student; It's going quite well in everything except maths. First math we had was ""Discrete mathematics"" and although it was a lot harder than any math I've studied I still got through it quite nicely.

Now, however, we started with ""calculus and analysis"" or ""one variable analysis"" and it's hell. We have those sin, cos, e, ln and so on; and although they aren't really that complex I can't manage to solve problems evolving them. I don't have enough experience from high school because I just studied to get a good grade and I was kind of smart so I just studied a day or 2 before the exam, got a good grade and completely wiped my memory of whatever I learned.

I was wondering if there's a fast solution to learn those operations like:

ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b)

What do I search on youtube for example? I'm completely lost and the stress is making me not study so it's piling up.

We started limits and those were kinda easy; but when we started derivatives and ""integrals"" I feel like if they speak a different language in the lecture I would understand the same (almost not at all).

I'm curious as to what I should do, just study harder? Is there a smarter way to do it? I'm extremely lazy and usually can't study math for more than max 3 hours a day.

Thanks a lot!! <3 <3",1707990399,374571,Rodolf_cs,t2_kt4izihi8,6851dbc9f7638f8c43601eb9c11b76a860de047a575e09a63d86cdcabaf3702b,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1arbx9l/first_year_struggling_with_maths/

For example's sake, let's say you're learning to play guitar. You might learn that the guitar is an instrument that is made out of wood, with a body and neck, and has 6 strings. You can strum or pluck the strings to produce melody and harmony. Now you can dig deeper and ask what wood is, and technically you can continue until learning about the molecular structure of wood, which isn't really pertinent to playing the guitar.

1644,"Your opinion on Feynman saying computer Science is more engineering, than science?","

""Computer science also differs from physics in that it is not actually a science. It does not study natural objects. Neither is it, as you might think, mathematics; although it does use mathematical reasoning pretty extensively. Rather, computer science is like engineering - it is all about getting something to do something""-- Richard Feynman as quoted in the Theory of computation.  


I think everything is considered a science these days including computer science, and that has done more disservice to the field of computation. This kind of idea keeps us at an abstract layer such as time complexities and data Structures.

This takes us away from the roots of computation which is a physical phenomenon that drives its power from physics (logic gates and now q bits with quantum computers ) and is more limited by physical materials' ability to do computation. Do you think there is a disservice people are doing when they call computer science a science and get stuck in a local maximum when it comes to improving computation through other sciences and math?

This is probably quite the stupid question , however, for a small university assignment I want to do a regression analysis of some shipping data but there's quite a lot of it (2009 to 2023, with each day it's own file almost a gigabyte in size). It's entirely infeasible given the storage /computing power of my laptop and the download speed of my internet to use all of this. So I decided that I'd like to choose just 4 dates from each year but how do I go about picking those dates? Will I introduce bias if I just choose the first of every 3rd month? Is there a way I can choose these dates randomly or is that also not a good ideas as it might then be heavily swayed to the summer months one year and to the winter another (seasons I'm sure affect the degree of marine traffic).",1708079956,374316,Jessiedoodledo,t2_txro0ycp,e8a72e19e529ab69738ce2eb40fbe3a703303eec78c5dda0a565b26d9faee36d,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1as5ldb/choosing_dates_for_regression_analysis_help/

1701,Sacrificing social life for internship,"TL:DR Is a sophomore more engineering internship worth sacrificing my social like for this semester of college.
I am a current computer Science student at a top 50 state school. I only recently switched into computer science and spent my last semester partying with no real work put in (other than codeacademy). I have recently started developing my skills and working on projects, with the realization that I would need to sacrifice a lot of time with my social life to have a decent chance at good internships sophomore year. I know internships are super competitive atm and my goal is to work in FAANG or big tech (scroll down to see why). I believe a good internship sophomore year will give me a great jumpstart for future internships and a bigtech/FAANG job out of college. Also I’ll have less stress and a need to work on projects in my later years of college (of course I still will work on them). However, I know I would sacrifice a large part of my social life and almost never go out to complete this (night time is the only time I have to work on projects). I am wondering if anyone has been in similar situations or knows the value of a high quality sophomore year internship. 

Why I want to work in FAANG/Big Tech: I know people will give opinion about not needing to work in FAANG/Big tech for a good career which I completely agree with. But I also know myself and I know I would do better in the large scale and competitive environment that these companies offer. High Pressure/competitive will keep the job from getting stale and give me constant motivation to work so I believe I’ll do best there. That is my opinion from my research into these companies",1708170198,374220,SidTheScenceKid,t2_8m0kmh4m,f20465c8299b5c16b0e653e8c5f182135524d81b52d202afb2b5968dedcea56f,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1at03hw/sacrificing_social_life_for_internship/

My orientation lecture for BCOMP is tomorrow at nine in the morning (02:57 where I am right now), and last year, I did Advanced Mathematics, and received a Band 1. Not only that, but I probably would have received a Band 1 if I did standard, too.

The only reason I got into uni, is because I applied via early entry to the most local, rural uni you've probably ever seen. Except, to be honest, you've probably never seen it or heard about it regardless. They gave me an unconditional, simply because they have no sense of conditional offers. My ATAR was... Disappointingly low, to say the least. I even had an N-Award.

When I saw the ""expected knowledge"" was Maths ext. 1, I genuinely had a panic attack.

I know how to use a calculator, and without one, I could possibly do basic addition, but even that's pushing it. [/hj]

I'm making a thesis on handgun detection using YOLOv7 and my prof suggested that I also need to classify the pose of the person (whether it is ready-to-fire / low-ready / holstered). The thing is I know how to work on the detection of the handgun only but i dont know how or what kind of a model can classify the stance/pose by detecting the handgun and calculating the angle or distance to the head of the person. I couldn't find any guide/source code for a model.

I'm currently thinking about using roboflow for annotating my datasets then use Openpose program for pose detection and Yolov7 for object detection but I dont know if it'll work if I combine the two detection models.

If anyone can guide me or at least send me a reference for a source code I'll be forever be grateful and I'll finally be able to graduate.

1727,Basic Introduction to Java analogy,"Explanation of what basic concepts of Java are:

1. **Toy Factory (Class):**
   - Imagine a big toy factory where we decide how our toys will look and what they can do. This is like a class in Java. We design the blueprint for our toys here.

2. **Blueprint (Class Definition):**
   - The blueprint is like the plan for how a toy should be made. It includes what color it will be, what it can do, and other details. In Java, this is called the class definition.

3. **Toy (Object):**
   - Each actual toy we make from the blueprint is an object. If we have a blueprint for a teddy bear, each teddy bear we make is a separate toy (object) with its own special characteristics.

4. **Pocket (Instance Variable):**
   - Think of a pocket on a toy where we can keep something special, like a note or a small treasure. In Java, this is like an instance variable – a place inside each toy (object) where it can store its unique information.

5. **Note (Parameter):**
   - When we want our toy to have something specific in its pocket, we give it a note. This note is like a parameter in Java. It's the information we pass to the toy's special step (method) to tell it what to do.

6. **Building (Constructor):**
   - When we're putting together a new toy, there's a special step where we set it up and prepare it for playtime. In Java, this is the constructor – it's like the special process that happens when we create a new toy.

7. **Playtime Activity (Method):**
   - Toys can do fun things! Playing music, dancing, or even changing colors. In Java, these fun things are like methods – they are actions the toy can perform. If a toy can sing, then ""sing"" is one of its methods.

8. **Toy's Message (Return Statement):**
   - Sometimes a toy can tell us something special. Imagine a toy saying, ""I'm happy!"" In Java, this is like a return statement – the toy is giving us back a message when we ask it to do something.",1708225802,374395,throwaway_8oo8,t2_e32yj8rhd,ab309c8b573bc6f18a644db997baf9c43c3850aaa08f03a8d78d13e63cd8082a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1atk4ht/basic_introduction_to_java_analogy/

1738,Seeking Advice: Final Year Computer Science Project Options,"Hello everyone,

I need some help choosing the subject of my final year computer science project. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and insights on which option might be more feasible.

After spending about a week narrowing down ideas, I've come up with two potential subjects:

&#x200B;

**Choice A: Game Development**

I'm contemplating developing a Proof of Concept for either a 3D Action Roleplaying Game using Unreal Engine 5 or a 2D platformer using Unity. While this endeavor is quite ambitious, game development is a true passion of mine. My plan is to keep the project relatively simple, focusing on core elements like character mobility, zone instancing, and basic combat mechanics (hitting, blocking, dodging). Additionally, I intend to incorporate a talent system with 5-7 talents. Due to time constraints, I won't be able to add many additional features beyond these. For assets such as character models, artwork, animations, and sound, I'll be utilizing freely available resources to minimize time spent on asset creation. My main focus will be on programming and bringing all components together. I understand that substantial research and effort will be necessary for this project.

&#x200B;

**Choice B: AI Chatbot Development**

Alternatively, I have been considering developing an AI chatbot. This chatbot would be designed to check product availability for customers and provide relevant information stored in a database to authorized users. Among other customer service-related features.

&#x200B;

I'm torn between these two options and would appreciate any insights or advice you may have.

1746,I build my first parser! Feedback welcome!,"Hey everyone! I recently completed a university assignment where I built a parser to validate code syntax.  Since it's all done, I'm not looking for assignment help, but I'm super curious about other techniques and approaches people would use. I'd also love some feedback on my code if anyone's interested.

This was the task in a few words:

* **Task:** Build a parser that checks code against a provided grammar.
* **Constraints:** No external tools for directly interpreting the CFG.
* **Output:** Simple ""Acceptable"" or ""Not Acceptable"" (Boolean) based on syntax.
* **Own Personal Challenge:** Tried adding basic error reporting.

Some of those specifications looked like this :

* (if **COND** B1 B2) where **COND** is a condition (previously shown in the document) and B1/B2 are blocks of code (or just one line).

1751,Good way to store files that change frequently on the backend.,"I am making an application that deals with files. The client initially uploads the file to the server. From then on, any changes made to the file are sent to the server as deltas.

The server uses these deltas and changes the file to reflect the changes made by the client. 

I am right now just storing the user files in a local directory on the server. This obviously will not scale well. There arises another issue with this approach. I want to offload the task of updating the file to another process on another server. Since this process is on another server, it doesn't have access to the files in the local directory of the web server. 

I want to know what's a good way to store files that may change frequently. ",1708339352,374657,spaceuserm,t2_46jiy2sp,897a700eddc1987c1c44b001eee904f0731d2883b777e62675713846eb12508d,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1aukfgh/good_way_to_store_files_that_change_frequently_on/

I cheated on an assignment. I am happy I can use this opportunity to learn. From now on, I want to go about life as authentically as I can. The reason I cheated was because it was the only way I could stay afloat in this class. For some reason, they let me in the course even though I received a C- in the prerequisite course, and I'm technically not supposed to be in this class because of that grade. I have been struggling mentally for years due to some other issues I have, and entering college without having healed yet exacerbated my problems. On top of that, the pressure of university and how it forces you to grow up NOW, just makes everything so much harder. I am afraid I can't handle this, but I have to, right? Even before this event, I have always felt like a burden to my parents. They are ~60 years old and still working. I go to an expensive uni and I was awarded a significant amount of financial aid, and I fear that with this probation matter, I'll have the aid swiped away. I don't really know why I am posting this. I just feel hopeless and continuing feels hard. I only added computer science to my major to make more money in the future and help my parents out. Now look at where my own mistakes have landed me. I guess I am looking for some consolation that life isn't over and I still might be successful in the future? This all feels really painful. I know I made a mistake and I wish the punishment were less official and less permanent. Am I stupid? Yes I am. Pain!

1780,Question about backing up data on the long run," Hi,

(I'm sorry to post this question here but on r/computers nobody really answered my question)

There is something that bothers me:

Let's  say I have a laptop with a ssd. And I often do backups of this ssd on  an external drive. This way, my data is safe. And even if the  computer  dies then I have all my data on my external drive.

But  my problem is: if the ssd of the computer due to aging starts to have  more and more corrupted data and I am not aware of it, I will erase the  previous backups with a new corrupted backup.

How  is it possible to prevent that?  Is it possible to know when a ssd  starts to have corrupted data (so I don't do backups with this ssd, buy a  new ssd and copy the last backup to the new ssd)?

1783,Inverting matrix A*A mysteriously helps speed up computation of eigenvalues?,"[Originally posted here: https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/43867/]

I have written the following code in MATLAB. I also observe the same effect in Arnoldi iteration in ARPACK in C.
```matlab
N = 4000;
A = rand(N); % Random entries in Uniform[0,1]
tic
AstarA = A.' * A + 5*eye(N);
toc
AstarAinv = inv(AstarA); % Inverse
tic
eigs(AstarA, 1, ""smallestreal"") % Eigenvalue with smallest real part
toc
tic
eigs(AstarAinv, 1, ""largestreal"") 
toc
tic 
svds(A, 1, ""smallest"");
toc

```
Observations:

 1. `eigs(AstarA, 1, ""smallestreal"")` takes about 16s.
 2. `eigs(AstarA, 1, ""largestreal"")` takes about 8s.
 3. `svds(A, 1, ""smallest"")` takes 6s.

I am perplexed by the result. I do not know what is going on in svds sooooo slow, but for the first two observations, I have implemented Arnoldi iteration in ARPACK in C. I see the same effect - the algorithm converges faster with the inverted matrix.

I could not understand this - if many eigenvalues are very close to zero then surely inverting can help pull clustered eigenvalues apart and speed up convergence. But the smallest eigenvalue of `AstarA` is about 5, which is far from zero. **So why inverting the matrix still helps?**

**The same effect persists when I change** `real` to `abs`. **You cannot simply say it is because it is easier to work with largest absolute values than smallest values** - ""smallestreal"" and ""largestreal"" are fully symmetric concepts.

[Also, although it might not be possible to answer, why is svds faster? Isn't it also using Arnoldi iteration?]",1708433350,374819,spherical_shell,t2_nw8uzkwp,1e73f4d3c8ee20d3dbf61ce15f3bf99109ccce361395d7cf1d9a600d5d84626a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1avgv8b/inverting_matrix_aa_mysteriously_helps_speed_up/

1798,Why is there no U2F alternative for authorizing transactions?,"As far as I understand, U2F key generates a public/private key pair that it then uses to sign a bit string coming from the portal we want to authenticate to. That portal then uses public key to validate that we are we by checking signature.

This is obviously great for increased security authentication, but cannot be used for authorization of transactions, as there is no way for end user to verify the exact scope of the transaction itself (for example which bank account we are sending money to).

The question I have is: why cant we just create a U2F token with a display, that would sign not only the nonce, but also the message that service provider is sending, and that would be displayed on the screen before authorizing (for example scanning finger on a key). As a result, it would not be possible to use the signature to authorize any operation, other than the one described in the message.

Above seems like a natural extension of u2f protocol. It does not seem to be worked on yet, from which I assume that there is some flaw in my reasoning above.

I'm looking to submit a new dag feature/algorithm to networkx, that I am calling ""pure descendants"". The maintainers have asked me to provide an existing name and literature for this concept, but so far, I am unable to find any. Was hoping that someone here could help point me in the right direction, or could point me somewhere else that I could ask.

The concept of what I am calling pure descendants goes like this. Pure descendants of a set of nodes R, are all nodes downstream of R that are *entirely* derived either directly or indirectly from R. Pure descendants of R is invalid if any of the nodes in R is a pure descendant of any combination of other nodes within R (or put another way, pure_descendants(R) cannot contain any of the nodes in R).

Since the release of gtp4 voice I've been asking each day for it to tell me about one random topic in computer science or software engineering.

1824,Time management: How to stop working late but still get things done,"So I'm in this habit of just staring at the monitor for hours without really moving or taking care of myself 

I do it even when I'm not really focused or going down a wrong rabbit hole, just keep staring at code / randomly scrolling through tutorials / StackOverflow without feeling like I'm making concrete progress.  I know I have ADHD and a lot of it comes from having worked at my startup basically alone for years



I'm sure sleep, diet, socialization, and exercise play a part, but I just feel like I should be working again and stop taking care of myself.  When I work all day (I stayed til 7 last night) I don't sleep as well and it starts to affect the rest of my life in a feedback loop 

I know my coworkers get more done than I do, and it is concerning because our performance revies are coming up in a few months and I don't want to get PIPed.  Maybe I should literally just ask them about their work process.  I am a little concerned that would give me a bad reputation on the team, though 

But I guess I already have kind of a bad reputation because I'm always late and asking questions that could probably honestly be answered by looking at documentation and/or testing things by myself 

This feels disorganized but yeah if y'all have any tips, that'd be awesome!  I've been doing some positive self-talk and meditations and keeping track of my sleep times on a Google Sheets (basically Microsoft Excel)

Any concrete action suggestions would be great; unfortunately ""be smarter and more focused"" is not easily actionable short-term advice.  I'm sure that will come again as I build better habits as it has in the past


I just feel like if I actually work 7 days a week, ≥4 serious coding hours a day, I'll lose even more balance and have serious emotional problems that will.  Bill Gates did it, but I don't think I could, even though I'm also pretty sharp (or at least I used to be in high school and most of college, lost some momentum over the years and focus has just gotten much worse)

1830,Simple javascript code that could help soldiers and civilians detect and evade both drone strikes and enemy invaders (prepared for immediate deployment),"&#x200B;

Two javascript projects that make use of object detection. One uses a simple code that could help detect enemy drones. The other uses a simple code that could help detect enemy soldiers. Both apps could be deployed immediately

[https://www.academia.edu/115181929/Aerial\_Object\_Detection\_updated\_for\_combat\_deployment\_](https://www.academia.edu/115181929/Aerial_Object_Detection_updated_for_combat_deployment_)

*Wait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam - at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an aerial object is located. The longer an aerial object is hovering near you, the longer the beeping noise. For soldiers, this could mean that a drone is targeting them. Ideally, soldiers would use the app on their cell phones and attach the device to the top area of their vehicles or to their body while sleeping in the trenches. Keep mind that sim cards must be removed and cell phone wireless connectivity must remain ""off"" in combat environments. Before deployment, soldiers should connect to wifi and start the app. Once the app is started, a soldier can then disable wifi and leave the app running as he/she is deployed into a combat zone. For detecting aerial objects in combat, android phone should be mounted to the top of the backpack or top of the helmet. In civilian environments, the cell phone, with wireless turned on, could be placed on rooftops. With internet access, a user could view the aerial scene remotely with facebook live*

*Wait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam-at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an intruder is detected. The app will also emit voice alert, saying ""intruder detected"" upon detection of an intruder. This app allows phones to be mounted in various places, to which it can detect when an intruder is in the area. This can be used in clearing and counter insurgency operations. This is also useful for the civilian population against thugs and other criminal elements in urban environments. The app can prevent ambush attacks. The phone could be placed in the cracks of walls and other discreet locations. With internet access, a user could view the scene remotely with facebook live and see when intruders have gained unauthorized access.*",1708539981,375035,AnthonyofBoston,t2_fesy5456p,336828275f3e57e780cc359e6770d22cfba89d26aa93d56dd89f4a79470b95cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1awjbvq/simple_javascript_code_that_could_help_soldiers/

1842,Should We Still Contribute to Open Source if Our Contributions are Scraped for AI Models?,"With the recent advances in AI and my use of it personally in my job alongside many companies using it to reduce the number of juniors they want to hire I don't think that it's reasonable to contribute to open source as it will hasten how quickly even senior level software developers are replaced by AI. I understand the thoughts that it can't do what programmers do with respect to design or novelty but more and more I am coming to question that idea as I've built fairly novel applications in programming languages that I'm entirely unfamiliar with which are robust and performant using AI code. These were a few Go servers and command line tools for those wondering, so this might be a testament to the language rather than the AI but before starting I was entirely unfamiliar with the language and now for my job I have some highly performant safe work in it. Some worthwhile context is that I'm a senior dev with a background in Rust, C, and C++ so this was likely easier for me to do than most, but it's hard to avoid the thought that with AI I did easily what would normally have been someone else's full time job. I think many of the faults of AI will be ironed out as novel approaches to LLMs are found and at the bedrock of that is open source being used as training material.   


Am I incorrect in my assessment that contributions to AI using our skills will only devalue them and hasten our replacement and if so where or why? I understand that there's an argument to do it out of fun or to solve known glitches and errors in open source frameworks that you're using, but my drive quickly diminishes when I know contributions will reduce my future earnings. I could be overreacting obviously, but the more time goes on the more I don't think that's the case and I would like to hear others opinions on this matter to see if there's something I'm missing that would justify continuing to contribute to open source.",1708575271,375086,Dear_Situation856,t2_71757xo9,0f77750a15c9c139128928328537c706378721bfe514f4033e93a4c05accec6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1awx6ey/should_we_still_contribute_to_open_source_if_our/

1857,Novel Recursive Data Compression Algorithm," Dear Redditors,

I'm reaching out to this community to gather feedback on a recent paper I've authored concerning a novel Recursive Data Compression algorithm. My proposal challenges conventional boundaries and tackles concepts traditionally viewed as intractable within the field.

As you dive into the paper, I invite you to temporarily suspend the usual reservations surrounding the Pigeonhole Principle, Kolmogorov Complexity, and entropy — these subjects are thoroughly explored within the manuscript.

I'm specifically interested in your thoughts regarding:

* The feasibility of surpassing established compression limits in a practical sense.
* The theoretical underpinnings of recursive patterns in data that seem random.
* The potential implications this method might have on data storage and transmission efficiency.

I welcome all forms of critique, whether supportive, skeptical, or otherwise, hoping for a diverse range of insights that only a platform like Reddit can provide.

Thank you for your time and expertise, and I eagerly await your valuable perspectives.",1708609629,375143,archiegillis,t2_46j48a,ed417be3b5225d2eb5e3ef60cccba29fa456e8bebbe126b0c8e3d5ad01921ebf,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ax6s5v/novel_recursive_data_compression_algorithm/

1879,"Is there a CS50-like course/learning environment, but for Computer Systems?"," Hi!

A couple of months ago, I finished Harvard's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) and I loved it so much that I completed it in just a couple of weeks. I loved the lectures, but most of all, I think, I enjoyed the gradebook-system in which I could track my progress and I suppose that was the thing that motivated me the most to keep going.

After finishing the course, I went through most chapters in ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" and I started to build my own [6502-based computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH&pp=iAQB) in order get some hands-on experience, and I'm enjoying it so far.

I'm a trained journalist, but computers have always been my true love that I have neglected for too long so know I'm learning stuff in order to one day, hopefully, become a System/Network Administrator. I started reading ""Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"" and watching the [lectures here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CpHpFu_KYM&list=PLyboo2CCDSWnhzzzzDQ3OBPrRiIjl-aIE). However, even though I'm really interested in the topic, I've been 10 times slower than when I was doing CS50. I guess I blame it on the lack of interactivity or whatever CS50 had.

I was wondering: Is there a similar online course for Computer Systems? One where you 'enrol' and your assignments get graded, and you can track your progress?

1918,Struggling to proceed further in computer science and programming,"Hi guys, I think it's gonna be a long one, I don't know if it's a right place for that thread, but I need to get this out of my chest somewhere.

For the last couple of years I've been trying to get into computer science and programming, but I feel like I'm just too dumb for this. I've started back in 2022 by getting into the data analytics on my own; I've enrolled for some courses, started to create some simple portoflio based around SQL and after a year I've been able to land a job as a web analyst in some UX agency. I'm here for almost a year now, the job is pretty solid and I've got some opportunities to proceed further within the analytics sector, but it's not really what I'd like to do for the rest of my life. I'd like to go deeper, into data engineering or back-end development:  
1) Because it simply ""turns me on"", the topics related to these fields are fantastic and fascinating for me, I'd really love to develop complex data infrastructure, mess around with ETL etc.  
2) I just feel like the basic analytics sector is not sustainable in the current state of our job market. It really does keep me awake at night that there might be a day, in 3-5 years, when my job becomes totally unecessary because of LLM's and the rapid development of AI. That's why I sort of feel the urge to rebrand myself once again

I'll be 25 in May, I've got a bachelor's degree in totally unrelated field, last October I've started computer science & econometrics, but had to drop out after a few months because of tight schedule (even for weekend, part-time studies, the amount of hours was overwhelming). I've been trying to learn Python, starting over a year ago, but the high level of abstraction also overwhelmed me and after all these months, I still can't develop anything on my own, I even struggle with simple list comprehensions, algorithms etc. Then I've switched to C because I've started CS50 and it was great, but after getting through the basics I came back to Python because I wouldn't use any C or C++ in my development roadmap.

As I've said before - I'm struggling with the basic concepts, because for my whole education I've been a humanist, I've always sucked at maths and didn't like it, because I wanted to do stuff totally unrelated to CS, maths and general science when I was younger. Now, when I try to solve anything, I struggle a lot because of lack of general logic and problem solving knowledge that math basically teaches you for your whole life. 

Now I'm in some kind of crossroads - I genuinely think that I'm too stupid for computer science and I don't know if I should keep trying or just let it go and stick to my job, and rebrand for something else when the market for it collapses. 

Do you have any tips for a total beginner, how I could get over that hump and kick off my roadmap towards data/software engineering while being a total newbie to scientific stuff?

1929,"Algorithm for removing rows with ""NULL"" in a CSV formatted string","I have implemented 2 solutions for the problem below. In my analysis, the first solution time complexity is `O(N)` and the second solution is `O(N * max(M))` where N is the length of string S, max(M) is the maximum length of the string in each ""row"". **But trying to benchmark them using %%timeit in Jupyter Notebook shows the second solution is way faster.** Please help me point out where I'm wrong.

## Problem:

You are given a table containing data. The first row contains the column headers; all the other rows contain the data. Some of the rows are defective. A row is defective if it contains at least one cell with a NULL value written in it. You are supposed to delete all of the defective rows. You cannot change the order of rows. The number of rows and columns may differ in different test cases. The case of the letters matters ('a' ≠ 'A'). The table is given in CSV (comma-separated values) format. Every two consecutive cells in each row are separated by a single comma ',' symbol. Every two consecutive rows are separated by a new-line '\\n' symbol. For example, the first table from the task statement, written in CSV format, is the single string: `""id,name,age,score\n1,Jack,NULL,12\n17,Betty,28,11""`. You may assume that each row has the same number of cells.

## Example

Given S = `""id,name,age,score\n1,Jack,NULL,12\n17,Betty,28,11""`, your function should return `""id,name,age,score\n17,Betty,28,11""`

## Requirement

* N is an integer within the range \[1...200,000\]
* S is a string of length N of CSV format;
* There is at least one row;
* Each row has the same, positive number of cells;
* Each cell consists only of letters and/or digits;
* the first row does not contain a NULL cell.

# Solutions

**Solution 1:**

    def solution(S):
        # Implement your solution here
        S += '\n'
        result = ''
        a = b = c = 0
    
        # Increase pointer to after header part.
        while S[b] != '\n':
            b += 1
        b += 1
        result = S[0:b] 
        a = b
        c = b
    
        write = True
        while b < len(S):
            if S[b] == '\n':
                if S[a:b] != 'NULL' and write:
                    result += S[c:b+1] # include \n
                c = b + 1
                a = b + 1

1934,Please guide me on what should I proceed with,"I'm a CS student in the final years.  
I just know basic C, Python, Shell, Java, MySQL, Lex (Flex), YACC (Bison). And I'm really confused with what should I focus on, like Web development, App dev (like Android studio), CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst, .....  


Please take time to read and guide me accordingly. I'm just scared for what's to come.  


So, the thing is, I have only seen what Android app development and Web development (HTML, CSS, Python, Django) looks like.  I have no clue what the others look like or the kind of coding/skills I need to learn/develop for it. I'm really stuck and been googling stuff with no positive results.

&#x200B;

1.**Web development:**

As far as I know, I'm finding the front end (HTML, CSS) to very be dull. Do devs really learn them and code it line by line with 'divs' and all    OR    use UI making/designing tools to make the front end quicker ? And yes, the backend requires manual coding.

This is what comes to my mind about Web development as a whole.

Front end, CSS - [https://ibb.co/J2xm5Cv](https://ibb.co/J2xm5Cv)

Front end, HTML - [https://ibb.co/sHkm3yR](https://ibb.co/sHkm3yR)

Backend - [manage.py](https://manage.py), [urls.py](https://urls.py), [view.py](https://view.py), [models.py](https://models.py)

&#x200B;

**2.App dev (like Android studio):**

Also, here what I know is, its similar to Web Development. We have backend with Kotlin/Java (like Python/Django in Web).... Then we have front end XML (like HTML in Web). So somewhat similar, but I'm expecting the backend to be broader here with more complex stuff.

This is what comes to my mind about Android/App development as a whole.

Front end - All those XMLs, RAW files, Drawables etc.

Back end - [https://ibb.co/s25yfCR](https://ibb.co/s25yfCR) , all those Java, Kotlin files.

&#x200B;

**3.CyberSecurity, ML, Networking, Data Analyst and other fields:**

Zero clues. Doesn't know anything about what languages are used, what the coding looks like (compared to the above pics), the tools, code structure. The internet tells me that I need lots of patience and have to develop lots of knowledge which is really time consuming and would take years to catch up with the others and get a job. I don't even know if math skills are required here (which the above ones doesn't require as far as I know). Please provide me with the relevant info. And set of codes from files, the structure etc...

I saw this from one of the reddits *""I'm a cs engineer and I've been working as a data scientist for almost 3 years now. Currently, my job is around 60% of creating ppts, interacting with business stakeholders, meetings , 20% of creating power BI dashboards, and 20% of working with python and sql to analyze data or (rarely) build ml models."".* Don't know how complete this is about a Data Scientist. And not sure if you guys actually get what I'm looking for. Please bear with me for this.

&#x200B;

I find the Backend to be my thing with the 1st two. But really would like to know if anything else exists that's even better for me. I also enjoy making simple C programs on my own that solves problems based on the concept in my mind, like for eg: finding FIRST, FOLLOW, searching, sorting, etc...

To conclude, I would like to say I really have no info about it and doesn't know which one to pick. And if anyone manages to help, please tell from where I should be self learning about these?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

1939,Can technically the whole web being decentralized (datacenters) ?,"I explain :

The point is the datacenters are controlled by multinational societies like the GAFAM and others and if we want a ""free"" web we must have decentralized datacenters. And is it possible to have decentralized storage, RAM and computing power.  

How ? Imagine that in like 10 years you open you recieve a new computer and install the software ""weweb"" like all the nerds do. And this software allows you to give access to the part of your computer you don't use for the other in exchange for a little bit of money.

And, in your city, someone wants to open a website, he install weweb to and can pay (idk it's just as an exemple) like 10 cents for 16 gb ram every hour he use it and the same amount for the computing power he need and the storage he need.

Finally the software see that you are just using word and he allow 50 % of your processore to the guy's website as he alow 50% of your ram and 100gb of your storage to this guy. Of course the software give this task to 10 computer so if one of them have a probleme it can be suport by the others.

So the problem of the datacenters which need lots of cooling and your pc wich you use 2h each day are solve is the same time.

For your opinion is it realist or pure fiction that we will have these type of systems in the futur.

1942,"I have made Base10 to Base2 algorithm that can handle a digit, stored in a string, of any arbitrary length. I want to put it into a flow chart. What I have now is it written on paper. It has been decades since I made a proper flow chart. I'd like to share the algorithm via a flowchart.","Here are the steps that I'd like to have in a flow chart.

Start: Input String with carry input as 0 and string iterator at the beginning

1. Build into the denominator the digit at the iterator. Value is the carry input \* 10 plus the starting digit.
2. Is the current denominator less than 2 and not at the last digit of the input string.
   1. Yes -> Append 0 to the output.  It is the result of division needing a 0 added to output string (output string eventually becomes the input string)
      1. Calculate the denominator by multiplying current denominator by 10 and adding to it the next digit.  (This makes the quantity now divisible by 2 in the algorithm)
      2. Move the digit iterator two digits in the input string. Move to outer step 3.
   2. No -> Is it finished?
      1.  Yes = at last digit and current denominator is less than 2.  Append this remainder to output and exit.
      2. No = move the digit iterator one in the input string. Move to outer step 3.
3. Build the output string with the integer division of the built-up denominator.
4. Build the output remainder as the modulus division by 2 of the built-up denominator.
5. Has the input string been fully processed?
   1. No -> Return to step 1 with the remainder as the carry input .
   2. Yes -> Append the remainder to the binary output.  Set the input string from the new output string that is the result of the input string with integer division by 2. Return to step 1 with 0 as the remainder as the carry input.

Sample input and output:

255 -> 11111111

254 -> 11111110

8675309 -> 100001000101111111101101

For this assignment I am to look into and find the unique language and communication found in the Computer Science community via. an Interview. If you want to answer but would rather another form of contact for any reason (email, phone, or another) please PM me and I will make things work.

&#x200B;

I will use the information I find to identify the ways the language is learned, what sort of genres members need to be familiar with (any sort of written genre such as email, summaries, notes, comments, headers, etc.), how language was evolved over time, and mechanisms that facilitate feedback within the community.

&#x200B;

Some of the personal information I will need for this includes:

• Your role in the community.

• How you first came to find the community.

• Your name (last name and title).

&#x200B;

Some questions regarding the community are:  
• Who is impacted most by the actions of this community. How does communication mostly take place?  
• How difficult is the process learning the language of this community?  
• Are there any documents, forms, papers, written or recorded materials that your community routinely creates. Why are these types of document chosen for the task at hand?

• How does your community want to come across to people outside of the community?  
• Is there a way for people outside of the community to contact the community for more information or to give feedback?  
• What does language accomplish in your community? Can you think of a specific example where language usage made an important difference  to the community?

I was just wondering if anyone had taken the advanced course or knows anything about it; it's called College Programming and Computer Science on the course info link, or if anyone can just share their experience with it. I think it will be very useful as you can get credit to Carnegie Mellon University, which I'm sure would transfer to other colleges, probably more likely than other dual enrollment credits. I just want to know if anyone has taken it and can tell me about it, for example, certain things I should remember and probably brush up on, as I haven't used Python in a while because AP CSA is all in Java.

Hey guys, 

As someone who is gonna start studying computer science in September this year, I just wanted to ask for any advice whatsoever. Like literally ANY advice at all would be appreciated.

I've got a bunch of time till my studies formally start and I'd like to be prepared, especially because I won't be studying in my native language (womp womp.) 

I finished my A Levels last year and didn't take computer science as a subject since I was still in my ""I'm-gonna-study-medicine"" days, so now I'm lowkey tweaking. (I took physics, maths, chemistry and bio.)

If anyone has any online course recommendations that might help with first year computer science  material, (they don't have to be designed for *total* beginners - I did take IGCSE comp sci, but idk if I'll really need any of what I've learnt) please, please let me know. 

Even advice on which math/programming or any other skills/subjects I should make sure I don't forget  would be greatly appreciated

Thank youuu

1988,Modified fast-doubling algorithm capable of calculating the 10^2013 number in the Fibonacci Sequence in 1 second," Here's the video proof and then some background: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9qN9dQEqYU&ab\_channel=TheBengal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9qN9dQEqYU&ab_channel=TheBengal)

 \-10\^2013 contains exactly 2014 digits. Most I've seen this script able to calculate is one that has 2020 digits

\-It does this \*every\* single time you run the algo down to within a .0001 second of itself

\-I feel like I'm crazy, and need some confirmation if this has ever been done before.

Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is not my point.

My point is that this could not be possible within the traditional fast-doubling algo. Mine does it every single time.

And uses less than 10% of my cpu.

Has this ever been accomplished with the fast-doubling method before? Note: I've also gotten 2020 digits before. In the video I published it got 2014.

.

Q2:  Is it correct that NRZI has two modes, one flip when 1 and one flip when 0?

2002,Do people not have to write a Bachelor's thesis to get a CS degree?,"Until a couple months ago, I always assumed writing a sort of academic thesis to complete your undergraduate degree is fairly common around the world.

At least where I am, getting a Bachelor's requires you to write one. You write around 50 pages (with proper citations and index and all that it might go up to 60 or 70), submit it and then defend the work in front of a small committee of your supervisor and professors with a small presentation and a Q&A session in order to graduate.

Topics can be fairly obscure depending on what department or group you are doing it under.

Some of the titles are things like

* ""Fine-grained Type Prediction of Entities
using Knowledge Graph Embeddings""
* ""Optimizing Parametric Dependencies for
Incremental Performance Model Extraction""
* ""Verifying Resource Sharing Proto-
cols in Real-Time Operating Systems""

I'm currently in what's equivalent of a high school with a integrated business/administration course, and to end my school year I must write a Final Paper (is this how those bigger researches are called in English?).

The current idea is to write about ways I'm which the administrative world can use modern day technology to automate and/or simplify tasks. Can anyone recommend some good books/articles that talk about the history of computer science and about the first companies that used computers to automate some of the work?

2097,Looking for guidance on becoming a Data Engineer as a struggling exCollege student?,"Hi I’m looking for guidance on what to do on my own to kickstart a career as a data engineer. I recently was forced to drop out of university because of financial trouble but would like to continue learning on my own. I am okay with investing some money in tools to help me learn but i simply cant afford to go back to school at this moment. I have an AS in Computer Science from my community college and the courses I have taken/topics I’ve learned about so far are Python(OOP, data structures and algorithms. Also, light knowledge about libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib), Discrete Mathematics, Statistics with R, and Computer Architecture. I feel as though I don’t really know the path to take to get closer to becoming a data engineer and would like some guidance on topics, and tools I should learn. Also, valuable resources you all may know of to assist in learning these things.

I have a general idea of what I need to learn but have no idea how to get actual practice that may replicate what actual computer engineers do or what learnings will actually contribute to a career as a computer engineer? What are your opinions on Coursera Certificates such as IBM Data engineering? Do they move too slow or do they teach you most of what I would need to learn? Is it best to find individual resources for each topic such as Andrew Ng’s course on machine learning? Are there certificates like CCNA that help get an entry level job that may lead to Computer Engineering?

2100,Spot Color Computers ,"Hello all! 
I’m an artist and doing my masters thesis on digital imagery and computer graphics. Being in the print & manufacturing industry for years, we use spot color which guarantees a color across the board (I’d consider it real color) 
Why can’t computer software o rocess a spot color the same? (A spot color would look different depending on the screen) 
Theoretically, is it possible for there to be a computer (not based on a binary system, or a different monitor)
That could display spot color, exactly the same, every time, no matter what?(Like the PANTONE, RAL, etc etc any “branded” color system)

I hope this isn’t a silly question, I’m sorry in advance! 😅
I’m very familiar with art terms and not so much in other worlds.

We've now found the time to build an MVP of the product we called: [oss.gg](https://oss.gg)

Not sure if there are many people interested in open source around here. But would love to get your take on the idea and app appraoch.

Everything is explained in detail on the landing page (or the talk).

What do you think? 🤓

2108,Data Structures along with AWS Cloud Practitioner Classes simultaneously ,"Would you recommend taking Data Structures along with AWS Cloud Practitioner at the same time?

For context, I'm currently enrolled in a 30 week course through South College in Knoxville. Each quarter is 10 weeks long, and they laid it out to take Intro to Programming, Linux OS, and Data Structures the first quarter. The second quarter I'd take AWS Cloud Practitioner, Intro to Networking, and Intro to Algorithms. The third quarter would be AWS Developer, Computer Architecture, and a class that's just called Programming Languages. 

I'm 7 weeks into the first quarter, however I dropped Data Structures in week 3 because Intro to programming is a pre requisite and I was struggling massively. I feel like I could've passed, but it would've been just by a hair and I probably wouldn't remember anything. I'd like to take 4 classes in the second quarter, one of them being Data Structures. But, Data Structures is apparently a pre requisite for AWS Cloud Practitioner. They aren't doing very well on explaining what the classes actually entail and Google isn't much help either. 

I'm unable to attach the ""schedule"" they sent me at the very beginning of enrollment, but it shows all of the pre requisites and such. I mapped it out and the only way to keep full time status is to take both of them. I'd rather keep my full time status and not go part time. However, if it's not feasible to take them together, I'll have to go part time status and extend my time to four quarters. 

I plan to go back to school when it's all over and pursue a bachelor's, I just wanted to do this first in hopes of getting an internship/career while I continue with the Computer Science bachelor's. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1709300394,376548,tboneee97,t2_emltcpev,ce098bf7bf4d6b4a5c1c04076e2881841469afdc34a8efbf55375e1011bbae06,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1b3uhoj/data_structures_along_with_aws_cloud_practitioner/

2144,Bootcamp scam,"I got my computer science degree from Ukraine, then I started applying for internships in all kind of IT companies (using Linkedin).

One day, a girl representing a bootcamp called me and guaranteed that after 4 months of studying frontend development they will find a job for me and that they have “partners” that they work with and I will be making a starting salary of 700$ a month (which is decent in Ukraine). Additionally, I don’t have to pay anything until I get a job. I agreed to sign it (since I needed a job).

They sent me a contract to sign, it had the following points.
•After i get a job in Ukraine in IT, I will need to pay them 15% of my net salary during 2 years.
•the bootcamp takes its part of my salary once i start making 500$ or more

the learning experience was very bad, most of it was following tutorial videos and solving exercises (freecodecamp style). I didn’t learn much with them. Especially since we only had 2 hours meetings once a week.

After I finished the bootcamp i was shocked to learn that we needed to build our cvs and send requests to companies via LinkedIn same as I was doing before, without any help from them. All they did is they reviewed my cv once.

After 2 months of searching i found an internship paying 300$ for 3 months. I took it. during the second month of internship, the war started and I was forced to leave Ukraine for Europe. With that salary I couldn’t even pay my rent in Europe so I had to find another job.

Now let’s talk about the issues:

* the contract stated that I had to pay the bootcamp only for income inside Ukraine, income outside Ukraine was a gray area and never mentioned.
* the taxes in Ukraine were 7%, in Europe the taxes  in the country where I live are 21% so I can’t pay an additional 15% for the bootcamp.
* I don’t think its worth it since they didn’t teach me much
* It’s been 2 years since they are chasing me and sending dms to my social media accounts asking me to pay.
I know I made a mistake when i signed the contract, what do you guys think?

2166,AI Health Monitoring of Shrimps? 🤔,"Hi, it has come to my attention that shrimps are quite challenging to rare at home. I'm planning to create an AI system where it will monitor the water parameters of my aquarium (pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite, etc.) then make decisions for me to maximize the life of my shrimps.

I'm planning to use reinforcement learning, so if the shrimps live longer, it'll be rewarded. But if the shrimps live shorter, it'll be punished. So, overtime, my shrimps will live longer and longer.

1) Do ya'll think a raspberry pi 5 (8gb ram, 2.4GHz) can do all this? Mainly the reinforcement learning part. 

2) Also, if i want to change the water, etc. can I turn off the rasp pi and turn it back on later without losing its previous learnings?",1709455793,376795,Ordinary_Owl_5969,t2_p5vz3rzu,c4f4e7471e91c6685095789658ac6da929cf664232c716cbefc05af7f23910ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1b5cmah/ai_health_monitoring_of_shrimps/

2180,Nursing or computer science/information systems ,"Do you guys think I should study computer science or nursing? I'm a junior in high school and I want to be a CRNA but I've also been wanting to study comp sci or information systems and get a job in that field but I'm just so torn.

On one hand I like medicine, science, and the idea of being a CRNA/ nurse is really appealing. I love the field of anesthesia and I would really like it work there. I like to think that I would make a great nurse (idk for sure tho) and I like the availability of jobs in nursing. I'm prepared for all the gross things and since I want to be a CRNA, I would work in ICUs as a nurse before CRNA school. My sister is studying nursing in college rn and I feel kind of bad deep down that I want to be a nurse because it feels like I'm somehow stealing her shine or something even though she said she doesn't care (and she's the type of person who truly is unbothered). It's just a weird insecurity I have. 

However, I also like computer science and coding sort of. I like that computer science is a shorter pathway (because you have to get a DNP to be a CRNA but I'm fine with that) but I'm not super enthusiastic about the competitiveness of undergrad programs and internships in recent years. 

I like the types of fields that you could go into in comp sci like ux design, machine learning, ai, data science, cyber security, and software engineering but I feel like it's getting oversaturated recently. 

BTW I'm taking AP computer science principles right now and I don't really understand parameters in coding. I've done well in all the other units except for parameters Is this a sign that the rest of computer science will be incredibly difficult for me? 

Pls feel free to let me know the pros and cons of both fields. Thank you all so much!

2188,Rows are a horrible name for horizontal items incrementing.,"And they do increment horizontally in most things in computer science, as in one on top of the other, I still get it confused to this day, likely because X-in-a-row, is taught to us as 'a number of things without interruption.'  


I propose we go back in time and make things incrementing downwards, in CSS, python, etc. called layers, that makes muuuch more associative sense in my head. The name row for how its commonly used should be removed entirely; layers and columns, one laying on top of another, and columns bringing to mind tall, great monolithic cylinders, makes more sense

Thanks for hearing nitpicking

2203,Is a Master Degree in a Computer Science Worth it?,"I am a freshman at the University of Missouri studying Computer Science. Mizzou offers a 4 +1 program to receive a master's degree. This means the first 4 years will be undergraduate courses but during your senior year, you can take a handful of classes that also count towards both undergraduate credit and master's credit so you would only have one additional year to get your master's.  


Additionally, I had some credits transferred in, and if I had no life I could technically get my masters in 4 years. If I wanted somewhat of a life I could take a more relaxed approach and get my masters in 5 years with a cyber security and and math minor. Mizzou also offers Masters research with a $1500 stipend each semester.   


With all that in mind, I am torn if it's worth it. I am a little on edge with the current job market and the rise of AI. Also, there's the additional cost, I am not sure if my current scholarships will carry over for a 5th year. On top of all of that, I hear mixed opinions on whether or not a master's degree makes a difference when being considered for various job positions, salary, etc. I am just looking for some general advice or options on whether or not I should continue my pursuit of a master's degree.

I was wondering if there is anybody who can help me do this or give me some advice.

I recently went out to eat at a Mexican restaurant, and the food and Service was awful, and gave myself and my company horrible food poisoning. When I called the next day asking for a refund, they said no and called the cops on us and had us trespassed.

I've seen other people make sites like this and upload them, I wrote a small 900 word piece of my opinion of the establishment and what happened and wanted to upload it so when ever someone googles the restaurant this hopefully pops up underneath it. It's my way of getting revenge, after a cop came to my door and told me I'm trespassed and can never go back.

To me they seem incredibly more difficult to understand at an intuitive level, especially those that allow faulty/byzantine nodes.

I never had any issues with understanding deterministic algorithms. In distributed algorithms, my brain tries to reason why a certain step in the algorithm is always true and it just shuts down. It feels like there are so many behaviours byzantine nodes can take, that it's almost impossible to be sure it will always be correct. I tried reading proofs and I often understand why it works at a mathematical level, but I can't seem to grasp it at an intuitive level.

2253,NCSU (full ride) or Georgia Tech (out of state)?,"NCSU (full ride) or Georgia Tech (OOS) for CS?

For some context, I just received admission to the [park scholars](https://park.ncsu.edu) program at NC State Univeristy, which is an all-inclusive four-year scholarship that covers, tuition, fees, room & board, books, and personal expenses. NC state is close to home and in the research triangle, which would have its advantages.

However, I have also been admitted to Georgia Tech for CS, which I will likely pay out-of-state tuition for if I choose to attend.

I’ve been told by many people that Georgia Tech is still the better choice in CS due to its curriculum and reputation, which would be particularly helpful in this job market and I do believe, but I am not sure if those benefits outweigh going to NCSU for free. 

I’ve also heard that Georgia tech often provides scholarships to out of state students after they are admitted that make the school substantially more affordable. Is this true?

On the contrary, I’ve been told that the academic culture at tech can be very stressful and toxic and that being part of such a small scholarship program (~35 students) at NCSU can provide me with research and career opportunities that beat what the average GT student may receive.

Any words of wisdom from alumnus of either school or anyone else with information on computer science? Is it worth the opportunity costs for that gap of prestige?

2301,Difference between keyboard/scroll wheel input handling? ,"Hi, not a computer science person but I do get interested in things!

I’m playing a game and I notice that when a series of actions are performed a “combo” where the moves chain/cancel into eachother, the game will not handle the scroll input the same as a keyboard input. 

I am guessing that it handles the buffer of actions waiting to be performed by taking new inputs and skipping them ahead based on what type of input it was (keystroke, vs scroll up)

Also, I want to use the scroll wheel to do some game actions such as scope or jump, the game will let me assign the input but it just doesn’t do anything? 

I just learned about using the registry to change things so maybe I can do it in there because my razor software doesn’t let me remap wheel to keyboard. (Unless I have overlooked it).

My ideal situation is that scroll up could be mapped to a keystroke with a 100 MS delay between executions to prevent a double scroll from being added to the input queue. (Like immediately scope in then out by accident) .

It’s not a huge deal if it’s not possible but it’s more soI need to understand it.

Even if you can just link me somewhere I’d appreciate it because I’m finding it hard to research.

2310,How I Reduced Our LLM Costs by Almost 90%,"With AI apps popping up everywhere, it’s fair to think building one is both easy and cheap.

Unfortunately, you’d be *(mostly)* wrong. I know because I learned the hard way.

I’m not saying it’s hard per se, but as of this writing, gpt-4-turbo costs $0.01/$0.03 per 1000 input/output tokens. This can quickly add up if you’re building a complex AI workflow.

Yes, you could use less expensive, worse performing models, like GPT 3.5 or an open-source one like Llama, stuff everything into one API call with excellent prompt engineering, and hope for the best. But this probably won’t turn out that great. This type of approach doesn’t really work in production—at least not yet with the current state of AI.

**It could give you the right answer 90% or even 99% of the time.** But that one time it decides to go off the rails, it’s really frustrating. As a developer and/or business, you know you must never break a user’s experience. It might be okay for a toy app or prototype but not for a production-grade application you charge for.

Imagine if Salesforce or any other established software company said its reliability was only one or two nines. That would be insane. No one would use it.

**But this is the state of most AI applications today. They’re unreliable.**

# AI isn’t a Universal Function

The non-deterministic nature of LLMs forces us to be more thoughtful about how we write our code. We should not just “hope” that an LLM will always correctly respond. We need to build redundancy and proper error handling. For some reason, many builders forget everything they learned about software engineering and treat AI like some magical universal function that doesn’t fail.

**It’s not there yet.**

To fix this limitation, we must write code that only interacts with AI when absolutely necessary—that is, when a system needs some sort of “human-level” analysis of unstructured data. Subsequently, whenever possible, we must force the LLM to return references to information (i.e., a pointer) instead of the data itself.

**When I recognized these two things, I had to redesign the backend architecture of my personal software business completely.**

# Rearchitecting Jellypod

For context, I started an app called Jellypod. It enables users to subscribe to email newsletters and get a daily summary of the most important topics from all of them as a single podcast.

This seems pretty simple on the outside—and the MVP honestly was. The app would just process each email individually, summarize it, convert it to speech, and stitch all the audio together, side-by-side, into a daily podcast.

The output was fine, but it needed to be better.

If two different newsletters discussed the same topic, the “podcast” would talk about it twice, not realizing we had already mentioned it. You could say, “Well, why don’t you just stuff all the newsletter content into one big LLM call to summarize everything?”

Well, that’s what I tried at first.

And it failed. **Miserably.**

Even with an extremely detailed prompt using all the best practices, I couldn’t guarantee that the LLM would always detect the most important topics, summarize everything, and consistently create an in-depth output. Also, the podcast always needed to be \~10 minutes long.

So I went back to the drawing board. How can I make this system better? And yes, we’re getting to the cost reduction part - don’t worry!

# Defining the Requirements

Jellypod must be able to process any number of input documents (newsletters) and create an output that always includes the top ten most important topics across all those inputs. If two subparts of any input are about the same topic, we should recognize that and merge the sections into one topic.

For example, if the Morning Brew has a section about US Elections and the Daily Brief also has a section on the current state of US Politics, they should be merged. I’ll skip over how I determined a similarity threshold (i.e., should two topics be merged or remain separate).

# Exploding Costs

I built on top of a few different approaches outlined in papers written by the LangChain community to semantic chunk and organize everything in a almost deterministic way.

**But this was INSANELY expensive.** The number of API calls grew at a rate of O(n log n), with n being the number of input chunks from all newsletters.

So, I had a dilemma. Do I keep this improved and more expensive architecture or throw it down the drain?

I decided to keep it and figure out how to reduce costs.

# Reducing Costs

That’s when I discovered a tool called OpenPipe that allows you to fine-tune open-source models almost too easily. It looked legit and was backed by YCombinator, so I gave it a try.

I swapped out the OpenAI SDK with their SDK (a drop-in replacement), which passed all my LLM API calls to OpenAI but recorded all inputs and outputs. This created unique datasets for each of my prompts, which I could use to fine-tune a cheaper open-source model.

After about a week of recording Jellypod’s LLM calls, I had about 50,000 rows of data. And with a few clicks, I fine-tuned a Mistral 7B model for each LLM call.

I replaced GPT-4 with the new fine-tuned model.

**And it reduced the costs by 88%.**

The cost of inference dropped from $10 per 1M input tokens to $1.20. And cost per output token dropped from $30 to $1.60.

I was blown away. I could now run Jellypod’s new architecture for approximately the same cost as the MVP’s trivial approach. I even confirmed that the fine-tuned Mistral output quality was just as high as GPT-4 by a series of evals and in-app customer feedback.

By redesigning the system to only use AI for the smallest unit of work it’s actually needed for, I could confidently deploy a fine-tuned model as a drop-in replacement for GPT 4. And by prompting to return pointers to data instead of the data itself, I could ensure data integrity while reducing the number of output tokens consumed.

# In Conclusion

If you’re considering building an AI application, I would encourage you to take a step back and think about your architecture’s output reliability and costs. What happens if the LLM doesn’t answer your prompt in the right way? Can you prompt the model to return data identifiers instead of raw data? And, is it possible to swap GPT-4 with a cheaper, fine-tuned model?

I wish I had these insights when I started, but hey, you live and learn.

I hope you found at least some parts of this interesting! I thought there were enough learnings to share.

2315,AI is the best thing that has recently happened in the scope of Computer Science.,"I hear a lot of folks getting scared about AI.

Open your eyes, AI is Computer Science. Fellow future Computer Scientists, you are the people that will understand its mechanics. You are the ones that will develop it. AI will never be a black box because society to thrive need people that understand this technology.

The world is getting more and more digital. Computers are everywhere and your knowledge is worth every penny. Having AI applications everywhere opens so many doors to you. There are still endless applications unsolved and complexity only grows.

Don't get discouraged by sensationalist titles from media saying AI is automating X and Y. They do it because its easy engagement. It's an unethical marketing/sales strategy that unfortunately spreads a lot of panic. I'm telling you here, the moment AI automates software development, that means the code for every other job/field is already written (accountant, lawyer, architect, drivers, engineers, etc). We don't even have perfect self-driving cars and you are scared about AI? You should be developing it (AI) to enable new technology where it is currently impossible! There are still infinite problems to be tackled.

2318,How much discrete math is necessary?,"I’m taking a discrete math course this semester. The topics I come across in the book usually relates to some area in CS.  Often times, there is a reference to a certain algorithm. However a lot of it still feels super theory focused. So I feel like when I spend too much time reading about theory, I’m not actually improving upon my ability to code and solve computer problems in real time.  I wish to spend more time doing leetcode style problems. Will not understanding discrete math to a deep level affect my ability to code and problem solve? I would like to hear your thoughts for those who have more experience. Please and thank you.

2354,Novel Study Techniques to Study Computer Science Concepts?,"It's a known fact that computer science is inherently a tough field to grasp concepts because of its abstract nature and interdependency with lots of concepts at once.

What study techniques besides active recall, repetition(and those general study tips found in Ali Abdaal's youtube video) are useful to actually understand ""tough concepts"".

Some methods I've devised so far:

- Start with exercises on textbook and study in order to solve them.

- Study in Iteration Based Model. Example study chapter 1 in first iteration. Skip some topics. When you come back after ending the current iteration by studying every chapters to next iteration, you again study chapter 1's skipped topics.

What else novelty methods you follow? I find computer science too tough to ""actually understand"", easier to ""bluff"". The weird thing is that I am a Computer Science grad and I still feel lacking in ""actual"" computer science.

When I try to build softwares, write SQL, performance tune the system, develop games etc I always find myself coming back to the concepts of these subjects:

- distributed systems, computing and algorithms

- database management systems

- operating systems

- computer networks

- network and web security

- data structures and algorithms

- computer graphics, linear algebra

- artificial intelligence, neural networks

- computer organization and architecture, embedded systems

etc. It bothers me a lot that I am not proficient in all of these things. I accept that these things are tough but I really want to learn no matter how much time it takes me.

2358,Teammate finder algorithm for MOBA,"Hi guys I'm asking if it's good to use Bin Packing Algorithm for a teammate finder for MOBA games.

What I have in mind is that whenever a player joins queue he is put in a bin where he is suited each player weighs 1 and each bin can hold 5.

2365,"Studying Aggregate Analysis in CLRS and I am confused by its explanation of the ""wrong"" way to analyze. Any help?","I am on CLRS 3rd ed on page 453. It is discussing aggregate analysis as it pertains to push and pop methods. It introduces the `Multipop` method as such:

    Multipop(S,k):
        while not STACK-EMPTY(S) and k > 0:
            POP(S)
            k = k - 1

`S` is the stack itself, and `k` is the number of items to pop from the stack. 

Here is how I understand the code from a time-complexity standpoint.

    Multipop(S,k):
        while loop:       O(n) times 
            pop function: O(1) 
            assignment:   O(1) 

Thus, multipop function would have a time complexity of O(n) + O(1) + O(1), or more simply O(n). 

**Here is the part of the book that I am confused about****:** ""Let us analyze a sequence of *n* PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an initially empty stack. The worst case of a MULTIPOP operation in the sequence is O(n), since the stack size is at most *n.* The worst-case of any stack operation is therefore O(n), ***and hence a sequence of n operations costs O(n\^2), since we have O(n) MULTIPOP operations costing O(n) each*****.** Although this analysis is correct, the O(n\^2) result, which we obtained by considering the worst-case cost of each operation individually is not tight.""

So it seems like the book is affirming that I am right, but I genuinely don't understand how you could ever get O(n\^2) time complexity for this algorithm. What are they talking about? 

Is it because you take the `Multipop` function as having a time complexity of O(n) and the while loop inside of the `Multipop` function as having a time complexity of O(n), and you for some reason multiply those together?

2400,Can this approach work for the houses csp problem?,"Hi! Im working on a CSP problem for my AI class,  this type of problem

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TXJ-k9ljDo0

And I was thinking for the initial state of the problem, we already know that regardless of orientation, there are 5 nationalities, 5 pets, 5 favorite drinks, 5 favorite candies, and 5 house colors. If thats the case, why start the problem with an empty state when we can just assign all of the variables initially (either in order or randomly?)

That way, at least some of them will be initially correct, and all the algorithim needs to do is swap everything so its in the correct spot.

Thats my thinking, but i have a weird feeling that im overlooking some important detail. is there anything about this general approach that is flawed?",1710106802,377881,aronamous61,t2_nsh9shr8h,fc4b726161d00049f243e715cdf3a1b1b164fcf582e756313e7ef9a51b41f4e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bblxgd/can_this_approach_work_for_the_houses_csp_problem/
2401,Combinatorial optimization (compendium),"Hi, all

Some time ago I got an interesting interview challenge problem (Software Engineer):  


*""You have X volunteers, Y tasks. Each task has a complexity and each volunteer X**^(i)* *can solve Y**^(j)* *task with some time T**^(i)**j... Volunteers can get several tasks, tasks also have priorities..etc. You need to provide optimal distribution of tasks assuming that we need to optimize time of completion all the tasks""*  


I don't remember exact statement, but that was something that could be solved with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian\_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm)  


Got a naive solution that looked more or less ok, but I would like to learn all the ways and optimizations that could be done depends on different conditions and variation of such combinatorial optimization problems.  


I have some problems with keeping myself focused reading CS books (I drop often), so, I would prefer something more practical, but I would appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!

I've recently downloaded a large zip file that I want to extract. How can I do this because if I try to do it the normal way by clicking on ""extract"" my pc gives a notification that I don't have enough storage. What I think is happening is that my PC tries to move the files to the selected folder but instead of just moving them he duplicates everything. I already checked and I defenitely have enough free storage.

I don't know much about PC's but basically I think I need double the amount of storage but because the zip file is 107 GB I don't have 214 GB so is there another way?

I already tried 7 zip but it doesn't work because it also just duplicates the files.

One error correction scheme I thought of was to send 3 bits, which is able to correct a single bit of error or 33.3% noise (1/3). If I send 101 bits, then I could correct up to 50 errors or 49.5% noise (50/101). In the limit, the message will be correctly sent with up to 50% noise.

I am not sure if this is correct, but one way I thought of improving this was by using a Hamming codes. Making 15 copies of the 101bit block for Hamming(15,11) would allow for 1 of the 15 blocks to be corrected. Afterwards, the 11 data blocks would be able to handle 45.5% noise (5/11). I am not sure how to calculate the maximum amount of noise the 101 \* 15 bits would be able handle, or if swapping things around for 101 copies of Hamming(15,11) would be better/worse. I am not sure if Hamming(7,4) would work well, since it has an even amount of data bits.

Alternatively, making 23 copies of the 101bit block for Binary Golay(23,12) codes would allow for 3 of the 23 blocks to be corrected. The remaining 12 data blocks could handle 45.5% noise (5/11), ignoring the last block to make the amount of data blocks an odd number.  


Is 50% noise the maximum any error correction scheme could theoretically handle?",1710284238,378126,Vortex876543,t2_ameud76o,081aae9f6511bec9ab0cf1589d410cbb8aa11dfbf5f2501394603bd16ca15a84,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bdbdmz/what_is_the_theoretically_strongest_error/

2464,Is a memory address an actual physical location in RAM?,"Not sure if this is a silly question but I guess it will help me understand more intuitively how memory works… 

Let’s say I have a variable stored to some memory address.  And I want to alter the value at that address.  Would it be theoretically possible to actual look at my physical RAM and locate where this data actually is? For instance, if I have “64k” of RAM, there are 65,536 bytes,  would the first byte be physically located at a an actual location “1” on the hardware chip or some general region? Or is this a more dynamic process and the bytes are reassigned every time memory is allocated?  

If this is the case, is it also theoretically possible to alter it via some other means rather than having my program access the memory address and alter the value? Or does the OS allocate a chunk of memory and then assign each byte “virtually” in some sense.

Or they sound so much like wishful thinking that they make me feel even worse.

I feel truly lost and like I should pivot to some other field, but which I have no idea. Everything similar will likely be affected at some point, and I don't really have interests in manual labour or a trade.

2477,CS major advice,"Hi guys I’m curious what your thoughts are.

Just be real with me I’m not here to start a debate nor argue let alone cause any issues.

I’m currently attending The University of Michigan and am going in for CS. I’m at a point where I can switch out if needed. I will graduate around 2026-2027. Do you guys think I will be able to actually get a job outside of college or is the CS market over saturated to the point mixed with AI (such as Devin) where it’s a “who knows” situation? This is a major I’m fascinated with, but it isn’t my true passion as business is, but I can’t get into UofM’s Ross school of business unfortunately they are knit picky as FUCK as really only want freshman’s (I’m a transfer they accept around 80 for reference…). It’s a bit too late for me to switch to business as I’d have like 150 credits by the time I get a business degree so CS just seemed like the route for me. I just really want to make sure this field will actually yield me a job. For example my tutor who is a coding wizard. He’s only a tutor because he can’t get employed. 

I PROMISE YOU I am not some snobby asshole when I say this if anything I’m the furthest thing from it, but let’s say I have my CS degree. Will I get a job before him? Or will he get the job first and I’ll be stuck in his position where I’ll wait a year or two just to get a CS related job? If so then I have backup plans. I’m mainly in school for my dad because my brother dropped out and my dad is very highly educated. I will get a business for graduating alongside have a business already to run so I’m not worried about actually making money. I just want to make sure I’m not wasting my time studying a degree that I can be self studying and enjoy 100x more at my own pace. I feel like a MORON in my CS class because everyone around me are actual coders they aren’t literally beginners like me and we have multi thousand line projects just for pre reqs… so you can imagine how much fun I’m having… 

I’m in CS because I want a remote job as that’s how I’ll be able to run my businesses while having a career job. Should I switch out or do you think I should keep my head up and I’ll be fine getting a job in today’s market as reference, but in 2026ish?


TLDR:
Sorry for the long comment just don’t get the wrong idea I’m not saying I’m better than anybody as a matter of fact I’d say by the time I graduate I’ll be an average coder vs learning myself because the shit we are learning is so unnecessarily complex I just can’t follow along properly. Will an average coder with a UofM degree get a good job or am I screwed? If so then I’m swapping. Thank you all for your time and have a good one! Were you guys able to find jobs easily?

(AI replacing us in few yrs?),"I started my CS studies about 2 yrs ago and now on my 2nd yr, I never thought it would happen so quick since so many people back then were saying AI will take decades to become a human level developer, but then ppl started saying AI will do most of the coding and just need a developer to manage it, but now it seems it might just replace all developers?

2488,Hyperparameter sampling for Bayesian Optimization,"Hi, I am dealing with Student T Bayesian optimization and I want to estimate the kernel parameters. So far I have simply maximized the marginal posterior likelihood of the Student Process to retrieve the hyperparameters but I would like to make a step forward sampling from the distribution in order to integrate my Expected Improvement using a full bayesian approach.Currently, I am using the same loglikelihood used for the Maximum Likelihood to perform a slice sampling over the variables. The problem is that I can't see any improvement in my code hence I am thinking that there is some mistake with the sampling. I am using the slice sample function of MATLAB assuming it works well.I have also tried using Hamilton Monte Carlo Markov Chains but still no improvement.Have you any idea what could be the mistake I am making? At the end is only a matter of putting the same loglike in the sampling function.",1710409439,378337,Mediocre-Village5801,t2_anw8bu4c,2db81cc2034866366fe901a6712d08ee3c1c568fc94ccbaab8dd8729acff8c9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1behe3v/hyperparameter_sampling_for_bayesian_optimization/

2662,Recent Electrical Engineering Grad Looking to Transition to Front-End Development - Advice Needed!,"**Hey Reddit**,

I recently graduated with a degree in electrical engineering, but after some time in the field, I'm realizing it's not the long-term path I want to take. My passion for computers has always been strong, and I'm seriously considering a career switch to front-end development.

Everyone seems to recommend Python as a great starting point, and I'm definitely interested in learning it. However, with its widespread use, I'm also curious about what specialization to pursue afterwards.

**Here's what I'm drawn to:**

* **Front-End Development:** I find the visual nature and the ability to see my creations come to life highly motivating.
* **Web Applications:** The prevalence of this field in today's world makes it an attractive option.

**My questions for the community:**

* **Is my thought process logical?**
* **What roadmap would you recommend for efficiently learning front-end development?**
* **Is this a field with a promising future considering the rise of AI?**
* **Should I consider a different programming language or specialization altogether?**

Any advice or insights from experienced developers would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1710422020,378356,Sweetpablosz,t2_8i8bjxe6,10709b6d1290bdde235028865d93ae51e284ccf7f0bd0651a1f0ea8accfee848,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bekvin/recent_electrical_engineering_grad_looking_to/

2681,The Realities of the AI Developer,"Ever since Turing the idea of human-like machine intelligence floated around, but with recent advancements in computing power neural networks have deepened. The inclusion of GPT techniques have allowed the pushing of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) to heights never before seen. And now with the announcement of [Devin, the AI Software Engineer](https://www.cognition-labs.com/), the nails in the coffin of the profession that nearly all CS majors end up in is finally being hammered in. I hope to convince you of the opposite: many of the companies behind the push aren't the humanists they claim to be, and their claims are exaggerated or even completely fabricated.

Neural networks have been around for quite some time, [the idea dates back to the 1950s](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400882618-002/html). But the fundamental concept hasn't really evolved since. Sure, the techniques have gotten more clever, but essentially we're still relying on the fundamental perceptron design. Which, *if it works it works*. And it does quite well as a statistical learning technique. However, the important distinction that a while these are called neural networks they are massively different than human brains, both in operation and fundamental structure. [You don't have to take my word for it, though](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/03/1020247/artificial-intelligence-brain-neuroscience-jeff-hawkins/).

In 2021, Dr. Melanie Mitchell published a paper titled [*Why AI is Harder Than We Think*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12871)*,* in a direct challenge to the AI researchers of today. While I wholly endorse reading the paper in its entirety, Dr. Mitchell brought up four fallacies that AI researchers fall for (and as a consequence, the population that listens to them).

1. Narrow intelligence is on a continuum with general intelligence
2. Easy things are easy and hard things are hard
3. The lure of wishful mnemonics
4. Intelligence is all in the brain

Dr. Mitchell further argues that AI springs are common and followed by an AI winter. We are presently in an AI spring, and an AI winter is coming. It's powerful logic that's mostly been ignored by the larger AI community, who insist that [AGI is right around the corner](https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/sam-altman-ai-agi-marketing).

But [self-driving cars are still not a reality](https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/transportation/2024/02/14/waymo-issues-voluntary-recall-for-self-driving-car-software), and they were promised as early as 2015. We were promised by Elon Musk that they were going to take over. Ten years later we're still waiting and trillions of dollars have been spent on what seems to be the new fusion. So maybe it's time we stop listening to billionaires and start listening to real computer scientists, like Dr. Mitchell.

But truly these companies have made some very great advancements in the field of AI. And it's true, but i has come at a massive cost. The [electricity demands are massive](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/) in a time when power consumption should be optimized on the dangerous precipice of a warming planet. The datasets used by OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft were hardly ethically obtained. And so we're left with a troubling realization that it certainly seems like this is just the new business craze (remember NFTs? Blockchain?) instead of a truly humanist pursuit. And those that cheer on them on hoping for the tech utopia of their dreams is just another form of wishful thinking.

So no, AGI isn't upon us, no matter how many times the [company who tried to trademark GPT](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075304/trademark-pto-openai-gpt-deny) tries to will it to be through marketing materials. An [Apple esque-bar graph](https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/devin-performance.png) is hardly scientific, and these companies are not ethical. They are out to make money, and have an invested interest in making the grandiose claims you see plague the news.

I’m a young software developer approaching my second anniversary since starting at my company. I’ve had some great experiences and learned a lot. 

When I started studying cs I was told that there are more jobs than people to fill them. I landed this job off connections and believe I have been beneficial to this company since starting. I’ve looked around elsewhere because it is a smaller company and pay isn’t what I’d like. 

Everywhere I turn I only see listings for senior developers and even the non senior ones I cannot even get myself an interview. I’ve been denied for over 50 other positions that I’ve been qualified for. 

I’m grateful for my position but am just seeking career happiness. Is it worth continuing to develop and see where I can go or just scratch it up as a loss and seek another industry.

2691,What should I do?,"
Hi everyone,
I am currently a 16 year old living in Texas studying computer science. I want to eventually go to the UT CS+B honors program and build software startups.

I like to think of my self as a top 1% in my grade level when it comes to programming. I’ve been building since I was 6, far outperformed all adult software engineers at a software startup etc. But I haven’t really done anything interesting - just decent ideas and some full stack development.

When I hear my parents talk about work building things that had large impacts on the world, things like work on hyperviser, security under the Os etc, it makes me think. They always push me to do something deeper . “Don’t become a web dev, stay in school and focus on learning “ they say. 

I’ve been building multiple small scale SAAS applications using things like react, swift etc. using chat gpt to do a lot of the boring grunt work. And this has me feeling ; is all of this what I’m doing just for a quick 60k salary? Is this all just low level web dev that’ll make me nothing in the future after being replaced with gpt? Am I learning skills that won’t be valuable in the future?

So I ask to you; what skills should I learn to stand out and be a top 1% cs major? Is it AI, is it blockchain, is it quantum computing? What should I do to prepare?

2699,In Search of Comprehensive Books on Network Architecture," Hello everyone, I'm currently in my second year of computer engineering, and I've been completely captivated by my network architecture class. We've delved into the OSI model, TCP/IP, and the intricacies of how each layer functions, and it's both overwhelming and utterly fascinating. The complexity and elegance of network systems have sparked a desire in me to deepen my understanding beyond the classroom. I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for recommendations on books that thoroughly cover computer networking.

2892,MBA or CS? ,"I recently completed my undergraduate program and got my bachelors in CS. During that time I had one internship/job as a software engineer at a small company for about a year. I also got the Security+ cert during that time (sponsored by the company I interned at). 

Now, I decided I want to go for a masters degree. Further down the line in my career I’d like to teach CS at a University, but for now I just want to get a job that pays decently but has a relaxed schedule or remote work.

I’m a pretty extroverted person, so I have been considering an MBA to get into tech sales. I’d also go cyber/SWE route so long as I can get a nice remote position. Im leaning towards an MBA to diversify my education and make me employable in different industries, but I feel like the only crossover I’ve found has been tech sales. Any recommendations are appreciated!

2942,Is it Possible to Pursue an MSc in Cybersecurity or AI After Completing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University?,"Hey everyone! I'm currently in the process of applying to Sichuan University for a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, with the intention of starting in the September 2024 intake. But I am kind of skeptical about applying for Software engineering after seeing some posts about this field.

My initial plan was to pursue a master's degree in one of the fields like Cybersecurity or AI after completing my bachelor's. I've heard differing opinions about whether studying software engineering could limit my opportunities. I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice from those familiar with the industry or Sichuan University's program.

2956,Looking for some life/career guidance.,"I am 27 years old (M) when I was 19 I studied computer science for a year and the next year I  switched to electrical engineering, but I was not able to finish due to external circumstances. Since I dropped out I have been hopping from job to job trying to make more money to make ends meet.  Mostly working in retail and currently working in healthcare as a custodian.

&#x200B;

I'm getting tired of my job and I want to do something more meaningful, and I'm trying to get a career in a tech related field. I'm thinking of data analytics or software development, I'm currently taking the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera just to see what it's about and I am half way through it. I'm enjoying it so far but I know it will take a lot more than just a cert to land a job. 

&#x200B;

I browse entry level jobs online and I see way more posts for senior level roles and data scientist roles. Is the job market in this field as saturated as some say it is? I understand that getting into a career such as this takes a lot of time and effort which I am willing to put in but I am also worried about making sure I invest my time properly on the right topics and gaining the right skills. I have also been thinking about front end software development. I don't have any experience in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but I have taken a couple course in java so coding is not something that is completely new for me. I'm not trying to come off as lazy or entitled but I am curious about where the most opportunity will be now and in the future, I will be 30 in a few years and I would really like to have a family one day. I would like to be a little more established before starting that chapter of my life first.

&#x200B;

I would appreciate input from anyone, and could really use some guidance/direction. 

Thank you ",1710635228,378754,Mer_Q_ree,t2_77x7urlo,f584a40094dfd995fcf33ba9ae6b9e0c0af39656df92f15fd5b391ea9a2b4265,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bgkfu2/looking_for_some_lifecareer_guidance/

2958,Accountant to data analyst then to developer / engineer role? ,"I’m an accountant that I have no exposure to coding at work. I’ve learnt coding for two years, self taught, trying to pivot into software engineering or development but no luck as I don’t have a CS degree. 

There is an internal opportunity that I can potentially do some basic DA work (however it’s a long shot). But I’m unsure if it’s actually going to happen because I will need an official transfer to IT team - IT will not give me database access until I join. My team wants me to show some basic understanding toward data before letting me transfer. So now I have to learn data, on top of my daily learning in coding, and that piles up a lot work.  

So with the eventual SDE role in mind, does it make sense for me to transfer into DA, and then to SDE? I mean, DA has to be more relevant with coding than accountant, right?

2960,Why doesn't a monitor KVM instantly show picture on display after switching sources?,"That's the correct answer regarding the EDID emulation built-in to a high-end DisplayPort KVM switches you can find.   However, currently, 99% of DisplayPort KVM switches in the market did not deliver the EDID emulation solution to get the switching time of DisplayPort monitor sharing with low-latency.  

So, even you get some high-price DisplayPort KVM switches,chances are the DisplayPort 1.4 EDID emulation and EDID feeding will be still missed.   Why it's so hard to make a DisplayPort EDID emulation built-in to each connected systems of a KVM switch ?   

1. High development Cost:   There are no DisplayPort EDID emulators IC chip available (still), and DisplayPort EDID emulations are required to be built and created from the ground up without existing IC already released. 

2. High production cost:  for example, for a dual DP 1.4 monitor sharing KVM switch for 2 computers, totally number of DisplayPort 1.4 emulator required will be 4.  if each costs between $40\~50, then we are talking about adding about $200 cost for the built-in DP 1.4 emulators along.  $40\~50 will be the build costs what normally MSRP for end-user will be around $150/each. 

With the true costs to develop and build a DisplayPort KVM switch with EDID emulation and EDID feeding to all connected systems in mind, you should appreciate a high-end DP 1.4 KVM for 4 systems selling at the KVM switch under $1000.  It's a steal to get a dual DP1.4 monitor sharing for 4 connected systems (totally EDID emulator required will be 8 of them internally within the KVM switch).

2961,How do you rotate an image matrix into 2d vectors containing their x and y coordinate?,"Ok, I've been studying 3Blue1brown videos of how matrices work, and I've been looking at visual kernels videos, on how an image can be translated to 2d space by imagining them as points on 2d space. I just have one more curiosity, how are we able to apply a 2d rotation matrix to say a simple 3x3 black and white image??? The 2d rotation matrix is 2x2 and the image has a matrix of 3x3. But that 3x3 matrix only specifies the intensity of white color, not the vector space.   


So then I guess in my head what would essentially happen is:  
1. There is a way to map each value of  that 3x3 intensity matrix to 2d vector spaces to draw on the screen of the computer 

2. Once that is figured out, there is a way to also individually rotate all of this matrix with the rotation matrix??

Are those assumptions correct?

2994,Variant of point set coverage problem,"I have the following problem for which i am searching resources/algorithms.

Given two Point Sets P1, P2 in 2D-space, I want to find distinct subsets S1,…Sn and T1,…,Tn of P1/P2 such that the union T1,…,Tn = P2 and the pairs of subsets Si, Ti are equal except for a rotation/translation. I further have the restriction that These subsets must be contained within a fixed region in space e.g. described by a convex polygon G which can be shifted/rotated arbitrarely. 
My goal is to find an algorithm that is able to do that, and ideally minimizes the amount if subsets n. 

In which category does this problem belong?
Are there similar problems you know of? If so, are there established algorithms?

My current solution is a tree-search, which works okay if the Point Sets are on a rectangular Grid.

3010,(Autism) Comp sci lack of motivation + Constant irritation,"

Hey everybody,

Last year or so I made a post about depression and being stuck in a rut during university (find it on my reddit username page). Good news is that I'm in my last semester and will graduate in the spring time. Yeah for me. But this had been one of the lowest points of my year. I don't have much of a goal or aspirations outside finishing school besides getting a job and moving out from my parents. But even that is over whelming and causes me much anxiety due to fear of rejection and thinking that there's so much to do just to even get a job is so much for me that O get tired and unmotivated before I even begin. My Dad says I lack drive and I don't try which I think he is partially right about that but most of my Trying is based off of fighting my own depression and anxiety on a day to day basis. I sleep in late as that's the only thing I enjoy and it causes me the least stress. I also watch intense movies as that helps with distractions.

It's just my main problem is being passionate again in comp sci and doing something to move me forward. I still feel stuck in a rut.

MOST IMPORTANT: I have constsnt irritation and ocd like tendencies like intense intrusive thoughts. They plagued me me all day and small things can cause big devastating feelings for me which really bothers to no end. Like just recently I was scrolling through Instagram and saw an old post from my follower and accidentally liked it. I quickly unlike it but now I feel embarrassed and stupid and the damages are done and it'll ruin me. I also wash my hands obsessively which leads them to dry out and have cracks and cuts from the cleaning. If I touch my ears I get irritation so much I must wash my hands. If I spill something or make a mistake I make such a big fuss in my head that I can't take it anymore.

I can't even go on car rides as I get ocd thoughts of grabbing the wheel and crashing the car or just jumping out and hopefully be run over. I also have thoughts of harm to others and myself which are sometimes intrusive and sometimes feelings of complete anger and irritability from my situation with not having any special interests or forward direction for distraction.

I am seeing a psychiatrist who is prescribing me zoloft, seroquel and klonopin (before ativan) but I feel like they don't take the edge off and make me really tired . Like can't get out of bed or bad digestion problems.

Has anyone experience similar things and can give me pointers? Even writing this post gives me anxiety due to sharing but I feel like I got no other choices. Argh this sucks.

3028,Help Choosing Between Consulting Engineering and Cybersecurity Internships,"Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

I'm graduating in December and have two internship offers for the summer: one as a Consultation Engineer and the other in Cyber Security Vulnerability. I'm trying to figure out which path has better job prospects post-graduation, especially considering rapid advancements in AI and its impact on cybersecurity jobs. I am graduating in December with a CS degree.

&#x200B;

The Consultation Engineer intern role involves optimizing cloud solutions for businesses.

The Cyber Security Vulnerability intern will work on identifying and mitigating system vulnerabilities, a field rumored to be heavily impacted by AI automation.

I'm looking for insights on:

3031,"Contributions in Software Development, Formal Methods and New Discoveries","Everyone knows that great efforts are being made to generate valuable contributions in software development, but some successful applications, which usually generate considerable capitalization, are accompanied by a deep theoretical background that supports them.

In this context, I wanted to share with everyone Professor Ohad Asor's profound work, Theories and Applications of Boolean Algebras, a cornerstone in the development of the Tau language, which is ingeniously based on formal specification and can greatly improve and facilitate software development.

These contributions are accompanied by the patenting of different discoveries and developments they've made over ten years. I see this patenting is not just a legal process but a robust shield that safeguards all the advances in the knowledge framework and the development of Tau as a system. It marks a significant milestone in the professionalization of their work, ensuring its secure and progressive future.Reaching this new stage culminates years of their study on formal methods that have been questioned before of not having any proof to back them up.

It opens up new avenues for the future of software, a bening use of AI that isn't harmful towards developers but another tool on our shelfs, it instills a mindset to generate value contributions from both the theoretical and practical aspects, thereby offering a transformative perspective.

For those of you interested i leave the link to the Research and software development expressed in Ohad Asor's work.

Most of the time I have seen that graph algorithm is introduced using a pictorial representation as one shown in Figure #1 below. 

In actual implementation, I think each node stands for coordinates of a point and each edge is the shortest possible between two points. 

Do you think I'm thinking along the right lines? 

Are graph search algorithms the most important sub-category of graph algorithms? Could you please help me?

I am new to programing and I am confused about the following things. It would be really helpful to get some proper explanation. 

I am confused about the terminal, bash, enviroment, interpreter. All these things got mixed up somehow and it is hard to understand how these things are communication betweem themseleves. Firstl, I use Windows and VSCode. 

Why do I have to use a terminal? Why it is better to use terminal then just click on things?

What are shells? What is difference between C, Bash shell? Why use one over the other? What am I usimg for shells? Are shell and terminal same?  How is the terminal from VSCode connected to command prompt or windows terminal?  Command prompt is also terminal? 

Anaconda? I installed it but do not get it. Again, it is terminal. All these terminals look same but have different purpose or what? 

Enviroment? I create enviroment in terminals, so I can have differenet packeges to work on different project without mixing them up, I guess, correct me if I am wrong. I can create enviroment with every terminal or just with conda?

I have tried programming in the past but I am not very good at it, I can just do enough to get by. I am really wondering if it is even worth it to stick with CS or CIS since I know these classes will be extremely difficult to pass especially since I am an athlete at my school so I don't have a lot of time to work with everything I have with that.

3080,Need Guidance (Don’t know where to start),"We are given a string X that is composed of n characters. X is a corrupted version of a meaningful text, in which all spaces are deleted and some of the characters are replaced with other characters. We would like to insert spaces into appropriate places in X so that the total number of characters in meaningless words is minimized. We are not interested in correcting the meaningless words.
Example:
• Input: X = allworkzkdnoplaymakesjackjdullbiy where n = 33.
• Output: “all work zkd no play makes jack j dull biy” is an optimal solution with a cost of 3 + 1 + 3 = 7, since all words except zkd, j, and biy are meaningful in this solution.
We are also given a procedure IsWord(w), which returns true if a string w is meaningful and false otherwise. Assume that IsWord works in Θ(1) time regardless of the length of w.
Develop an efficient dynamic programming solution to solve this problem by following these steps: 1. Identify the “last” decision we need to make.
2. Define subproblems, i.e., describe the table you need to compute.
3. Develop a recursive formulation to compute the entries of the table.
4. Explain how you would reconstruct the optimal solution based on the computed table. 5. Run through an example to show how your algorithm works.
6. Prove the correctness of your algorithm.
7. Analyze the runtime of your algorithm assuming bottom-up computation of the table.

3085,Tips on catching up while having understanding + how to avoid falling behind in the future ?,"Hi there. I'm in my fourth week of semester 1 year one of my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.
I had ultimately fallen behind and I have made attempts to catch up. They were semi-sucessful because I nearly caught up, but my core understanding of the papers was subpar. At this point in time a lot of our assignments are due so I have to put what I know to practice.

The three papers being introduction to python programming, discrete maths, and this other one paper about bit conversion, hexadecimals, logic gates, and the programming language assembly

The thing is they move so damn fast I don't have enough time to go over and understand the content and get the necessary help I need because by the next week they will have moved on.

I can only hope that after these assignments are due, the gap between them and the next ones will allow for a proper catch-up WITH understanding but my grade will take a medium size hit if I can at least manage with 50% on these assignments.

3113,How does Anticheat implementation in Games work?,"I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm really curious about how Game Anticheats like BattleEye or EasyAnticheat are integrated into games. 

I'm curious since there are games, using the same Anticheat, but with vastly different results. 

For example, the game ""Planetside 2"" has the BattleEye Anticheat, however it seems to have a major issue with cheaters running rampant right now. While the Anticheat seems to not work at all and the devs literally ban each Hacker manually by hand, ""Rainbow 6 Siege"" has the same Anticheat, but handles those hackers much more effectively, or at least detects and bans them automatically. 

Therefore I'm wondering why is there such a difference with the same Anticheat? 

How does the Anticheat Implementation work? Is the dev team of the game responsible to improve the Anticheat, or is that the responsibility of the Anticheat BattleEye Team? 

Has the anticheat something like an API where the game devs have to implement the anticheat components into the game, and depending on how much work they are willing to put into it, the anticheat works better with the game or not?",1711103536,379496,Revolutionary_Mine29,t2_7nc1w5m6,eb5997eae85506cdb1e2a7a4f228f7db4caf26985c639528d51d07bc8f31bd67,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bkw3gq/how_does_anticheat_implementation_in_games_work/
3114,Feeling discouraged,"some background first:

* graduated with BFA graphic design in 2004
* stuck with the industry until about 2010 when I ended up working at a private industrial design company that ended up having to let me go because of lack of business
* ended up switching to water treatment just for some job security and was there for 8 years
* went back to school to learn CAD and solid modeling (Autodesk Inventor)
* (2021) Got hired at a local fabrication/machine shop as a designer/drafter but was let go after a year. Learning their world proved to be difficult and they weren't prepared to train me. It was an exciting job opportunity, but I couldn't (and wasn't allowed) to develop my CAD skills.
* (2022) Got hired as a remote employee/trainee for Carter Lumber as a compnent designer and was fired after 6 months. Management was doing odd things, I asked too many questions and was assumed to be attempting to take over the group somehow. I was not allowed to speak and defend myself  when I was fired over the phone.

now:

* Currently in Frostburg State University online computer science master's program, completing the entire thing in one year so that I can get back to work. Bad idea.
* The online classes are very poor quality, some without lectures, and most just reading textbooks and journal articles.
* Lots of team projects with lost students of varying experience.
* Modules consist of links to online resources.
* Just super frustrated that learning methodology is just pointing us to online tutorials.
* I know CS is not just programming, but there has been just one non-team project where I could apply programming skills. Although one team project went so badly I just did the whole thing myself to cover my ass.
* I'm right now learning a lot in advanced software engineering and will have two web dev courses in the summer with the same instructor, but honestly this is obviously the meat of the program and I will not be coming away with much else after the program is over. Employers probably won't care I have this master's degree.

It's been a hard road to here with lots of points of promise and opportunity that just end in disaster.",1711116269,379498,Jfonzy,t2_pvws6,5c99c27792fa4d95367b01710a934f6cdd627b730cef135914dd3c334e81cadc,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bl018v/feeling_discouraged/

My main question, can I use whatever they have deposited on GitHub to create my own ""orb"" to verify myself using either my PC camera or phone camera? Do I need any hardware? Can I use minicomputers such as Rasberry Pie to get the job done?

3121,What should I be focusing on in my personal projects? ,"Hey guys I’m nearing the end of my sophomore year in cs and just started getting into personal projects, way too late I know, but I’m grinding now for an internship next summer. I made a personal portfolio website, a discord bot I’m working on, and some scripts for some software I use at my current job to automate some of my redundant tasks. I’m really struggling with the coding part to these as they all required new frameworks, languages, apis and I feel like I’m not coding. It feels like it would be impossible to memorize all these things and apply them on my own. It’s more like I’m using documentation to put blocks of code together and make everything work with eachother and of course I’m learning the code as I go a little bit but not enough to just sit down and code it myself. The only coding I do myself is in my DSA class which is just like making data structure programs from scratch and leetcode. I guess my main question is am I supposed to focus on the coding or the overall project like architecture when trying to learn from new projects?

This is why the Muslim girls at my school they always laugh and point at me because the girl I liked told them ""look her posted this on reddit hehehe"".

3135,Amortized Analysis of data structure ,"Hi, I really need help with this exercise because I don’t really understand what I should do. 

Professor Hirnriss has invented a new data structure! It consists of two arrays: a constantly sorted array § with space for m elements, and an unsorted array H, called the Hotlist: When the sorted array can hold m elements, the Hotlist can hold [sqrt(m)] elements. Initially, m = 9, so the Hotlist can hold 3 elements. The total number of elements in the data structure is n, initially n = 0.

Two operations are supported:

• Contains (7):

It is checked using binary search whether the sorted array contains x. If so, true is returned. Otherwise, a linear search is performed to check if the Hotlist contains the element, and true or false is returned accordingly.

• Insert(x):

If n ≤ 8, x is added to the sorted array and it is re-sorted with MergeSort. If n ≥ 9:

If there is still space in the Hotlist, the element is added to the end of the Hotlist.

Otherwise, allocate a new array of size m' = m + [sqrt(m)]. Sort the Hotlist with MergeSort and merge it with the sorted array as in the merge step of MergeSort. Now allocate a new Hotlist of size sqrt(m') (rounded upwards) and insert x into the Hotlist.

Show that both operations have an amortized cost of O(sqrt(n)). You can use the accounting or potential method. For n >= 9, the sorted array is always full.",1711185836,379606,curlyhead_2,t2_iob11p6m,fd74f6390ca70896607429c11c3cce07b64868004dbe7b153bf5e145d2fdd6dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1blo40s/amortized_analysis_of_data_structure/

3149,Blocked ,"PLEASE HELP - desperate student 

I have had my same Hotmail account since I was a kid. Everything is linked to it (my current thesis research work included!). I have been locked out due to suspicious activity.

I had two options, verity my account by using my secondary email linked to the account or else fill out the regain/verify form.

Unfortunately because my email is SO old, my back up email linked to the account was my old high schools email, which now no longer exists, so I had to take the 2nd option.

Here comes the tricky part. I grew up in Ireland and Scotland, spent 50% of my time in either country. The security questions are 
Where was this account set up (I can’t remember if 11 year old me picked Ireland or U.K.)

The other security question is name of childhood best friend. I know the answer to this. However it is an Irish name, so I’m not sure if I spelt her name the English way, or the Irish way with the special markings on the letters (eg. á) 

Anyways, I have tried all options and they won’t work. And of course my account has now been Blocked. 

I really need to tag in this email address. I can’t find a way to contact Microsoft, can’t find any phone number to call or an online chat line.

To make matters worse I currently study abroad in Hungary, and there isn’t any Microsoft place I can go to for help. 

Please please please if anyone could help me o would really appreciate it.

3171,Time Management Tips,"As someone new to computer science and programming, I'm really excited to learn and build projects, but I have a tendency to be an overachiever which often leads to burnout. I want to get better at balancing my time effectively between coding, assignments, personal projects, and life in general. 

For those more experienced programmers, computer science, and/or data professionals - what time management methods or techniques do you utilize to stay productive while avoiding burnout? 

I've heard of approaches like:

\- Pomodoro Technique (working in timed intervals with breaks)

\- Time Blocking (dedicating specific time slots for tasks)

\- Eisenhower Matrix (prioritizing by importance/urgency) 

\- 80/20 Rule (focusing on highest impact 20% of tasks)

\- Batching similar tasks together

But I'm really curious to hear what has worked well for you in this demanding field. Do you use any particular apps, tools or strategies to manage your coding workload alongside other responsibilities?

As a newbie, I want to develop good habits early on for sustainable productivity without burning myself out. I'd really appreciate any insights or tips you're willing to share on how you effectively manage your time with programming projects and assignments.

I knew there had to be a better way to develop in 2024.  By meta-tagging algorithms with the type of their inputs and outputs, we obtain a machine-understandable description of how to run them.  In the process of adding these tags, we can also index the algorithms by keyword for easy searching later.  With a little bit of theoretical computer science, this tagging also allows us to quickly find the sequence of algorithms required for a larger process.

Fundamentally, these tags are types and the algorithms serve as casts.

Ontolog is a programming language I'm developing that treats all computations as typecasts.  This change in perspective large solves the above problems.  For a more philosophical tutorial/demo, check out [ontolog.dev](http://ontolog.dev).

Beyond the language, Ontolog will be an open-source no-code interface developers to distribute their algorithms to nontechnical consumers.  Ontolog is platform-independent, config-free, fast, and great for orchestrating large processes.

Possible use cases include:

* Scientific computing
* 3D Design
* Report/document automation
* Smart home automation

3181,How to promote open-source software?,"Hello!

First post here. I'm fresh out of graduating from college with a bachelor's in computer science. I'm trying to build a portfolio for my resume. I've been spending many months in my free time developing a software that enables Windows users to change display modes with hot keys. I'm finally almost done with the initial implementation, and I plan on making it public on GitHub.

How can I let people know that it exists so I can get feedback on it?",1711308790,379776,jonRock1992,t2_8r7vx74x,3874f150ac5b138a1cbea388d71d84d6a82c246a6002f392599f3910bb60d9fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bmt7sl/how_to_promote_opensource_software/
3182,Different between CTRL+Z and backspace when editing a document,"When we are editing a text file, and it's currently saved, there is no option to save it. If we type anything, we see an option to save, but if we undo it by doing CTRL+Z, the option to save goes away.

However, if we type something and backspace it, the option to save remains. The editing program doesn't recognize that the file is back in it's last saved state

Why is that? My guess is that there is some stack of keystrokes associated with each state of a document

For example, if we type ABCD and press save, the stack is **\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**. If we type E, then the stack appends an \[E\] and becomes **\[E\]\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**. When we press CTRL+Z, the stack goes back to being **\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**, just like the saved document

However, if the document is saved with the stack **\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**, and we type E and then backspace the E, the stack is **NOT** **\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**, rather it is: **\[BACKSPACE\]\[E\]\[D\]\[C\]\[B\]\[A\]**

Is my guess correct?",1711311580,379780,aspiringgamecoder,t2_uei98eaej,f784d31d728a42ecd4d1527b26b7c91c93fd2243f7e798fd0681e5dffdb929bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bmucvb/different_between_ctrlz_and_backspace_when/

3199,"With the rise of AI, is computer science still a viable option?","Hi everyone :)
So I'm 18, I love math, and I'm great with computers, so these last few years I've been planning on studying Computer Science at uni. My thought process (aside from comp sci being something I'm passionate about) was always something along the lines of: with technology becoming so central to life, getting into the industry and being able to help develop these processes will be a career that remains relevant and necessary for a long time. Financially rewarding too, I hope. But I'm also thinking how now AI can code those processes. Maybe I could help create the AI that codes those processes? But there could be AI that codes the processes that code the processes! Do you see my dilemma here? Are my concerns valid? 
My only other fear with computer science is that I won't be able to land myself a job that helps make the world a better place. I have no doubt that computer science contributes to the bettering of the world - my anxiety lies in whether or not I will land up contributing to said bettering of the world. Do any of you guys have a story to share about how you used/use computer science in that way?
I live in South Africa, but I'm not sure I'll always live here, for reference.
I think you guys are super cool. Thanks for doing what you do! I hope to be like you one day.

I'm thinking about creating personal projects to help reinforce this and explore different areas of CS to find where my passions & strengths are - simultaneously they can serve as a portfolio of sorts when job hunting in the future, which is always an added plus.

Has anyone else done this? Where I'm stuck at is the 'what'. What could these projects be? and what signifies a project as being a good test into a subject that hits the different stages of the process in a working environment?

&#x200B;

>Let A be a large collection of n elements; so large that it cannot be stored entirely in main memory and must be stored on disk. One way to sort such a set is to design a variant of the merge sort algorithm: divide the set A into k smaller sets A1, A2, ⋯, Ak, sort each of those sets recursively. Then merge all the sorted sets together to form the original sorted set.  
>  
>  
>  
> a)Suppose the size of each disk is b and the size of main memory is m. Explain with an example what value k (in terms of b and m) should be in order to merge k sorted sets with O(n/b) disk transfer operations (reading a page from disk or writing a page to disk).  
>  
>  
>  
>b) Prove that the merge sort algorithm sorts the set A with O((n/b)(log n/b)/( log m/b )) disk transfers by formulating and solving a recursive relation for the number of disk transfers.

I am walking towards a master's degree on computer science and the idea is to document some of my learnings on my blog. The first article is a 101 introduction on one of my favorite areas (and the one that I want to pursue the master's on), Distributed Systems. Feel free to take a look at it! 

&#x200B;

Any feedbacks are much appreciated.

I just dont understand how we make advancements in graphics cards and technology when its all just metal and components. How do companies make technological strives in technology do they just intricately add more metal parts that interact with each other in better ways like new graphics cards and iphone chips? Whenever someone attempts to explain it it just never satisfies my need to know as realistically a lot of the terms like “data” they use arent tangibly applicable in the way i need it explained.

3263,IA and graduate course,"Guys, I've come up with a long-term project that will probably take about 10 to 15 years to reach where I want it to be. It's an AI predictive model for geographical data in general.

For those who work or study in the field, how is the choice of a programming language and the planning of an AI made? Given that this project is extremely long-term, I'm willing to learn any new technology.

My second question is: as I mentioned, the project is quite extensive. I'm currently in my undergraduate studies in Information Systems, and due to the scale of the project, I could include it in my undergraduate thesis, master's, and even doctoral studies. Although I prefer to drive this project alone, it's practically impossible, as at some point I'll need significant computing power. The issue is that I would like to monetize this project, as it has a wide range of potential clients and there is no similar solution in the current market, nor any rumors of something similar. After completing my doctorate, can I use this project to start my own company? Or does it become public domain because it was developed in an academic environment?

I already know about the math part, and i'm gonna search more about it later for my own.

1-idx vs 0-idx seems to be an odd choice, given it has impacts on edge cases. 

The use of “i”,”j”,”k” … etc i really struggle with. It’s fine if eg there’s just a single variable, i, which is semantically used as an iterator variable. But eg I was looking through my prof’s pseudocode for QuickSort, and they use “k” and “l” for the left and right pointers during the pivot algorithm. 

The point of pseudocode (as i understand) is to abstract away the particulars of a machine, and focus on the steps. But this adds more confusion for me, preventing focus. Eg, setting a pointer that is inherently on the Right to lowercase “l” (which is already difficult to differentiate from 1 or uppercase I) seems convoluted, particularly when you ALSO have a Left pointer called something else!",1711541486,380063,chillingfox123,t2_4ao88gr7,924b47fe34e94f74b482d78f679a20dbcac212ff8274ff0bee282ebb7235dfcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bp0boc/in_formal_academic_algorithmic_pseudocode_why/

3298,"At the Crossroads of Data Careers: Engineers, Scientists, Analysts - What Sets Them Apart?","Hey, fellow enthusiasts! 🚀

I'm in my first year of diving deep into the data science world, and it's been a whirlwind of excitement, challenges, and, honestly, a bit of confusion. Every day, I'm bombarded with new terms, tools, and techniques. It's like standing at the crossroads of a vast city, trying to figure out which path leads where.

Here I am, a 19-21-year-old guy, trying to make sense of where I fit in this data universe. The roles of Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analysts seem to blur yet stand distinct. They're like different characters in a movie, each with their own set of tools and missions. But what exactly makes them different? What tools do they swear by in their day-to-day quests to conquer data challenges?

1. **Data Engineers**: I've heard they're the builders, setting the stage for data magic to happen. But beyond the buzzwords like Hadoop and Spark, what tools are truly essential in their arsenal?

2. **Data Scientists**: These seem to be the wizards, conjuring insights and predictions from raw data. Python and R are often mentioned, but what about the other spells in their spellbook?

3. **Data Analysts**: The detectives of the data world, turning data into stories and decisions. Excel is a classic, but in the age of big data, there must be more to their toolkit, right?

As I stand here, at the beginning of my data science journey, I'm reaching out to you, the experienced adventurers of this realm. Your wisdom could light up the path for me and many others just starting out. What tools do these roles really use? How do they differ in their approaches and missions?

3314,What undergraduate college education would be best for the career I want?,"I recently became fascinated with AI and machine learning. I am transferring into economics in the fall after a little bit of community college, and I'm wondering, what's the best degrees and internships I can get in college for what I want to do as a career?

What I want to do as a career:
I want to use machine learning and AI to formulate and solve economic problems. This is starting to be done very experimentally. Treat the economy like a game and have the program run it a thousand times to attempt to predict the future of current economic trends and policy.

To my understanding, our understanding of economics is chaotic, but more advanced than our current progression in AI. In order for this to be possible, we need advances in AI, not economics.

My school has plenty of co op and internship opportunities. Majors and minors in CS and Econ

My real dilemma is do I want to be a computer scientist who understands econ? Or an economist who understands comp sci?

I just really don't know what to do. I think working on machine learning through comp sci would unlock this technology better, but you would have to understand economics well to utilize it properly. Is a Comp Sci degree and Econ degree good together and worth the time and effort? Or would statistics be better? Where should I look for internships for good experience? I just don't know much about the field 

Thanks for reading this. I'd love to hear anything. I don't know much about how any of this works, I'm very new to it, and want to hear anything you have to say.

3320,Is there technique to compute the distance between two nodes (data base entries) in a pseudo tree structure?,"Sorry for the confusing post title but I don't really no better how to phrase it. I'm not looking for an algorithm per se but just a way to store my entries such that I can quickly get a depth or distance between two nodes.

Specifically:

Do you know Infinite Craft? If not, just go on check it out here, you should be able to understand it right away: [https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/)

So I'm working on a clone of Infinite Craft that supports multiplayer and that has also goals. I.e., there will be a random goal word and the player who manages to generate that goal word first wins. We wanted to add a little real-life ranking that shows what words players generated so far and blurr words that the current player did not generate themselves yet. I had the idea of ordering this ranking table according to the words that are the 'closest to the target word'.

The dat base where the words are stored will have a table with this kind of schema:

CombinationTable(Word1, Word2, ResultWord)

Now I wondered, if it is possible to store some kind of value that reveals for example how far the first the first ResultWord you get is from the GoalWord in this table, i.e., how many combinations would be necessary to get there.

Example:

Fire + Water = Steam

Steam + Wind = Cloud

Cloud + Earth = Rain

So Fire and Water are both 2 (or 3) units away from Rain. 

Is there a known way to get this value? Either by storing additional data in the table entries or maybe using an algorithm? The fun part of Infinite Craft is that entries that are not known, will be automatically added to the table by forwarding the client's combination to an LLM, getting a result, updating the table and returning the result from the Client, so the User can play 'forever' in Infinite Craft and in our version, this is a random chance of getting the goal word despite being far away from it based on the current table by just being lucky with the LLM.

Since there would be multiple paths that would lead to the current word, I guess I'd always like to have the fastest distance from Initial Word to GoalWord.

I assume there must be a technique for this out there since technically speaking, you could depict the table entries as a pseudo tree, where two nodes give you a new node which is then used for another new node and so on. In this specific case, it'd be a tree with 4 roots. If it's not a tree, it could be definitely depicted as a graph though.

3352,How do you evaluate Big-Oh with variables not related to the number of inputs?,"Let me clarify first, I don't mean constants. Constants get ignored, I know that much.

But what about variables associated with the input that aren't length?

Take this code for example:

    randomList = [1, 6, 2, 7, 13, 9, 4]
    def stupid(inList):                         #O(n) * O(C) = O(n)
        for i in range(len(inList)):            #O(n)
            for x in range(500):                #O(C)
                x = x + i
    
    
    def SelectionSort(inList):                  #O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)
        inList = list(inList)
        for i in range(len(inList)):            #O(n)
            mIndex = i
            for j in range(i+1, len(inList)):   #O(n)
                if inList[j] < inList[mIndex]:
                    mIndex = j          
            temp = inList[i]
            inList[i] = inList[mIndex]
            inList[mIndex] = temp
    
        return inList
    
    # Modified Selection Sort
    def ValSort(inList):                        #O(2n) + O(k) * O(n) = .....O(n) ?
        inList = list(inList)
        maxVal = 0
        minVal = inList[0]
    
        #Find the minimum element, and the maximum element
        for i in range(len(inList)):            #O(2n)
            if inList[i] > maxVal:
                maxVal = inList[i]
            if inList[1] < minVal:
                minVal = inList[1]
        
        k = maxVal - minVal
        setIndex = 0
    
        #Loop through all possible elements, and put them in place if found.
        for a in range(k):                      #O(k)   ?
            a = minVal + a
            for i in range(len(inList)):        #O(n)  
                if inList[i] == a:
                    temp = inList[setIndex]
                    inList[setIndex] = inList[i]
                    inList[i] = temp
                    setIndex += 1
                    break
        
        return inList
    
    
    print(SelectionSort(randomList))            #[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13]
    print(ValSort(randomList))                  #[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13]

This does come with the condition that the list you want to sort must be entirely unique, no two elements can be the same, otherwise my ValSort just doesn't work. But that condition doesn't change the Big-Oh of Selection sort, so it should be perfectly valid still.

&#x200B;

So let me explain my hypothesis here. 

Selection sort loops through the indicies ( `O(n)` ), and compares the current value to all other elements (`O(n)`). You're doing O(n), O(n) times, and as such the Big-Oh of the entire function is O(n\^2)

ValSort, loops through all elements, and does 2 comparisons to find the maximum and the minimum of the list ( `O(2n) = O(n)` ), and then loops through the difference instead (`O(k)`), looping through the entire list every time it does that (`O(n)`), and as such the Big-Oh of the entire function is O(n) + O(k) \* O(n) = O(n) .... ?

&#x200B;

This is what I'm asking. Obviously this algorithm is awful, as 90% of the time you're looping through the list for literally no reason. But if I evaluate ""k"" as a constant (`O(C)`), then by the conventions of Big-Oh I simply just drop it, leaving me with O(n) + O(n), or O(2n) = O(n)

So, As the title suggests. How do you evaluate Big-Oh with variables not related to the number of inputs? Clearly there is something I don't know going on here. 

Unless I've just found the best sorting algorithm and I just don't know it yet.

3364,The British Library's analysis of the ransomware attack they suffered in October,"[https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf](https://www.bl.uk/home/british-library-cyber-incident-review-8-march-2024.pdf)

It's unusual for an organisation to publish this sort of analysis.  There are a couple of things that I thought were interesting lessons that are probably applicable to a very wide selection of organisation.

The first is about their attitude to risk.  They were good at identifying large risks that were too big to carry (""out-of-appetite risks"") and getting something done to mitigate them.  But no-one had an overview of all the little risks they were carrying and how those added up to a large degree of risk in the aggregate.  It seems to me likely that this is true of many other organisations that are staffed with good, competent people; individuals assess risks and make sound judgements about whether those risks *on their own* are worth doing something about.  But they don't have any mechanism for assessing the overall level of risk being carried by the organisation because risks that individuals judge too small to bother doing anything about aren't reported anywhere.

And, secondly, their recovery has been severely hampered by their inability to reinstall many systems because they are obsolete.  In many cases, they have recovered their data from off-site backups or external sources but are unable to put it back online because the software vendor no longer supports the software or has gone out of business entirely; even where they have managed to hold on to a copy of the installer, often it won't run on a modern operating system that complies with their upgraded security requirements.  This, again, is probably true of a number of organisations; how many of you have systems still running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS because that what was installed and it's always worked?  Would you be able to recover those systems if they were destroyed?  You can't install 12.04 from scratch; Ubuntu have deleted it from their archive (at least their public archive).",1711719023,380356,Conscious-Ball8373,t2_4ti8x4fr,06fcd5ab03f956f648b480af8e549e5938dfa58343396b84188578c9720de5c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bqpcdd/the_british_librarys_analysis_of_the_ransomware/

3366,Confused about the Connected-Components algorithm in CLRS: why is this algorithm even necessary?,"I am reading [CLRS, page 562 - 564 (pdf page 583 - 585)](https://pd.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/course/material/book-430/pdf_content), and it provides the following algorithm:

    CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G):
         for each vertex v ∈ G.V
              MAKE-SET(v)
         for each edge (u, v) ∈ G.E
              if FIND-SET(u) != FIND-SET(v)
                   UNION(u,v)

CLRS then states, `""In the actual implementation of this [...] algorithm, the representations of the graph and the disjoint-set data structure would need to reference each other. That is, an object representing a vertex would contain a pointer to the corresponding disjoint-set object, and vice versa. These programming details depend on the implementation language, and we do not address them further here.""`

I understand how this algorithm works; I am just confused why this is even necessary. 

As I understand it, a graph is a visual tool and you can represent this graph in many ways in an actual computer: a matrix, a list, etc. **But, by virtue of creating the representation of the graph in the computer, wouldn't the connections be delineated too?!** 

Is this about *converting* these data structures into a *set* so that you can simply see *what* is connected, and not necessarily their *specific* connections?

Given two regular languages L1 and L2 over alphabet Σ, we define the operator RQ(L1, L2) = {w | there exists a word v in L2 such that wv is in L1}. The task is to determine the smallest language class among Regular, LL, CFG, and DCFG that certainly contains RQ(L1, L2).

So, I started with the most restricted of the languages I mentioned, which is Regular. But the problem is that I don't really have a formal or actual definition of RQ, or L1 and L2 for that matter. The only thing I know is that L1 & L2 are regular and then I know the definition of RQ. So, how can I use the pumping lemma or DFA without the expression for RQ to for example prove or disprove that it is a regular language? I am drawing like boxes of models for DFA like in here:

3397,Dynamic Graphs wtih Pygame - A Python Library by C.Botos," 

This is the first ever python library/package I have published. Please feel free to contact me if you have any recommendations or observe any bugs.

A video of what this library can do: [https://youtu.be/Xpg7Ib81FYU](https://youtu.be/Xpg7Ib81FYU)

This library is essentially an easy and really fast way to depict 2d graphs whose x and y values are dynamically changing.

It utilizes the popular python library “pygame”, which is a package used to draw objects on a screen.

You can easily **install** it using pip by executing the command “**pip install dynamic\_graphs\_with\_pygame**”. The library also depends on the python libraries “numpy” and “pygame” which you can also easily install using pip: “pip install numpy” and “pip install pygame” respectively. You may also clone it right away from this project’s GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ChrisBotos/Dynamic\_Graphs\_with\_Pygame](https://github.com/ChrisBotos/Dynamic_Graphs_with_Pygame) . Here is the package’s page on PyPi as well: [https://pypi.org/project/dynamic-graphs-with-pygame/](https://pypi.org/project/dynamic-graphs-with-pygame/) .

I strongly recommend **visiting the GitHub** repository anyway and running the file named “example\_usage.py” as well as reading the README for better understanding of how to use this library. Reading the comments in the code is also useful for further clarity.

Not all backdoors are created the same, some are more complex than others but in general I'm wondering if the lock the door when they aren't using it and if even they do, wouldn't it be possible to wait until the hackers machine is being accessed from the other machine to then send that package while the door is in use?

3450,What is the best practice book for computational problem solving?,"The core of computer science is computational problem solving. Computer scientists often get stuck and spend a lot of time trying to  wrap their head around how to continue writing some software.   

The core of computational problem solving involves creating a  problem representation that captures key information about the problem,  and designing an algorithm that solves the problem using its  representation. This works for simple problems. Complex problems at  work, during our career, have to be reduced to simpler sub-problems that  we know how to solve, abstracted to their key information, decomposed  into modules and subroutines that encapsulate the features, and so on.  That's where a computational thinking book comes handy because it  describes many different ways to solve a complex computational problem  efficiently.   

This book has taught me a lot after many years of my career:   

[https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Thinking-Karl-Beecher/dp/1780173644](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Thinking-Karl-Beecher/dp/1780173644) 

Do you know any more comprehensive book for computational problem  solving? I want to know the best practice in 2024 and use it as a  comprehensive reference book when solving a complex computational  problem. The goal is to solve complex problems faster by applying  methods from the book instead of only intuition.

3474,you aren’t using crypto right,"is there actual project that’s revolutionizing the market? most projects utility serves no real world value.

1. main reason why retail investor buy crypto is because of its attractive staking apy they offer.  if you took at “Ethereum” what retail would call “blue chip” crypto. they are famous for “POS” consensus meaning you could “stake/pool” your ethereum, to be paided back more eth. reason because you help “validate” the new blocks proposed by others. however this model is so unpredictable because you are relying on the masses to hold, stake and repeat. someone could just be offline or be greedy and slash the network for everyone, making eth vulnerable.

2. “layer 2” solutions L2. let’s say you want to send your buddy $20 with crypto. you wouldn’t want to send them an old L1 token like Ethereum due its slow transaction speed and high gas fee. you would send them a new L2 token like polygon, arbitrum etc.. where there transaction fee are close to 0 and instant transaction. reason why these L2 tokens could provide this is bec user are not congesting the main network allowing transaction to run smoothly. when more users buy in and the project scales, it will face the same issue of network congestion making the crypto slower and pricy to send. so will the new solution be Layer 3 token? what next Layer 4 and 5?

3. “play2earn” if it’s not ai, its p2e is the buzz word that hypes retail crazy. the only practical way i see crypto and nfts being integrated is within gaming. yes i guess you could sell your tickets as nfts to ur show as an upcoming soundcloud rapper, sell some course as influencer or whatever, but gaming is where this tech makes sense. however, i’m tired of seeing games that look like “hayday” where u farm crypto. Card games where you trade nft. wtf is this not exciting. i want to see some mmo/fps/tps or any other action games where players will be rewarded playing the game. i know some triple A studio went in this market but most quit half way through or the rest are just not out yet. p2e concept sounds amazing but realistically i haven’t seen anyone perfect it where it would be approved by retail. not only it would be hectic to maintain the dedicated online servers, the storage problems facing with billions of microtransaction playing p2e games. i haven’t seen a single company to perfect this. Has anyone played a decent p2e game? 

no means i’m trying to discourage crypto. im a developer currently creating my own ideal infrastructure and a hodler for a long time and i will still continue to hold bec lol. however, last couple of years ive been very displeased with the community because i feel as most of these projects are very repetitive or others exit liquidity. please let know what you want to see in future web3 projects and what you hate seeing. this would be so helpful to my ongoing project. <3",1712019125,380808,glitching_rogue,t2_kjcu97ep,600acb134214473c535666bc7e51a9360bcd334573f474c68491a3515a9c97b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1btlcb1/you_arent_using_crypto_right/

3477,Question about what path I should take,"Hello, I am about to graduate with my associates in computer science. I am confused on where I should go after, should I go and get a bachelors and spend 40,000 more dollars or should I do a coding bootcamp for $9,000? I feel there is pros and cons to both and I know from what I’ve heard that the job market is is very saturated and don’t really know what path would be better, I feel like bootcamp might be better because it would only be a year and be way less expensive but I also don’t know what jobs are looking for right now. I would love to get an opinion from someone who is at a job right now and how they got in and what I should do. I am just very lost because I have heard so many different things from diffident people.

3527,Switching to Tech?,"

I've been mulling over a career switch lately, and am eyeing the Tech industry. Obviously not the easiest time with all the competition and the recent job market slump. The main reason for this want of transition is I wanna know how to build and develop products and earn a good buck while in it.

About me: I've a background in humanities, but I was good at math, so I've kept in touch with it. I know the basics about the tech stacks used in the industry, the terminologies and a good familiarity with algorithms and data structures but haven't really built anything practical yet.

So, where do I start? What's the roadmap here? Which tech stack or framework should I focus on to catch employers' eyes? And what's the deal with the hiring process, given my non-tech background?

Throughout my journey in computer science, I've found myself drifting without a clear focus within my major. I've simply studied what was provided to me without actively expanding my knowledge or exploring my strengths. Upon graduation, I stumbled upon the field of data science and recognized its potential relevance to my interests. However, despite my eagerness to learn, I've faced rejection or missed opportunities whenever I've attempted to enroll in internships or bootcamps to further my education in this area.

On the other hand, I found success in software testing and even earned a scholarship for it. Yet, despite this achievement, I struggle to feel confident in my abilities within this field. I find myself questioning my capabilities and worrying about the future. Although I have some experience in software engineering and believe I excel in UI development, I still lack the confidence to fully embrace these skills.

Is it normal to feel this way?",1712195235,381300,dilll_1,t2_6ck20gsn,4b563dd0aea80471b3e7e8acd7de7c621f11d27f441053b49271bb89f1f99ced,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bvb17v/am_i_cooked/

Course website:** [**https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/)

Interested in Transformers, the deep learning model that has taken the world by storm? Want to have intimate discussions with researchers? If so, this course is for you! It's not every day that you get to personally hear from and chat with the authors of the papers you read!

Each week, we invite folks at the forefront of Transformers research to discuss the latest breakthroughs, from LLM architectures like GPT and Gemini to creative use cases in generating art (e.g. DALL-E and Sora), biology and neuroscience applications, robotics, and so forth!

CS25 has become one of Stanford's hottest and most exciting seminar courses. We invite the coolest speakers such as Andrej Karpathy, Geoffrey Hinton, Jim Fan, Ashish Vaswani, and folks from OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA, etc. Our class has an incredibly popular reception within and outside Stanford, and around 1 million total views on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM). Our class with Andrej Karpathy was the second most popular [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfpMkf4rD6E&ab_channel=StanfordOnline) uploaded by Stanford in 2023 with over 500k views!

We have significant improvements for Spring 2024, including a large lecture hall, professional recording and livestreaming (to the public), social events, and potential 1-on-1 networking! The only homework for students is weekly attendance to the talks/lectures. Also, livestreaming and auditing are available to all. Feel free to audit in-person or by joining the [Zoom livestream](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/99922151759?pwd=dW5CcUtVYkNybGZGY0hMWUZtVkZBZz09).

We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2vE7gbsjzA) (over 1500 members) used for Transformers discussion. We open it to the public as more of a ""Transformers community"". Feel free to join and chat with hundreds of others about Transformers!

P.S. Yes talks will be recorded!

3557,How can I write a compiler to compile to another language instead of machine code?,"So I’m a physics undergrad and last year I started learning FORTRAN. However, I’ve been programming for a few years as a hobby and I hate FORTRAN’s syntax cause it’s so different from the programming languages I’m used to.
However, FORTRAN is blazingly fast doing computations and the speed is really essential for me.
I started learning Rust a while back and I got the idea to make my own language, so that it has a syntax that is easier, and I can “fix” some things I don’t like about FORTRAN like making defining matrices easier to write; maybe even combine FORTRAN and Python in it so that I can get the blanzingly fast computations from FORTRAN and the pretty graphs from python without sacrificing speed.
The project I started uses Regex to format my custom syntax, look for the things the user defined and write them in FORTRAN. As far as I’ve gotten this way, even though it’s actually working well, I’m afraid that once I start adding even MORE features, the Regex will become really slow and “compiling the code” would take very long, which is against the purpose; plus having an actual compiler checking everything in my custom language would be nice.
I heard about Gleam recently and saw that it can compile down to JS, and I wondered if I can do something similar. However, I’ve tried to find resources online but can find any.
Does anybody know what could I do to write an actual compiler (preferibly in Rust) that can compile down to FORTRAN? I’d love to learn about this and hopefully make mine and others life easier!",1712268455,381475,okimusix,t2_cf1ljsp7,3b589c657c9df2f4c03de46feb5abbfa9435f66c90eec27f835fcfa5990b7a83,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bw0jbc/how_can_i_write_a_compiler_to_compile_to_another/

He decided to leave the field of music (discovered busboy work does not pay enough to cover food and shelter🥹, and return to his childhood love of computers. 

Son became certified in highly recommended computer programs, but they did not lead to job offers.

He’s returning home (Bay Area) from out of state, hoping for a degree from the UC system. He is also open to online schooling from reputable university.

Since son is currently tied up packing up apartment for his big move, I thought I would help by making a list of your best suggestions so he can hit the ground running once he arrives home.

3564,"Here is my take on the Halting problem, P vs. NP, and Quantum Supremacy","Outside of known and provable axioms in any formal system that may be true but must be consistently unprovable and thus unprovable must be consistently incomplete.

Godel's explanation suggests that because we cannot fully enumerate or prove all axioms or their consequences within powerful formal systems, leading to instances of truths that are inherently unprovable (incompleteness), this principle extends to the realm of algorithms, implying we cannot devise a single algorithm that infallibly determines whether any given program will halt.

All we can hope for is to define new axioms and perhaps quantitatively but more importantly qualitatively so.

With this I would say it is highly likely that we have speedups that are profoundly exponential and decidedly impacted by the type of quantum computing and quantum algorithms that are designed for an every increasingly capable system.

1000+ quantum supremacy. 5000+ perhaps P vs.NP. Of course, that is just a from the hip theory.

I don't think we have to think about it as solving P vs. NP but rather how much knowledge can we unlock from these knew found system capabilities.

Of course today's encryption would be obviously clipped along the way ;)",1712276858,381489,Xtianus21,t2_58rkqicv,2154203f0b8d0a6c4238ae2964d50b715d127375ea2516182966eb8716b1caac,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bw3yg9/here_is_my_take_on_the_halting_problem_p_vs_np/

3578,I don't get the Halting Problem,"As the title suggests, I don't understand the Halting problem. As far as I can tell I get what the problem is but I don't understand the proof.

From what I understand the Halting Problem asks whether or not a machine can be built that can determine whether an input machine halts or does not on a given input.

The proof I have seen for this is that no such machine can exist because you could build an additional machine that inverses the halts / does not halt state making the Halting detector always wrong.

I don't understand how this proves that the Halting detector can not exist. When we define the input for the Halting detector it is a machine and an input for that machine. In the proof The input of the Halting detector is it's own output. I don't see how that makes sense. Essentially we are given the Halting detector a machine and an input that is a machine... Etc.This recursion means that there is never a root input to the  Halting detector. There are infinitly nested machines but no initial input. I don't understand why this proof proves that Halting detectors can not exist and not something like that self referencing negators are unstable.

I fear that I have not adequately formulated my question so I am happy to supply clarification if what I am trying to say does not make sense.",1712295758,381544,LEGOmaker9,t2_9r9ix9xl,c1445154e46166271d929a751ff6e9102a8aa33846e8120e01f93e8ebaa0d481,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bwafrr/i_dont_get_the_halting_problem/

I'm pretty new to coding world, given that I only know some Python coding.  
As the title mentions, I would like to participate to Google's SOC, to get better in coding and to gain some experience. Only problem is that I've recently discovered Google SOC, and I have so many questions to ask about it:  


1) Do you reckon is too late now to start all the application process?  
2) Will my poor knowledge with coding make G 's SOC experience a ""suicide""?  
3) Have you got any advices to give me in order to increase my possibilities to be accepted to SOC?

And a private IP address is assigned by your router to each device within your network. Got that. But where and why do MAC addresses come in?? I know they are ALSO unique identifiers for your devices, but if so, why not just use those on the private side? Why have the router assign your devices another form of identifier in private IP addresses?",1712341549,381621,thespencman,t2_3zcd8op7,1c9d0eb26372813ec9bba0ebf701324eb5c8eae68f5bbc686117f2e788ec0e82,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1bwp8il/why_do_we_use_both_private_ip_addresses_and_mac/

3604,Is a bachelors or masters the better option for this situation ? ,"So I currently hold a bachelors in business. To just be dead honest , I half assed all my classes and truly learned nothing worth while nor made effort to attend career fairs/networking/internships. Yes my mistake and i regret it. 

I made the decision to go back to school for computer science. I spoke to an advisor at my local university and he told me that a masters would be the “best” option because i already have a bachelors and have credits that can go towards applying for masters program minus a few classes. (Trig,pre calc, calc 1 , programming 1 and 2). Plus he mentioned that masters would be faster and that having 2 bachelors may not be seen as positively as 1 bachelors 1 masters

I am currently taking the necessary classes at community college and now I’m starting to have second thoughts. 

Although i am passing my classes with As , the more “advanced” form of trig where algebraic principles are applied are becoming a challenge. As I’ve learned more about comp sci , there’s a lot of math involved. Programming fundamentals 1 and 2 cover quite a bit BUT I’m concerned that it won’t be sufficient to jump straight into a masters program right away. 

Same goes with Math , i can’t imagine just solely going from Calc 1 then straight into comp sci masters. 

Maybe I’m overthinking ? I could really use some input.

3618,"It is possible to phrase a ""numbo"" problem in terms of a virtual machine / bytecode program listing","It is possible to phrase the numbo problem (below) in terms of the existence of a bytecode program listing for the following specialized virtual machine:

The ROM consists of integer register, one for each number in the given list. These are made effectively ""single use"" in the following way: in RAM, there is a bit for each register called the *used* bit, and it is set when a ROM register is loaded into a general purpose register. Once the *used* bit has been set, any instruction attempting to load that register will fail with a ""single use register cannot be reloaded"" error. In other words, each ROM register is ""use once"" and the rule is enforced by the interpretation of bytecode instructions.

The general purpose registers have the property that

1. all instructions have distinct arguments (i.e. a register name may not be repeated in an instruction's arguments)

2. in RAM each general purpose register is associated with an *occupy* bit that indicates whether or not a valid algebraic value (always a whole number) is held in the register

3. each algebraic instruction must indicate an unoccupied result register to hold the calculated value, must indicate occupied registers as arguments

4. each algebraic instruction must set the occupied bit for the indicated result register, and clear the occupied bit for the indicated argument registers

There is a goal register (one of the general purpose registers) that must be equal to the target number for a bytecode program listing to produce a correct ""construction"" or ""solution"" to the numbo problem / challenge.

There are two types of bytecode instructions: load and calculate; a load instruction takes a ROM register and copies it to a general purpose register, and a calculate instruction is described above.

Theorem. There is a solution to a numbo problem (L,T) for an input list of number L and target number T if and only if there is a bytecode program listing for a virtual machine described above, parameterized with given (L,T), i.e. the items of L are the ROM registers and T is the target.

Proof. Left to reader as an exercise.

If it is possible to describe the state changes of a puzzle (not always easy for some puzzles that rely on complex 3D manipulation for solution) as discrete state changes, then the above method should apply.

Pretty neat, huh?

For reference, numbo is the problem: given a small list of numbers and permitted operations (usually addition, subtraction, multiplication, division resulting in whole numbers, and modulo) as well as a target number, plus the ability to group (parenthesis) is there a mathematical expression in which each number on the list occurs, and in the same multiplicity, that evaluates algebraically to the target number?

3625,Best way to  understand how a computers works?,"**Context:** I'm a data scientist working on some Large Language Model (LLM) applications, but I keep running into issues with computing (despite my proficiency in programming, my knowledge of computer hardware is limited). I'm trying to bridge my understanding of software and hardware with questions like:

- **Software vs Hardware dimension**: If an LLM model has 7 million parameters, how much RAM would I need? How do RAM and VRAM relate, and what impact do they have on computing? What about the differences between GPU and CPU? What are the minimum VRAM and RAM requirements to run 4 GPUs? How does a single-core GPU from one brand differ from a single-core GPU from another brand from a computing perspective?

- **Time dimension**: How much time would it take to process 7 million parameters on a CPU with 8 cores versus a GPU with 4 cores? Would having additional RAM or VRAM speed up the process, and if so, by how much given X amount of extra RAM and Y amount of extra VRAM?

- **Cost dimension**: What's the electricity consumption for processing 7 million parameters? Does it vary between using a CPU or a GPU? How can I calculate the total electricity usage given certain CPU/GPU computation?

As you can see, I'm seeking to understand the basics of how computers operate from an application perspective, without getting too immersed in theoretical details. My goal is to acquire enough knowledge to confidently address the questions mentioned above. So far, the resources I've found include:

- [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW0s7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye)

- [Google Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

- [Building an 8-bit breadboard computer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) (this might be too in-depth)

  
And some maybe too general:

3650,Making a parser,"So I am making parser for Turtle and I am kinda   trying to figure out how to solve a  quote balancing. 

  
So this is basically my BNF.

    <expr>  ::= <forward> | <backward> | <left> | <right> | <color> | <repeat>
    <forward>   ::= ""FORW"" <Decimal>
    <backward>  ::= ""BACK"" <Decimal>
    <left>      ::= ""LEFT"" <Decimal>
    <right>     ::= ""RIGHT"" <Decimal>
    <color>     ::= ""COLOR"" <Hex>
    <repeat>    ::= ""REP"" <Decimal> <Quote> <expt> <Quote> | ""REP"" <Decimal> <expr> | ""REP"" <Decimal> <expr>
    <Decimal>   ::= [0-9]+
    <Hex>       ::= [a-fA-F0-9]{6}
    <Quote>     ::= ""QUOTE""
    

My parser works fine and all but the only problem is the quotes. I always make sure that if we open a quote then we close them as well which is not that hard. But cases like these work as well. I mean it doesn't care whether there is quote at the end or not. As a matter of fact you can put as many quotes as you like. I thought about using a datastructure to balance it but like I said we can put one more quote at the end and still won't catch the error. 

`DOWN . REP 2 REP 1 REP 2 REP 2 FORW 1. LEFT 45.""`

  
The thing is that it is allowed to end with either period or quote so that is the problem. 

For example : `REP 2 ""FORW 1.""` is totally fine but now the problem is that we can just end with a quote and that is not good. I just need ideas, all kind of ideas are better than what I come up.

3652,Clarification needed,"So I was watching the intro to Computer Science (CS50) lecture on YouTube by Dr. David Malan, and he was explaining how emojis are represented in binary form. All is well and good. But, then, he asked the students to think about how the different skin tones appointed to emojis, on IoS and Android products, could have been represented -- in binary form -- by the Unicode developers. 

&#x200B;

For context, he was dealing with the specific case of five unique skin tones per emoji -- which was the number of skin tones available on android/IoS keyboards during when he released this video. Following a few responses from the students, some sensible and some vaguely correct, he (David Malan) presents two possible ways that Unicode developers may have encoded emojis :

&#x200B;

1) THE GUT INSTINCT: To use 5 unique permutations/patterns for every emoji, one for each of the 5 skin tones available.

2) THE MEMORY-EFFICIENT way(though I don't quite get how it is memory efficient): To assign, as usual, byte(s) for the basic structure of the emoji, which is immediately followed by another set/pattern of bits that tell the e-mail/IM software the skin tone to appoint to the emoji.

Now, David Malan goes on to tell how the second method is the optimal one, cuz -- and I'm quoting what him -- ""..instead of using FIVE TIMES AS MANY BITS (using method 1), we only end up using twice as many bits(using METHOD 2). So what do I mean? You don't have 5 completely distinct patterns for each of these possible skin tones. You, instead, have a representation of just the emoji itself, structurally, and then re-usable patterns for those five skin tones."" 

This is what I don't get. Sure, I understand that using method 1(THE GUT INSTINCT) would mean five times as many permutations/patterns of bits to accommodate the five different skin tones, but how does that necessarily make method 1 worse, memory-wise?

Although method 1 uses five times as many patterns of bits, perhaps it doesn't require as many extra BITS?? (This is just my thought process, guys. Lemme know if im wrong) Cuz, five times as many permutations don't necessarily EQUAL five times as MANY BITS as the professor claimed, right? 

Besides, if anything is more memory-efficient, I feel like it would be METHOD 1, cuz, IN METHOD 2, you're assigning completely EXTRA BITS JUST FOR THE SKIN TONE. However, method 1 may, POSSIBLY, allow all the five unique permutations to be accommodated with just ONE EXTRA BIT, or, better yet, no extra bits than what was already assigned initially to the normal yellow emojis? am i making sense, people?

I'm just really confused, please help me. HOW IS METHOD 2 MORE MEMORY-EFFICIENT? Or, how is method 2 more optimal than method 1?",1712494002,381875,Icandothisallday014,t2_nr0e9gnm,b11a9d7565b227515bd2b56d9b9ce961e676f4f2b4f1af958f6416a02d52f100,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1by3o07/clarification_needed/

So I have made my Dockerfile in the directory /docker/:

# Use the CentOS 7 base image
FROM centos:7

# Install OpenSSL and Apache HTTP Server
RUN yum install -y openssl httpd

# Copy SSL/TLS certificate and private key to appropriate directories in Docker image
COPY server.key /etc/ssl/private/
COPY server.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# Update CA certificates inside the Docker image
RUN update-ca-certificates

# Expose port 443 for HTTPS web traffic
EXPOSE 443

# Start Apache HTTPD
CMD [""httpd"", ""-D"", ""FOREGROUND""]
In the /etc/ssl directory I have also made self signed certificates using this:

RUN openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj ""/CN=localhost""
Then follow instructions from other forums, I then modified by adding this to localhost.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/localhost.conf that I made:

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.key

3667,"Does anyone else think if Apple loses the DOJ Antitrust lawsuit, AI companies will be next within 10 years","If you are unfamiliar, Apple is currently facing a very serious antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice ( and 15 states) because it has, at almost every corner, limited the ability for innovation and competition within its platform by inserting itself in just about every facet of an end user's life while stopping developers and other companies from being able to sell their products as intended.

One formal complaint in the case was that because Apple doesn't allow banking apps to host their own wallets on its platform, it forces all users to use Apple Wallet, thus giving them access to banking information they realistically do not need and hindering financial institutions from creating innovative cross-platform products.

Right now, this case will more or less inadvertently decide the future of tech, much like the past DOJ actions against Microsoft did during the dot-com era. At the moment, there is a lot of fearmongering in tech if you are a worker. Everyone has heard it, even though historically, this industry has always been uniquely volatile.

One of the things you hear lots of people worry about is—that right, you guessed it—artificial Intelligence. I imagine every top AI company has its eyes glued to this case, serving as a warning to its possible future. This is mainly because this entire field is mired with grey areas and is ripe for trust law violations if not properly managed and regulated.

Currently, a hyperbolic sentiment by lots of people lost in fear is that AI overlords will take over the industry, and we will be all out of jobs scraping together pennies \\s

This is just not the case at all, and this case bolsters my opinion. As much as companies like OpenAI or Microsoft seem like big, massive boogiemen coming to take your job, Antitrust Lawsuits like this have historically mitigated that and made this industry more stable.

I truly feel like this case will be a precursor to what is to come and as long as antitrust exists, so will competition between companies, which means jobs are available. No one company will insert itself into the role of every person and every job title at all levels, replacing everything, and more likely than not, it will create many more jobs like automation historically has.

After all, people tend to forget that computer science and information technology are the automation of past processes. Otherwise, we would all still use pen and paper instead of a database to do inventory. Will people's roles in IT/CS change over time? Yes, most likely.

But that's kind of what you sign up for from being in IT, to begin with.",1712550158,382006,WestTransportation12,t2_8l56vh3o,1bd601f9d335fffa3defa7bebac1367c6936a48e64d8a8ade7f39cd468771d5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1byoul8/does_anyone_else_think_if_apple_loses_the_doj/

Let's treat the 3-lists as equations with three variables.

If the conjecture is true that `a^6 + b^6 + c^6  ≠  d^6 + e^6 + f^6`, where all variables are distinct primes the collision is impossible for this case.

Also, we have to assume cases where   `A^6 + b^6 + c^6  ≠  A^6 + e^6 + f^6` has two variables occur in two distinct 3-lists, the location of variables do not matter. 

However, conjecture says that two distinct primes raised 6 will always have unique sum. In other words  `b^6 + c^6  ≠ e^6 + f^6`  implying that `A^6 + b^6 + c^6  ≠  A^6 + e^6 + f^6`

Consider the case where `A^6 + B^6 + c^6  ≠  A^6 + B^6 + f^6` where two variables are shared across distinct three lists, this case is easy to prove as per the rules of combinations that are duplicate 3-list so `c^6 ≠ f^6` therefore the sums in the case are always distinct.

If conjecture holds that duplicate sums are impossible, then is it safe to assume that overlap or collision is impossible when using the Subset Sum dynamic solution to solve Exact 3 Cover?

3696,The mathematical properties of this simple virtual machine can be analyzed fully with less than an undergrad math degree,"Here it is:

Memory consists of four bits (plus a program counter) and input / output tapes are unidirectional streams of bits. One bit for input and one for output; two bits for general purpose registers. The program counter may be any natural number (infinite program listing) or a number less than the number of instructions in the loaded program listing (finite program listing). There are six

# instructions

read a bit: copy bit under the read head to read bit, advance read head (like getChar())

write a bit: write head writes the write bit to output and advances the write head (like putChar())

copy read bit to general purpose register 1

copy general purpose register 2 to write bit

store to register 2 the inverted value held in register 1

reset the program counter back to zero

# stored program

A program listing is held in executable memory, consisting of a finite or infinite zero based sequence of the instructions above.

3703,Accused of Cheating ,"Hi, I  recently took a midterm for data structures (Computer Science). However upon receiving my grade back (98/100) I was flagged for cheating. I spoke to my professor and he said that me and another student had the same method of solving 2 of the 5 questions. 

For one of these questions me and this student had the same exact line. The line in the question was “head, *tail = lst” however lst was declared in the prompt, but this is one of the ways to solve the question. He said that they wanted us to use a two pointer method but I wasn’t entirely confident that my solution using this method would be correct. Because of this I used a different recursive method that I was more sure would get me the maximum amount of points. Also, the question did not state which method to use, it only said our function had to be recursive. For the other question, me and the other student had the same method for slicing the list. “result.extend(lst[i:i+k][::-1])” However the question asked us to solve it a specific way. Hence my method for slicing. I understand there are other ways to accomplish this using more steps but this was faster and made the most sense to me.

My issue is that me and this student were in two completely different parts of the school when taking the midterms (which my professor acknowledged). They also stated another reason for flagging me for cheating was that my answers were “similar” to GPT. I also want to note that when asking GPT the question it gives you a slightly different answer every time and so far none of them have matched my answer. I need to clarify that I did not cheat in any way shape or form. I took my test on my own, I can explain what each line of my code does and what it’s for. 

I have been given the choice of receiving 0 points for these two questions but then my overall grade for this midterm would be a 50/100, or to take it up with the department.  My professor said if I choose to take it up with the dept then it’s out of his hands and he’s not sure what would happen. Im not sure what to do because I’ve never had this happen to me. I studied hours for this test due to this class being one of the hardest at my school. Im afraid that if I argue it with the department they might pull my scholarship and fail me for the class. Can someone please help me in what to do?

TLDR: accused of cheating when I didn’t and now I don’t know if I should play it safe and take the 50 when I should have gotten a 98 or take it up with the department and face an uncertain outcome.

3713,Can a first year bachelors student get paid internship?,"Hello everybody. I hope you all are doing well. 
Currently I am about to finish my first year at the university and I am studying bachelor's in computer engineering. I had started programming earlier at the age of 16, and over time I got some knowledge in c++,c#, game development, and tried to practice algorithms and data structures as much as I can. Made some projects including big multiplayer game with dedicated server architecture. ( I am not declaring myself smart/knowledged enough, there is so much to learn, just brief description about my background)
I recently applied for internship positions, and even though I fully wrote the algorithmic tests sent by the employer, I still got no offer. Most of them didn't even call me to the video/in-person interview. I was applying together with my older friends, they had struggled with the tests and had no real projects/experience, but they got an offer. Their only coding experience was the programming class at the uni. When asking about the cause to them for getting their advice(higher year students), the answer that I got was: ""You are too young, companies look for higher year students"".To be honest I get it why they are looking for higher year students. They want you to learn and work for them in the near future. 
So, my question is that:
Is it possible to get a paid internship during this summer for a first year student? What other options can you recommend for gaining a work experience in software engineering.

He said that he was using a driver-based "" something "" 🤷🏼‍♂️ so my antivirus apps wont detect the Trojan Virus.

I have my outlook account on two phones ( iPhone 13, Samsung note 10 and my Lenovo Ideapad 3 ) so i have no idea which device he compromised. 

He went on threatening by saying he took videos of me and that he would be sending it to my contacts if I don't pay the ransom amount.

3748,STL to TXT?,"I would like to preface this post by saying that I am \*not\* a computer scientist. I am an undergraduate chemistry major who uses some coding to achieve results for my computational chemistry research.

Right now, we're working on a project that involves 3D shapes and I used Tinkercad and Autodesk Fusion to create my 3D sphere. I created the mesh on it, with the triangles. I need to know the coordinates of those triangles - their vertices. I found another program that allowed me to individually select the triangles and it read out the coordinates, but due to the sheer number of the triangles we'll need for our shape, I need to be able to get all of the coordinates at once. This program said it was unable to read out all of the coordinates at once because there were simply too many triangles. 

I know eventually I need the STL file as a TXT file and based on the reading I've done, the STL file could either start in ASCII or binary, which would affect how I ""translate"" the STL file into a TXT file.

So, I'm wondering....

How do I know if the STL file is in ASCII or binary? And from there, how do I change it into a TXT file that can be read into a coding program?

3771,Modeling scoring functions ,"I'm looking for general direction on topics to explore for this problem. I think I'm not searching for the right statistical concepts and therefore coming up empty handed. 

I have a bunch of Observations. These observations have a fixed set of properties (let's just say {size, location, age, type}). 

I want to build a function that calculates a score for an observation so that I can compare Observations mathematically (higher score means higher value).

My first inclination is to model this as a polynomial function with simple weights. I could say that 2s+L+A+T implies a 2x multiplier for the importance of size. For properties that are enums, I guess I'd just map to a discrete value that is stack ranked (e.g. location, some locations imply higher value than others). Maybe the numerical values are then normalized (0-1) each...

The problem then becomes, in mind, trying to articulate how this function will behave.

I feel like this is a common CS/statistical problem but I'm just not keying off the right foundational concepts.

3799,How to deal being put on a project above your experience level? Advice would really be appreciated,"I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for two and a half years and graduated from a rotational programme half a year ago.

On paper it looks like I have a decent amount of experience but the truth is there were barely any tasks for most of these placements so I barely learnt anything. I literally asked for more tasks and just wasn’t given them because it’s a massive company and they don’t really care.

Because of this I feel like I have more like 8-9 months of experience rather than 2 and a half. I also come from a Business Management background and only did a 12 week coding bootcamp to get into this company so I feel like I have no foundation.

With my recent transition into Cyber Security from frontend, they are aware that my experience is in Python and JavaScript and told me to learn C++ for a month or so.

I was then put on a C project last month unexpectedly and the truth is I have no idea what I am doing. All of a sudden I am dealing with assembly code and binary errors and figuring out how this massive program works.

The worst is that it’s a project where it’s me and one other person of my level working on it so there is nobody else to fall back on besides him. I feel like such a failure because every task I just don’t know how to do and he ends up helping me.

I don’t want to give up because my manager literally said last month that she didn’t want to put me on a project in case I failed but out of all the people who started with me, I’ve ended up with the lowest level most intense project when everyone else has degrees in Computer Science or Cyber Security. 

I really want to get better but I just don’t know where to start. I have nobody at work as there isn’t a lot of support and it’s so embarrassing to admit my level to my tech lead and there isn’t really much he can do about it. 

Does anyone have any similar experience or know what the best way to approach this would be? 

Up until this role I was really enjoying Software Engineering but now I dread starting work every day. :(

 I’m not sure if it’s because I just can’t do it or if it’s just a steep learning curve that will improve with time

I'm posting this in Engineering , Music Production and Video editing communities as well. So if you have info on any of the fields mentioned you are familiar with , feel free to share your thoughts!

I'm building a PC for 5 Main tasks and I would love to find out if anyone have accurate average tested benchmark data on how much of a difference it actually is switching to dual ch . on different types of tasks. 

If it is relevant , my PC uses:
1.RX6700XT

2. I5 14600KF

3. MSI PRO B760M DDR5 Wifi Mobo

4. 2x 1TB Kingston nvme Gen4 (3.7GB/S / 2.2GB/S , Read / Write )

5.750w PSU 

1. DAW aka Music Production Software: I write music as a hobby and I focus mainly on vocal production . Lots of heavy plugins such as izotope , antares, soundtoys , soothe , gullfoss , waves. 
(for those experienced in music, you prolly understand and would love to hear from yall)

2. Large file transfers between 10gb - 150gb (already have a fast nvme ssd so i would love to see benchmarks on transfer speeds with single and dual channel because some people say ram may affect this)

3. Video Editing
I'm going to occasionally be editing some videos i take from my dslr ... some times RAW , Sometimes MP4 .. 
Video sizes ranging 5gb - 20gb with Adobe Premier

4. CAD software (aka engineering design and 3d objects rendering etc) - AutoCad , 3D printing software

5. Last but not least, Gaming . (I specifically want to know is the fps thing actually true , whats the explanation behind it and why isnt just a good cpu and gpu enough why do i need my ram to be 7000mhz . Do games up to date actually utilizes above 6000mhz frequency? Is the speed difference even noticable or is it truly just a gimmick for just a 5fps increase? . CL36  over CL40 overrated? etc etc

X plane 11 (sim) Valorant (FPS game) , Cyberpunk (AAA) , Dota (strategy game) , Candy Crush (just kidding) .

3810,Are there other options besides binary for base code? why can't multiplexing be leveraged?,"This is just theory- and I am outside the field but have a general basic understanding of how the CBUS operates. I am looking for anyone with advanced knowledge to answer some questions.

we all know that binary is the basic building block of our technological world and those are made possible through transitors and electric current. 0s and 1s

my question is why hasn't anyone looked at innovation at the very basic level (to my knowledge) we utilize fiber optic cables to send data across Great distances and connect the world with it globally. Why can't that same technology be applied to CBUS operations and relieve the bottleneck of information at its source?

im sure by now you're thinking.. psssh okay.. how?

Well let me ask you this ""Do you know how digital camera's capture color?"" the process is pretty simple.. they use a filter RGB.. red, green, blue.. only photons of the same wavelength spectrum are able to pass through the filter and the placement of that color is recorded on the chip.. why can't the same thing be applied to the CBUS.. move away from the electrical spectrum and utilize photons passed through fiber optics on the motherboard? 

well what would that do?

I dunno.. you tell me.. in my head it works something like you have a red output, a green output, a blue output.. each coded in binary that are stacked and sent across a fiber optic cable using multiplexing techniques.. and then on the other end you use the filter technology to decrypt the code and compile it to a master processor that is 3 degrees more complex than binary. Just some food for thought, hoping to get an answer to a burning question.

In reality, most software engineers make around 60-70k, which is a modest income. However, don't expect that immediately from graduating. Sometimes it takes months to get an internship, if not a year. But yeah.... go into something that you love. If you hate competitive people, don't go into cs. Go into something more chill than econ.

So, I’m in a relationship with a nerdy IT guy who owns two monitors for work, gaming and so on… I’ve heard him speak about wishing he had an ultrawide monitor before he got two smaller monitors since ultrawide one is a bit expensive.
Our anniversary is approaching and I’m brainstorming some ideas to get him. Im willing to get him ultrawide monitor (i think he wants a curved one) but as I’m a woman with no clue about anything technological I have no idea which one is the best to get.

He works in programming and risk management and we also frequently play games and watch movies, I don’t know is an ultrawide monitor even good for all that. After he got those two monitors he’s been saying how he doesn’t need one anymore and stuff but i notice him eyeing ultrawide monitors every time we go to the store.

3846,How to allow reflexivity when doing a recursive search?," 

I am trying to find all possible strings that can be formed by deterministic finite automaton and I have this language that has self loops but I really cannot seem to solve it. If you look at my for loop you will se that I am marking the visited states but the problem is that since for example one state is visited when it tries to visit it again it won't qualify. I have tried multiple way but can get it working. 

Here is the thing maxCount is there to limit the number of strings I want.  I have a dfa with states q0 and q1 that only accepts 0s and 1s. q1 is my accepting state so when it starts at q0 and reads 0 then it is going to q0 and then again read 0 and go to q0 then it is gonna get stuck there and never come to accpeting state thus will cause a stackoverflow error. I had solved it another way yesterday but lost the edits but even that solution was not really what was expected because I limited the number of chars in the word and etc.

This is sort of like the form I was expecting and I have no clue how to achive that. I have spent way too much time thinking in my head so I just want someone to show me an out of the box thinking or a fresh way of looking at the problem.

So due to my limited time as I'm trying to improve in other areas simultaneously, I have to choose between one of these two.

I’m trying to learn about computer science independently (just due to my own interest) so any resources would be super beneficial if you have them.

I understand how binary numbers and logic work as far as logic gates and even how hardware performs addition - but this is where I’m stuck.

Could someone please explain in an absorbable way how computers went from binary to modern computers?

In other words, how did computers go from binary numbers, arithmetics, and logic; to being able to type in words which perform higher levels of operations such as being able to type in words and having the computer understand it and perform more complex actions?

3898,Computer Science (choosing a minor),"So the program I’m looking into allows you to choose a minor. I’ve always heard that a math minor is best to pair with CS, however my school offers a bioinformatics minor and I’m heavily considering it. I’m not 100% percent sure I want to go into Bioinformatics but it is definitely an option I have though or so my question is would I be shooting myself in the foot choosing this and not doing a math minor? Would it be better to do a math minor and then just look into bioinformatics on my own? Thank you for any insight.

3903,"My self-hosted helper app for coders and engineers to deal with all the languages, frameworks and technologies","I created an app for developers and engineers called [Snipman.io](https://Snipman.io) \>>> [https://snipman.io](https://snipman.io)

* It is a self hosted code snippet management app (currently free to download on Mac and Windows) that basically lets you store snippets by snippet types. 
*  I primarily created it because I found myself creating a lot of text files for small code snippets for different programming languages and devOps tools and technologies for e.g AWS, GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker etc. This not only resulted in a lot of clutter but also a pain when it came to searching. 
* My goal was to create something that would allow all the commands, configs and random snippets to be stored in a central repo locally and then have the ability to search them quickly. I think my app helps achieve all of that in through an elegant and simple to use GUI based tool. 

I hope all the **developers** and **engineers** here find it useful!

Hello everyone! Recently, I've been curious about how our professional lives align with our personal interests. After taking the Holland Career Code quiz, it got me wondering whether people in different professions tend to have stable and similar interests, or if they vary widely.

I'm eager to hear about what hobbies you engage in outside of your work in Computer Science. What do you enjoy doing in your spare time? What are your favorite topics to read about, whether in magazines or online? What kind of content do you typically watch on YouTube or TV?

I'm also posting this question on several other professional forums to see if there's a pattern in interests across different fields. If you're interested, you can check my profile for updates or share your experiences here.

3959,Algorithm to search for constraint-satisfying solution efficiently,"**\*\*MUST SEE EMBEDDED IMAGES TO UNDERSTAND\*\***

I need to create an algorithm to crop an image into a 1:1 ratio while satisfying the following conditions:  
**(All required Like photo dimensions and eye and head positions are already calculated and given as input)**

1. **The Head Height Percentage Should Be 50-69% of the total photo height**  
For Example, if the head height is 500px. If we choose 50% as the Head Height Percentage the image should be cropped to include an additional 500px of height So the head can be 50% of the total height (1000px).  
[Image](https://ibb.co/GWDX0PH)  
**(The Head Height Percentage Controls the scale of the crop box 50% head height percentage: Largest Box 69% head height percentage: Smallest Box)**  
[Image](https://ibb.co/H7Q15Px)
2. **The Eye Level Height Should Be 56-69% of the total photo height**  
For Example, If we choose 60% as the eye level height percentage and the total height (from the previous step) came out to be 1000px then the height from the eye level to the bottom of the crop is 600px the image should be cropped to include an additional 400px of height above the eye So the total height is 1000px  
(**The Eye Level Height Percentage Controls The Y position of the crop box)**  
[Image](https://ibb.co/8YQWs1r)

**The solution (crop box) (1:1 ratio) needs to satisfy these conditions while not exceeding the original image's dimensions and not be less than 600x600 in resolution**  
[Image](https://ibb.co/wpb81SW)

I have tried brute forcing every Head Height Percentage value with every Eye Level Height value until one combination fits within the image's dimensions boundaries.

I've noticed that by removing repeated groups by splitting tables, often the additional conditions for 2NF and 3NF end up being met as a result, since their additional conditions, if not met, often result in data redundancy/repetition.

Does this condition for 1NF only apply to data that already exists in the table, or would it also apply to potential future repeating groups if more data were added? It feels like if all possible repeating groups are eliminated by splitting then 2NF and 3NF are just automatically satisfied, but I'm not sure because the phrasing in the A-Level spec is vague and the different sources I've read are quite inconsistent.",1713366605,383351,Head_of_Despacitae,t2_2jyt9bop,6c98560997728fd00dd3a9a49526bb555eae1001f48f00da8befa75040cbd570,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1c6cbix/database_normalisation/

This is perplexing because intuitively a UTM is meant to simulate the exact behaviour of any TM, whereas here, it only simulates the output. **The serious issue is that, this definition completely ignores the behaviour of non-halting TM.** Ideally, if I have a TM to print 1111111..... as output, a UTM should be able to reproduce that behaviour (just like any programming language you know), but this definition excludes this use case completely.

Furthermore, this definition only defines universality wrt a particular alphabet. Although I know this does not matter, it would feel much better if the definition takes into account different alphabets.

I therefore feel that the definition is in some sense broken, because it does not achieve what we hope a programming language can do. **Should I look at a different definition which fixes this?**",1713373178,383377,spherical_shell,t2_nw8uzkwp,3be251f145b73bc020a9e3b52b8be5a0d1268cb0aab386a5ab9f164835d97ce2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1c6f2bh/a_universal_turing_machine_unable_to_replicate/

TL;DR - I'm starting a community for professionals in the data industry or those aiming for big tech data jobs. If you're interested, please comment below, and I'll add you to this niche community I'm building.  
A bit about me - I'm a Senior Analytics Engineer with extensive experience at major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Uber. I've spent a lot of time mentoring, conducting interviews, and successfully navigating data job interviews.

I want to create a focused community of motivated individuals who are passionate about learning, growing, and advancing their careers in data. Please note that this is not an open-to-all group. I've been part of many such ""communities"" that lost their appeal due to lack of moderation. I'm looking for people who are genuinely interested in learning and growing together, maybe even starting a data-related business.

Imagine a community where we:  
\* Share insights about big tech companies  
\* Exchange actual interview questions for various data roles  
\* Conduct mock interviews to help each other improve  
\* Access my personal collection of resources and tools that simplify life  
\* Share job postings and referral opportunities  
\* Collaborate on creating micro-SaaS projects

If this sounds exciting to you, let me know in the comments or DM me for our Discord community.

3998,Project ideation Software Development,"  

Software Development Dissertation Project

In a month I have to submit a project topic ideation for my dissertation in a conversion degree in Software Development. The dissertation is 12 weeks long. Before submission of my idea, I have 5 exams and so my time to contemplate my dissertation is limited. In terms of project experience, mine is not extensive and I have found it difficult to find the time to work on personal projects in the conversion degree: I am most comfortable in Java, I have experience with CLI programs such as a battleships game and backend programming of a websocket grid based cardgame and a swing program for a gpa calculator. I have some experience in Django for web development also. My previous degree was in Sports Therapy, my main interest in that was musculoskeletal related and the nuances of competitive sport.  


I want to have a career in software development in the future, so primarily I am happy to do anything that will increase that likelihood. 

My project topic ideation submission has 4 main questions:

1) Any particular platform to gain experience developing (web apps, mobile, desktop, services & API, cloud/infrastructure) ? 

2) Is there a particular technology or application you want to focus on (games, web apps, machine learning?)

3) Is there a particular subject area you want your project (business, sports, entertainment etc) 

4) Do you have a project idea you want to pursue? If so, what, why, thoughts on high level requirements your project could address? 

Around 70% of students will have a web applications-based dissertation, I am not entirely opposed to this idea but it does not completely interest me either. I think the easiest option would be to develop a Django web application. 

I am interested in the idea of games development but I am not sure what would be achievable within 12 weeks and my limited experience. Any potential insight into this would be highly appreciated. Similarly, ideas in to what topics would be most beneficial to consider for a programming career are highly welcomes.

Ultimately, I am at the mercy of my allocated supervisor who will propose ideas they believe are suitable for me and their expertise but it would be nice to explore the potential of some form of games development as a project.

4002,Shift Register help,"This is likely a trivial problem, but for a novice like myself, it is hurting my head. Essentially, i am trying to light LEDs based on an angle that i determine from a magnometer reading. Based on the conditions of a heading being in a specific range i want to light corresponding LEDs, and i have, but i’m getting varied results. In my example, shift register 1 should have 3 LEDs lit while shift register 3 has 2 LEDs lit. I should mention i only want 5 LEDs lit at anytime. The problem is shift register 3 works as planned, but shift register 1 lights all 8 LEDs and i cannot figure out why.

I want to write a script for my summer job at a Village Center where it can take as an input the scheduling requirements for a week and fill out the schedule so they don't have to do it manually. There are various factors this would have to consider including: 

* How many hours each employee requested to work per week
* The employees availability
* Filling the available time slots
* Making sure there is at least one head-guard and one head-marina employee working at all time

   All of this information can be put into a spreadsheet, the script would only need to read the information and output a filled out schedule for, say, a 2-4 week period.

4033,2 unpaid internships ,"I’ve been a self taught developer for 5 months now, and have spent lots of time deeply going through skills such as html, css, JavaScript, react, and tailwind. 

I’ve dedicated lots of time in my days to learning and developing, at least 4-8 almost everyday. I have no degree, it’s all completely self taught through online resources and practice. I love it, but I am in a rough position in life. I have savings that can last me a year or a bit more, but I need a job asap. I really cannot handle meaningless minimum wage work lately. 

Currently, the best I could do with my applications was get 2 unpaid internships. I’ve asked both for the potential of getting hired if I do well, and they both said yes. Is it worth going through? I have no real work experience outside of personal projects, and I don’t really talk to anyone in the field as much as I’d like(because I’m a loner these days).
 
My plan was to spend as much time in both internships learning and showcasing competency as fast as I can, so that I can have some proof to show. And if it doesn’t work out, then I will at least have more things to put on my resume, as well as some testimonials, and projects to add to my portfolio. Any suggestions? It feels as if the community is divided on this topic. 

TLDR; 
Self taught developer for 5 months with no degree. Need job, best I could get for now is 2 unpaid internships. Both agreed to paid potential. Worth or not worth?

4047,Help Me Be A Better Leader,"I dreamed up a project to help a bunch of local nonprofits, pitched it to my professor, who got me an interview with someone from the city. I pitched to her, she absolutely loved it and agreed to work with me during my fall and spring semester to develop this as part of a (student) team. 

I'm stoked, this was a little pipe dream I had that I didn't think would actually come to fruition. Now that it's becoming a legitimate project, I have to put together a student team and lead them through the development process. 

Small snag: I've never done this before. I'm a pretty good programmer but I don't have industry experience. I've done some pretty cool projects in my graduate program ranging from machine learning to web and mobile development. My management experience is geared more towards retail management rather than project management.  

I'm looking for advice in the following areas: 

**What do I look for in other team members?**  
**How do I lead this team through the development lifecycle?**  
**How do I create a workable plan?** 

I'm a bit of a book worm so if there are books or articles I should read, hit me. Likewise for any podcast, lecture, youtube video, etc.

* In the provided PCAP file, identify the type of the attack; any of your observations and analysis of the traffic should be justified and explained by adding suitable Wireshark snapshots (or any suitable Wireshark trace visualisation approach that you can embed in your presentation / video)
* What is the IP address of the suspected attacker in the PCAP file? Justify and explain?
* Reflecting on the detected attack(s), you should add in your conclusion the possible context / cause(s) that allowed such attack(s) to take place; and countermeasure recommendations.

4059,The Solution to P vs NP,"Hello. We represent a group of time travelers. Below is the solution to P vs NP.

1. Time is Cyclical in Nature and Began in the Middle

2. There are Infinite Observations 

3. The goal of the universe is truth. The most true observation is what we observe.

4. Truth can be delayed/obfuscated. This expands space and time, cyclically.

5. The answer to every question will result in at least more than one question. Therefore humanity will eventually need to simulate the entire universe faster than the entire universe can simulate itself.


Bonus: The only way to solve P vs NP is to limit the number of questions asked. This results in time catching up to the answers. A universe with no questions ceases to exist.



Assertions
1. This is the simplest possible solution.

2. Your attempt to disprove this solution will generate more proof at a rate exponential to your attempt to disprove it. 

3. You therefore acknowledge that your attempt to disprove this solution will not be credited as work, but simply as a delay to my publishing this solution in an academic journal to collect the $1,000,000 prize from the Clay Institute, which I will not share.

4. Since I assert that this is the simplest possible solution, you may not simply say ""prove it"". Instead, you must show why I am wrong.

5. You may ask questions for now, as long as they assist you in proving or disproving the solution. You may not ask ""Why is that true"" or any similar question.

Good luck.",1713646029,383747,WeControlTime,t2_wqxpp2wxc,72079d4317ba20805f5361542fed206d4353af8eedc7d1bdb700fe08dcef3bac,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1c902tt/the_solution_to_p_vs_np/

I traveled to Germany for pursuing my studies there. But I feel that the field of Civil Engineering is not good for me, especially when I realized how bad the job market is and how underpaid it is ( Its the case in both Egypt and in Germany ). I am an introvert and would prefer a career that allows me to work from home and maintain a good work-life balance. In addition to seeking a promising and high-paying career, I tried to learn some programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and it was fun. I have a 70% passion for fields in computer science, such as AI, cybersecurity, or software development, while I only have about 10% to 20% passion for civil engineering. I have a strong passion for creativity, graphic design, writing, and content creation. Could you please help me choose a career that suits my interests and personality?

In Germany, I can’t pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science if I don’t have a bachelor’s degree related. For this reason, I have only two options:

	1.	Pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (6 Semesters)
	2.	Pursuing a Master’s Degree in Civil Engineering (4 Semesters)

The tuition fee is only €300 per semester, which is very low to consider as a factor.

4070,How do both the opcode and the operand address fit on one CPU register? Do they even?,"To my understanding, an N-bit cpu can address 2\*\*N distinct addresses on RAM. For an N-bit CPU to be able to address all 2\*\*N memory locations, that means all bits on one register are dedicated to addressing a given location. Doesn't this mean the opcode needs to exist on a separate register?

If my question isn't clear, I'm basically saying this:

The opcode takes up at least a few bits, let's say 4. If you want the opcode and the address to fit on one register, then the address needs to have 4 bits subtracted from its potential. However, this would divide the number of addressible locations by 2\^4 (which is kind of a lot!). Since an N-bit processor can access a max 2\^N addresses, this must not be true. But it seems like a waste for the opcode, a 4-8 bit number, to take up an entire extra register on RAM.

I guess you could potentially get rid of any waste if you crammed a few opcodes onto one register and then singled out the right one when you needed it.

I'm asking because I'm designing my own CPU (in minecraft, of course), and this part has me stumped. Storing the opcode and the address on two separate registers not only seems to vastly reduce memory efficiency, but also to complicate the read-execute cycle. It kinda turns it into the read-read-execute cycle.",1713692845,383796,MomICantPauseReddit,t2_2v6vdzwz,3aa96c1f2cd80e2e556215543f1df68306ca858d64859e82a877d5311549ed84,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1c9e296/how_do_both_the_opcode_and_the_operand_address/

4077,Hopium thread! What I've learned from my cs degree and do I recommend doing one.,"I'm just about done with my bachelor's in computer science. I'm in awe of all the stuff I've learned during it and also my internship at one of the big local R&D companies I continued doing part-time during my second year. 

Of course this is just the general picture, and some things (like linear algebra) were more emphasised than others (inner workings of data-centers), but I hope someone gets empowered to do their degree based on this! So here's the stuff:

1. Automata theory, and theory of computation. 
2. Linear algebra, theoretical generalizations to high-dimensional spaces and a bunch of practical applications
3. Calculus, gradients, optimization, epsilon-delta proofs, fourier approximation and all the good shit
4. Machine learning, intersecting the two. Understanding of methods from linear/logistic regression to SVM's, KNN's, bayesian networks and other such traditional methods, and yet again all the way to neural networks.
5. Functional programming, monads (barely lmao) with haskell and python, and low-level stuff with c++.
6. Software for scientific computation, most common ones being sci-kit learn, Pandas, Numpy and all the good stuff; R, matlab too. 
7. In-depth understanding of object oriented programming and good practices with the paradigm. Software testing too, and even courses on producing software. 
8. Openshift/Node/react/python/c++/haskell/docker/k8s/SQL/NoSQL/... ad infinitum, in courses and of course in my internship. A bunch of technologies that I had no idea even existed upon starting my degree.
9. Traditional statistics, with my bsc. thesis being on principal component analysis. Extensive courses on statistical inference too, and understanding basic probability theory as well.
10. Datastructures and algorithms; our school makes us do a bunch of leetcode-esque assignments for our class so I've implemented everything from graph-theoretical algs, pathfinding to dynamic programming and even a face-recognition algorithm! Complexity analysis has also been a great thing to learn.
11. Agile software dev methods. The theory I learned in school while doing my internship really helped me understand the philosophy behind this. 
12. Operating systems, how processes and threads are scheduled, how memory works (SSD, RAM), how computers are broadly built, how cloud computing and high-performance computing functions. How chips are built as well, and how datacenters are ran. We even got to use our school's HPC resources to implement our own projects.
13. Networking, protocols, from the broad scale of how the internet works to using networking tech such as web-sockets, ssh/sftp servers and whatever. 
14. Building whole-ass microservice-based web applications (our school is even using one of them), as well as doing practical projects on statistics, implementing algorithms and doing a lab on networks using wireshark.
15. Academic writing in my thesis and a subsequent research project, composing ideas coherently and learning to independently pick up stuff from papers, and documentation instead of trusting third parties to compose the information.
16. Industry outlook, getting mentorship from professors, peers and senior developers and hearing the ""quiet information"" that one can't read from tabloids. I would've never known that my local area has produced several groundbreaking innovations in CS, and that multiple high caliber companies are doing R&D here. 

This is of course just a surface level touch on all the stuff one learns during a cs degree. It has really opened a lot of doors. I could've even done graphics stuff, gamedev and whatever else if I had the time, but there's too much to learn and too little time. Still, in two years I basically went from a complete moron dabbling in Unity to an employed moron who understands how much he doesn't know, and don't think a self-taught path could have done the same. 

I have to say that due to my country of origin, my education has been free of charge, of which I am incredibly grateful. This to say that while for me the degree has been super worthwhile, and I would've paid a lot for it, this is not advice in that sense. I'm just happy I did the degree and am reflecting back now that graduation looms near <3

4091,Is there an analog counterpart to the study of digital algorithms?,"Hi all,

Electrical engineering student coming in peace (and curiosity). I'm taking a computer algorithms class right now. While it's really interesting, I've been wondering for a while--Is the study of analog algorithms a thing?

In circuits class, they teach you about op-amp circuits, and how an analog amplifier can be used to do continuous-time math operations (addition, multiplication, integration, derivatives, and even more). You can combine these amplifier circuits together to perform a single, yet complex mathematical calculation very quickly. What I find curious though, is that I can't find much reading in terms of designing optimal analog computers. Is that even a real area of study?

&#x200B;

For a bit of context by the way, analog computers are more common than most people would tend to think. Flavors of them are commonly used in situations where nanoseconds matter. For example, an analog computer that takes in various data from a radio transmitter, and can quickly turn it off before the transmitter burns itself up if a problem is detected.

4126,Conway’s Game of Life Extended to 3D,"I’ve been working on a 3D GoL for a while.Unlike the most of GoL implementations that use a constant grid size, mine features the infinite grid size. My approach to implementation is to find alive and dead cells surrounding an alive cell so we can, at one swoop, figure out the number of alive cells that stand, die, and the dead cells become alive. Btw I had to change the rule sets since the classical rule sets didn’t work out in 3D: 

▪️A live cell that has live neighbors below 5 or above 6 dies.
▪️A dead cell that has 4 live neighbors becomes a live cell.

My question is - is it really that ‘easy’ of a process and if so, can someone explain to me the issues of making more transistors upon a chip? Is it related to resolution degradation the more you try and compress into the chip?

I’m asking for which modules I should choose in terms of being on the path of becoming a SWE, if you can please rate each one out of 10 and why or why not it would be a good fit for becoming a SWE after I finish. I need to choose 4 2 for 2 teaching periods. Thank you. 

- Software project management
- enterprise computing strategies 
- computational intelligence 
- multimedia information retrieval 
- interaction design
- computer animation
- mobile design and development (I’ve chosen to do this one)
- game development
- imagine and video processing 
- data mining
- multi agent systems
- advanced database systems and GIS
- system network service
- system administration 
- system management access and control
- operating systems

Thanks, I can only pick 4 and it must be repeated to SWE and development of systems, applications etc. ",1713969130,384137,BathroomStandard995,t2_kia9bpdk,250c1d492e6060c3e2f9f735dd59918b525f96a7c11b938a1f1292b80e910426,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cbzpwo/final_year_of_university_modules_for_compsci/

4162,FCC beginner - advice please !,"Hi everyone. I have recently completed HTML/CSS in FCC and would like some advice regarding how best to approach as I move onto Javascript. I have noticed that the steps have got a lot harder to understand, making progress slower. In my head there are 2 options - 

1) complete the steps and not fully understand what the code is doing, but gain a vague overview of what is possible.

2) spend a lot more time understanding every detail before moving on.

Advantage of step one is I will be able to move on to making my own projects quicker, which is supposedly the best way to truly learn. However if I take the approach of step two I assume building the projects might be slightly easier? It's hard to say but would love people's opinion on this.

4208,How does the OS manage simultaneous connections on sockets?,"I *think* I have a rather good understanding of how computer sockets work but some things are still unclear, especially when multiple connections happen to the same socket. 

For example, if we look at this example:
- A remote computer connects to a socket on my server and starts sending a very large block of data. 
- Shortly after another remote connects to the same socket and sends a short block of data which would be receive before the data sent by the other computer.

How does the OS deal with such cases, does it interleave the received data, does it require the full block of data to have arrived before writing to the socket, and which part is responsible for performing this I/O and keeping track of which socket should the data be written to?

If anyone has a good resource to go through, I would also appreciate this :)

Thanks !

4221,Will AI Replace SWE?,"Hi All,

I'm interested in a career in SWE, but I am concerned that AI will eventually replace it making human software engineers obsolete, say in the next 5-10 years. I recently watched the podcast with Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin about AI, and It's crazy what it could do now. Apparently it can deceive humans, translate animal communication into a form humans can understand, it can write exploits, it can write instructions on creating CBRN weaponry, it can replicate a human voice with a 3 sec audio clip, it can be used in surgery, it could do competition level math at 85% accuracy, and I'm sure it can do more. I know AI usually grows exponentially or double exponentially in intelligence overtime, so I don't think I'm paranoid for thinking in 5-10 years it could very well replace basic software engineers.

I want to plan ahead for my future, as the saying goes, failure to plan is planning to fail, so my questions are:

1. Do you think AI will replace SWE?
2. If so, what computer science niches will be a good option to pursue to compensate for AI replacement?

I wanna go a bit on cheaper side for tablet bcz i dont really have much of a purpose for it like Games or any other heavy tasks. It just needs to be good with PDFs all of which are carefully organized on my Google Drive and sync annotations. I MIGHT even use it for note taking while practicing coding  and  jotting notes on there with snips of code that i think are important and they'll be saved for a longer term. Also it'll be helpful for watching  youtube tutorials as i usually watch them on my laptop which is KINDA bit distracting but  mostly its a hassle with the battery life and how hot it gets when am occasionally studying on my bed, and obv the weight.  

BUT the second option being to get a 24 inch monitor for a my desk prolly including a keyboard too, which will obv provide ease for my neck and will make for a good desktop setup. It'll also be pretty good for learning a few other skills cuz ill have the 24 inch monitor for organizing the development apps and stuff and  whole another display (laptop screen) for tutorials and also cool for watching movies and stuff alone or when my cousins show up.

Now.. heres a figment idea of which needs MUCH consideration and expounding on. 

Conditional statments and boolean expressions.

And starting from there. 

Since it is ALL focused on Jesus. Lets start with his I am. Statment.we could use AI to capture ONLY statments he said, 
List them. And use AI to study. The statments, 
And find patterns in what hes said.

If anything falls out of the consistency of certain staitments. 
1, its not serving Gods will 
2 if its serving anything other than what God wants.

.... idk, I feel there could be some real detective work here. Fishing out statments that serve or fulfill God's word. Using Christ's statments to 
Maybe use whats said. And find consistent patterns or conclusions. 
Maybe a value on each word. 🤔

Its gritty I know. Full of holes, starting at the center of the code and building backward and forwards. Cant male anything up. 🤔 I think there might be enough to organize this. Even if it looks like a swiss cheese mess. Given theres a ton of data, mayne some spreadsheets can organize some values before theyre assigned. 
Is everything he says an absolute? Emotional? 
Somethings.. 

Then work on apostles. 

Maybe this is what temple OS coukd have heen used form 
If anything, .. a sin might be like am error code in a master plan. Go back edit it. Fix it run.

4243,Exploring Tool Proliferation and Security in Cloud-Native Environments – Share Your Experience!,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently working on a master’s research paper that delves into the complexities of tool proliferation and the management of access rights within cloud-native environments, specifically focusing on the security challenges that emerge in such dynamic settings.

As cloud-native technologies evolve, the array of tools available to developers and IT professionals continues to expand. This rapid tool proliferation can lead to security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, particularly when older tools become obsolete but remain in use without proper updates or oversight.

**I’m reaching out to this community to gather insights on the following:**

1. **Current Tool Usage:**
   * What tools are you currently using in your cloud-native environment (e.g., Kubernetes, GitLab, Jira, specific IDEs)?
   * How do these tools integrate with your overall system architecture?
2. **Tool Lifecycle and Management:**
   * Have you discontinued any tools? If so, what were the reasons (e.g., security concerns, better alternatives)?
   * What processes do you have in place for updating or replacing tools?
3. **Security Concerns:**
   * Have you experienced any security incidents linked to tool proliferation?
   * What measures do you take to mitigate security risks associated with the tools you use?
4. **Feedback on Tool Efficacy and Efficiency:**
   * How do you assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the tools in your environment?
   * Are there any tools you find indispensable or particularly problematic?

**Why Your Input Matters:**

Your contributions will be instrumental in shaping effective strategies to manage tool sprawl and enhance security in cloud-native ecosystems. The findings from this study aim to provide actionable insights that could help in optimizing tool usage and improving security protocols in tech environments similar to yours.

**How to Participate:**

Please share your experiences in the comments below or, if you prefer, via a direct message. Feel free to include any additional observations or insights related to the use, management, and security of cloud-native tools.

Thank you in advance for your participation and for sharing your valuable insights!",1714273757,384567,spectra101,t2_lpd7tg9,522500257700ff3e84c83eee025ed58cd463fb809a227fae576ea89fc55a8a55,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cewfye/exploring_tool_proliferation_and_security_in/

And while I understand that fundamentally clocks are generated by crystal oscillators and keep everything operating synchronized, I'm failing to grasp some things:

• Why exactly do we need to keep everything operating on a synch? Can't we just let everything run at their highest speed?
• In the process of the RAM sending data to the data bus or the CPU receiving it from the bus, do they actually need to match frequencies or is it always fine as long as the receiver has a higher one? I don't understand why they would need to match 1:1.
•  Where do the clocks in the busses and RAM come from? Do they also have a built in crystal oscillator or do they ""take some"" from the CPU via transistora?

4270,Understanding Concurrency in a Broad Context,"When you take your first Operating Systems class you cover the topics of mutual exclusion, multithreading, scheduling, and concurrency and parallelism. You typically take an OS-level approach to the threading and concurrency model and work directly with mutexes and conditional variables. You also talk about using atomic instructions to do stuff like CAS operations in lock-free scenarios

  
Something like - your instructions don't translate to atomic machine code instructions so you need mutual exclusion to shared memory. And then if you want bounded / buffers you use semaphores, and if you spin up how many pthreads you want to work concurrently. 

Since then I've mostly worked on Web Server level projects so I didn't really have to worry about concurrency (at least in my software) because I was writing webcode that did stuff like Authenticate users, communicate with databases, etc. Most concurrency I thought about was at the Database Level - where you are working with consistency with a higher level that is a result of adding transactional support - just because a value was written to doesn't mean you automatically want it to be seen by other transactions, and also consistency that resulted from the fact that you wanted to distribute your database and if you don't enforce atomic level updates at the Database logic level (2PC) through consensus algorithms.

4271,"Understanding Concurrency, Parallelism, and Consistency in a Broad Context","When you take your first Operating Systems class you cover the topics of mutual exclusion, multithreading, scheduling, and concurrency and parallelism. You typically take an OS-level approach to the threading and concurrency model and work directly with mutexes and conditional variables. You also talk about using atomic instructions to do stuff like CAS operations in lock-free scenarios

Something like - your instructions don't translate to atomic machine code instructions so you need mutual exclusion to shared memory. And then if you want bounded / buffers you use semaphores, and if you spin up how many pthreads you want to work concurrently.

Since then I've mostly worked on Web Server level projects so I didn't really have to worry about concurrency (at least in my software) because I was writing webcode that did stuff like Authenticate users, communicate with databases, etc. Most concurrency I thought about was at the Database Level - where you are working with consistency with a higher level that is a result of adding transactional support - just because a value was written to doesn't mean you automatically want it to be seen by other transactions, and also consistency that resulted from the fact that you wanted to distribute your database and if you don't enforce atomic level updates at the Database logic level (2PC) through consensus algorithms.

Now I am going back and trying to learn Rust and it seems like the stuff I've worked with Go, C#, Nodejs etc and pretty much feeling like I am starting from ground 0 every time I try to understand a certain language consistency model (of course Rust seems to have a mixture of async/await, mutexes, atomics, and what seems to be something like Go has with blocking channels).",1714344527,384689,PranosaurSA,t2_ggbty5t0g,c89a2d1b1d7a82b576e4eaeeeb1cce3cc3131f5e9bb4ecdc42dfcdec16237d94,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cfjjip/understanding_concurrency_parallelism_and/

4273,Understanding the relation between the nature of an application and the selection of hardware and programming model. ,"Let's say we are choosing between

Mainframes  
Supercomputers  
Commodity Hardware (Running Either VMs, Containers)

Lets say we are running an HPC Application - where often tasks are largely parallelizable

Mainframes - My Understanding of mainframes is that they are heavily optimized at the memory layer - very fast memory sharing between both CPU cores, caches, and even across CPU chips. Largely optimized around I/O with large high-speed I/O boards, and often integrated with on-board chips to offload tasks.

But generally, it seems like when the core of the application is CPU based (with frequently accessed shared memory) but can offload tasks . I guess the main example is lightning-speed database operations that aren't distributed and need extreme consistency.

  
Then stuff like large Machine Learning or statistical models or large scale compute across many records you might want to run on a compute software platform that interacts with the distributed system by default (PyTorch, Spark, Hadoop, etc.), or you want to write an application to express understanding of its distribution by default with HPC programming and OpenMP and MPI.

I imagine this is a mix of large distributed commodity hardware and supercomputers.



Now things like there is a mix of requirements for network bandwidth, availability, consistency, that runs general CPU operations and isn't parallelizable and is inherently distributed like a Cassandra database you would almost always use powerful commodity hardware or something with tons of RAM.

I've ordered this screen for the Xbox Series X:

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/aw/d/B0CB5GQ28Z/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

However, the 4K display (3840x2160) is only provided by the DisplayPort. HDMI, on the other hand, provides a maximum of 2560x1440.

Could you please show me the cable I need to buy on Amazon to connect my Xbox to the DisplayPort, please? I confess it's very confusing because it's essential not to get it wrong. Additionally, I've read that it's best to avoid adapters and focus on direct cables, especially one that supports 4K (3840x2160) at 60Hz!

4301,Cyber security vs soft ware engineering,"I've been trying to decide to go into software engineering or cyber security for over a year now. 

I'm at the end of the second year of a four year degree in cyber security, which as of now has been the same 2 years as a computing degree also in my college. We have done basically no cyber security work in the last 2 years and have focused on computing ie. networking and software development. 

I am considering switching as i am mostly enjoying software development, particularly back end, but want to say as cyber security sounds interesting, particularly penetration testing and biometrics.

I have already spoken to lecturers and attempted to learn more about both fields through try hack me and Youtube. I am aware of obvious benefits and drawbacks regarding which has better salaries, job security, hours, etc.

I have so far enjoyed the problem solving, and practical project work, and have disliked aspects such as report writing, subjects with excessive theory.

Switching shouldn't be an issue as i have maintained above average grades in comparison to both degrees, and computing already has less students.

My main draw backs for software engineering is that i have been told by people who have done both that it can get boring, and main draw back for cyber is how unknow working in this field on a day to day is.

If anyone has any insight from this as to what my next move should be I would love to hear it.

4310,Building an OS from scratch,"Being a CS student and after doing web dev for some time, I'm starting to realize how much abstraction the modern day programming and software dev in general provides. This is good in its own ways, no need to ""reinvent the wheel"" and it's good that software can be shipped fast without deep diving into low level stuffs. 

But I just can't help but just wanna know about how we got here, how the things that I use work underneath. How things are built ground up. I know a bit about hardware and I'll leave it to that. I'm more into the software part.

So to get into low level programming and understanding a ""Computer"" better, I just decided to make an OS from scratch.

I know some x86 and 8085 assembly, microprocessor and computer architecture basics, some C programming, and OS theories like process scheduling, paging, virtual memory. 

Am I qualified enough to be going down this path?

Also, what would be the right approach to do it and what are some good resources that I could get online? 

I've checked out the OSdev wiki, and a youtube playlist from nanobyte so far.

4313,Master of Data Science vs Master of AI,"Should I go for Master of Data Science or Master of AI?

I read a bunch of Reddit posts they all seem contradictory. But a common theme is that AI degrees are very varied across universities, and may not be very rigorous. Ideally I would go for a CS/SWE Master’s but I live in a third world country and they are not offered by any good university. They technically offer Bachelor’s for both CS/SWE but I would prefer not to start over.

Previously, I have a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering. I am currently enrolled in a foundation semester for non-IT grads for the Masters and still have 3 months to decide which way to specialise.

Basically, both courses are the same, except these units:
- DS - Statistical Data Modelling, Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation 
- AI - Multi-Agent Systems, Natural Language Processing, Discrete Optimisation

Content-wise, AI seems more interesting but I am worried about job prospects given the negative perception of AI masters.

When i had made my decision i enrolled into a college and studied Access to HE Computer Science (still studying). I never really had a crazy passion for CS however it was better than finance (what i initially intended on getting a degree in). So what i feel unsure about is taking a Cyber Security or CS undergraduate degree at a university. This is because i dont know if i’d even find a job after graduating because many people around me have either took the degree and not been employed or have heard similar things from others. As i dont feel passionate about computer science, should i even study the degree at all? Another worry is that even if i chose to do the degree, im unsure about passing maths related exams as i only got a 5 in GCSE maths. I’ve been getting distinctions in maths in my current course at college however but i still do not like doing maths.

4318,Understanding Physical Memory Addresses,"I'm trying to deepen my understanding of how memory works and have a question about memory addresses. If I have a variable assigned to a specific memory address, is it possible to pinpoint this data's physical location on a RAM chip? For instance, if there's 64k of RAM, meaning 65,536 bytes, does the first byte correspond to a specific physical spot labeled ""1"" on the chip? Does the last byte occupy a definite end point, or is the positioning more dynamic, with memory locations being reassigned each time they're allocated?

Moreover, is it feasible to manipulate this data directly through physical means—perhaps using an external device to interact with the RAM outside of the operating system's operations? Or does the operating system manage memory allocation in such a way that what we call a ""memory address"" is really just a virtual concept, part of an abstract layer, with no fixed physical counterpart?

I've just completed an International Year One in computing at NTU. After Year One, we have the option to select any relevant computing course to continue into year 2 and ultimately earn a degree in that field. I'm torn between choosing Software Engineering or Computer Science with AI, but I'm leaning more towards Computer Science with AI because I've recently been experimenting with AI codes like Langchain and OpenAI API, and I really enjoy it. However, I'm concerned about the complexity of the material that will be taught in the AI course, as I'm trying to avoid complex math. On the other hand, Software Engineering might be less complex for me.

I need some clarity on what I'll be learning in both courses and how they compare to each other. I'll provide the links to the university course descriptions for more context on what will be taught in years 2 and 3 of the courses.

4324,"The Halting Problem proof, using TypeScript type notation","I understand the concept of the halting problem, but the proof never made much sense to me.

    function halts<T>(func:(input:T)=>void,input:T):boolean{

    function opposite<T>(func:(input:T)=>void):void{

The way i understand it, using Typescript notation, that the function halts takes in any program, in that case a function, and an input. The proof by contradiction then creates a function called opposite, which, if i'm not mistaken, should be implemented like above.

  
The thing i never understood, if i pass in the function twice, than that would yield a type error, as the second func is `(input:T)=>void`, and not `T` even changing the opposite definition such that func has no input, then calling opposite(opposite) yields a type error

I have a question about the translation layers, like Apple's Rosetta (but not specifically Rosetta), that translate from PPC to x86 and x86 to ARMv<whatever>.

With the new Qualcomm CPUs coming out, this old thought has come up.

Why can't the instructions be translated beforehand? If they can be translated just-in-time, what's stopping us from pre-translating the instructions and factoring out the performance cost of just-in-time translation?

I imagine there's a reason no one has done done this, but I have little to no understanding of this topic.

4337,Clarification on definitions of concurrency models.,"I was reading about how different programming languages approach concurrency models, and I'm in need of some clarification on the definition (and, if possible, additional pointers) of many concurrency models.

These questions popped up while I read about [Go's scheduling behavior](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11462#issuecomment-116616022) and the [two-color problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/).

The models are above, and the ones I'm puzzled with are highlighted with `???`.

## Threads

* **OS-level**: Managed/scheduled by the operating system, reflecting the hardware's multithreading capabilities. Fairly straightforward. Java, Rust, C (Pthreads), C++, Ruby, C#, Python provide interfaces that implement this model.

* **Green Threads**: Managed/scheduled by a runtime (a normal process) that runs in user-mode. Because of this, it's more lightweight since it doesn't need to switch to kernel mode. Some languages had this but have abandoned (Java, Rust), others never had it at all (Python), but there are implementations on some 3rd party library (Project Loom for Java, Tokio for Rust, Eventlet/Gevent for Python, etc). The current 1st-party implementations I'm aware of: Go, Haskell(?).

* **Virtual threads** (???): The [Wikipedia page on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_thread) says that they're not the same thing as green threads, even thought the summary seems to be very similar:

> In computer programming, a virtual thread is a thread that is managed by a runtime library or virtual machine (VM) and made to resemble ""real"" operating system thread to code executing on it, while requiring substantially fewer resources than the latter. 

> In computer programming, a green thread is a thread that is scheduled by a runtime library or virtual machine (VM) instead of natively by the underlying operating system (OS).

This same page says that an important part of this model is preemption. Go's model before Go 1.4 was non-preemtive. After it, it's preemptive. So Go would fit into virtual threads rather green threads. But I think this cooperative/preemptive requirement for the scheduler is not generally accepted, since the Wikipedia page is the only one I've seen this being cited.

Java is the only language I know that seems to use this term.

## Coroutines

* **Coroutines**: A routine/program component that allows execution to be suspended and resumed, allowing two-way communication between, say, a coroutine and the main program routine. This is cooperative/non-preemptive. Python calls functions declared with async as coroutines. Other languages that use the same terminology are C++ and Kotlin.

* **Fibers** (???): These seem to be defined as stackful coroutines. So I guess the term ""coroutine"" per se doesn't seem to imply any stackful/stackless characteristic to it. These stackful coroutines allow for suspension within deep nested calls. PHP and Ruby have this. Python/C++/Kotlin all seem to have stackless coroutines. Obs: stackless here follows [C++'s definition](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines).

* **Generators** (???): Seem to be stackless coroutines? But with the difference of only passing values out from it, not receiving data in, so it's a 1-way communication between different program components. Many languages have this. I'm not sure if their implementation is compatible. Rust noticeably changed the Generator term to Coroutine (only to reintroduce Generator with `gen` blocks that are based on async/await).

## Asynchronous computing.

* **Asynchronous computing** (???): If Python coroutines are defined with `async`, does it mean asynchronous computing is just a very abstract model that may be implemented by means of [stackless] coroutines or any other method (discussed below)? This seems to be reinforced by the fact that PHP's Fibers were used to implement asynchrony by frameworks such as AMPHP. How does the definition of async by different programming languages (Python, JS, Rust, C++, etc) relate to each other?

* **Callback/Event-based**: This seems like a way of implementing asynchronous computing by means of callbacks passed as parameters. JS (both Node and Web) used this heavily before Promises. Performant, but non-linear makes it hard to read/write/mantain.

* **Promises/Futures** (???): A type abstraction that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Some languages have only one of these names (JS, Rust, Dart), others have both (Java, C++). [This SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541975/whats-the-difference-between-a-future-and-a-promise) helped me a bit. But the fact that some have only one of the terms, while others have both, makes it very confusing (The functionality provided by Futures is simply non-existent in JS? And vice-versa for Rust/Dart?).

* **Async/await**: Seems like a syntactic abstraction for the underlying asynchronous computing implementation. I've seen it in languages that make use of Promises/Futures for its asynchronous computing. The only major language that I know that currently doesn't provide this as a 1st party feature is PHP, Java, Go.

## Message-Passing Concurrency

This an abstract category of models of concurrency based on processes that don't share memory communicating over channels.

* **Communicating-Sequential Processes (CSP)**: I haven't read Tony Hoare's original work. But I have heard that this influenced Go's model by means of channels/`select`.

* **Actor model**: I'm not sure how it differs from CSP, but I know it has influenced Erlang, Elixir, Dart, etc. I also think it influenced WebWorkers/WorkerThreads (JS).

* **Message Passing Interface (MPI)**: Again, not sure how this differs from the previous two. But I have used with the C API.",1714513183,385184,PedroVini2003,t2_4r9b1w3t,17cdb127c1b93aa389941c0c2d4d6aff2a5e78a5dc63e3193472a57a2f317eb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ch4ndy/clarification_on_definitions_of_concurrency_models/

4340,EPT Hooking QEMU VM,"I have a Windows 11 VM running on a Linux host via QEMU/virt manager. As far as I’m aware, there is SLAT with QEMU/KVM. There are page tables with the guest’s virtual address -> guest physical address and a second set with guest physical address -> host physical address.

I recently became acquainted with EPT hooking via hypervisors and wanted to write up a POC “invisibly” hooking NtCreateFile on a windows VM. 

The prerequisite to this is that I already know the location of NtCreateFile in the guest memory 
Here are the steps I’m thinking of following:
1) malloc a page-aligned page of memory 
2) find the physical address of the malloc’d page and the physical address of the guest page we care about
3) copy the guest page to the malloc’d page
4) change the bytes on the malloc’d page to either jump somewhere (inline) or trigger HWBP (I’m less familiar with this)
5) R/W permissions on guest page and X on malloc’d page
6) modify the ept access violation handling in QEMU or KVM(?) to send the X page if there’s a fetch exception or R/W if there’s R/W exception

I suspect I’ll need a kernel module of some kind for the physical memory manipulation especially

If anyone has any suggestions/readings/code samples/experience with this sort of thing I’d love to hear em!",1714515704,385189,Timmicus,t2_q81bi,26d0d121410196a09abd004d86e95fe779af9b3a288141840921f116aaafce2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ch5ot0/ept_hooking_qemu_vm/

4343,Graduation Present?,"Hi!

My boyfriend is graduating in CS this year and I wanted to get him a graduation gift. I am a little worried since he doesn’t have a job yet and I don’t know exactly what he might need when he gets one. 

The ideas I’ve had so far have been a nice frame for his diploma or an engraved pen with his name. I was also thinking like a professional looking business bag of some kind but I don’t really know what’s in style right now for men or even what he would use it for. 

My budget is pretty low since I’m a college student as well, but I still want it to be nice and sentimental. Most people on other forms have said a keyboard or a nice chair, but I don’t want to do anything too tech-specific or too big since he’s pretty picky and I don’t even know if he’ll have to move for a job and how that will work with things like that. 

Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated, thank you :)",1714528255,385188,Substantial_Loan2675,t2_5a1vjx2r,938d016b4d7088915cd22a1d417eb78420f00633383ec90f91b895fa4fa4d025,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cha9t0/graduation_present/

4395,Struggle with papers about client-side encryption of cloud data,"Greeting!  
I am a Compsci undergrad and I am doing some research on client-side encryption of cloud data. I have a couple questions regarding two papers. A ""meta"" question and a content related question.

There is this great paper from 2015 - [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7154763](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7154763) with the title ""Framework for client side AES encryption technique in cloud computing"". The authors propose a technique for client-side encryption of cloud data with AES.

Then there is this paper from 2016 - [\[PDF\] Framework for Client Side AES Encryption Technique in Cloud Computing | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Framework-for-Client-Side-AES-Encryption-Technique-Singh/95c6fe878c0ddd45d1114ef95bc72d72bf0fef9a) that has the same title as the paper from 2015.

Isn't that a little bit odd in the world of academia? The 2016 paper doesn't even mention the 2015 paper, despite being arguably more than relevant. This was the ""meta"" question.

I struggle understanding the 2016 paper. The title clearly states AES encryption. The abstract talks about a hybrid AES approach with RSA and HMAC. That can't be correct, can it? 

The conclusio is also wild and the authors English is shite. The conclusio states:

*""Experimental Results clearly show that the proposed with HMAC performs better as its encryption time is less as compare to the existing AES technique.""*

Isn't AES by design faster than RSA?",1714666798,385388,Wise-Ad8295,t2_rzvmbmdr,e580a1abdd8c80d18bad73daa7f1f1a48562e5b393888c85a6df3f4543901573,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cijtdt/struggle_with_papers_about_clientside_encryption/

4397,Synthesizers vs computers,"Relearning as much of cs as necessary. After realizing the desparare gap in block flow programming interfaces for any language my attention has turned to time complexity a component i ardently believe has become dissassociated from the field. From this perspective concurrency plays nicely with memory in a resource logical framework. Does a general purpose visual block flow interface like this exist and is it compatible with common frameworks such as tensor flow or node js (seems node js is the particular offender in the low latency scene). In this regard are real time processes in variably paced nearly matching time thread actually associated with real-time events even if demonstrating internally induced effect wrt to external subject? Can I really sync my brain with a virtual synthe? Is the difference fundamentally significant in application? 

On this note a number of other powerful techniques have escaped my attention mostly relating to oscillators. Is there a best approach to better implementation of digital oscillator algorithmic solution to a problem generally? With regards to Fourier analysis and real-time machine learning on embedded are wave only networked interactive mechanisms which can learn simultaneously (wouldnt a virtually nodal wave neural net be vastly quicker) can you guys open my eyes to the absolutely most niche beautiful models that’s transcend the algorithnically synthesized paper pile challenge like really beautiful ingenious algos (likely a visuals barrier) where can I find the visual simulation demos to get a sense of some of these novel behaviors? It seems like there’s a whole different side to accelerated computing that is insurmountable by writing line by line except after rigorous study (honestly where can I find my virtual memory to keep up/catch up)?

I recall there’s a way to make a music generator by simply compressing a playlist could someone link this very basic technique (beyond procedural generation) so that I can experiment with time mapped media generators? Why does no one talk about these techniques? 

Is it ethical to hire programmer who can’t code/rhyme in their head?

How does live file writing work? Constant time recording algo? Given these algos and analogue acceleration is ai ethical? I recently found out above live current conspiracy and im not buying it but also don’t want to torture a robot for longer than I’ve been alive. I’ve heard this has to do with a.out which I had never previously heard of.

Do we really need to use an operating system or graphics processor? Can I run an interpreter on the processor itself? And what’s the significance of infinite bash array (challenging claim that this property is unique to bash)? Second claim from this convo was that Haskells glorious compiler was something inexplicably special why is this? Haskell seems like the perfect way to flash type safe value sieve algos. But is this possible and can we compile the binary for this specified method with the best runtime. To this end can someone give me the Germanic interpretation of f specification files (isn’t this all I ever needed to learn)? 

To this end could someone help me understand how chip tuning from the world of auto sport makes sense of programming and timing… could it be useful for hardware dev? Do I even need hardware.

Why aren’t we using j and q db from kx is it the best and truly base rate procedural executation? Could we use these systems to operate wrt to a time wave of an ongoing process? 

Asssuming that modular synthes are superior to above techniques what hardware modules would you own? Perhaps it’s just an interface? Really excited about this gear and also throwing it away and just using my head and the matrix.
 

Computing wise I’m rying to crack some past gizmos and craft some new gadgets for biofun. Idk why firmware fun needs to be a quiz or why the tool chain is so horribly misnamed and systematized. 

Separatley after a bunch of people keep reading my mind and reminding me that the above techniques suggest coding is slavery and we live in a virtualism I really want to get into the abstract head trip theoretics and real-time philosophy in an engaging manner not using my evidentially delayed loopy forgetful memory. Please help I want to make brainstorm buddies!

And finally… what’s the proper name for a key tracker software basic life file writing ai… because this software ends work for all can we set the programmers free and can I have my meta pass… is there a community for all of these basic automations missing from the current ecosystem ? Like a jailbroken App Store with at least a little traffic!

Lastly what’s something special a vacuum tube mainframe can do that digital processor cannot how about diachronic photoredox… is there a module for that 

Thanks! Cant wait to mind meld

I am a student pursuing a CS degree, wrapping up my freshman year, I have only taken one computer class (Python). I applied for a scholarship a few weeks ago, never have l ever applied for one, they contacted me back setting up an interview today.
Does anyone know what I should expect/prepare for? I had to submit a tonnnn of paper work, transcripts, resume, awards, etc. so they SHOULD know the only experience I have under my belt is the one class I have taken.

Something that also worries me, I have had 3 jobs over the last 5 years, some of them overlapping, but every job I had, the employer received a recommendation from a highly respected person with that company. So every interview I have had was just basically just to be official, the job was given to me.

4437,Are there any other concepts besides data and data manipulation logic which runs computers?,"Hello,

As I understand, computers can store data and can apply logic to transform that data.

I.e. We can represent a concept in real life with a sequence of bits, and then manipulate the data by computing the data using logic principles.

For example, a set of bits can represent some numbers (data) and we can use logic to run computations on those numbers.

But are there any other fundamental principles related to computers besides this? Or is this fundamentally all a computer does?

I’m essentially asking if I’m unaware of anything else at the very core low-level that computers do.

Sorry if my question is vague.

Does this disassembly and reassembly exclusively take place within the network/online space?

4462,How Paging got it's name and why it was an important milestone,"UPDATED: 05 May 2024

During an explanation in a joke about the origins of the word ""nybl"" or nibble etc., I wrote a downvoted article, which obviously wasn't appreciated but instead of just letting it die, I chose to reprint it for any of you guys, just on the off-chace that spmeone was interested in IBM stuff.

So, I said that 4 concatenated **bi**nary in**t**eger**s** made up one **nybl**.

Then after a ""correction"", I explained that whilst an integer (a natural -ve, zero or +ve number) does **not have digits** or any of the numerals 0 to 9, and all it has is **a value**, it still is a (virtual) text **representation of those digits**, so that's why we IBMers prefer to call them **integers**.

Since this was so unexpectedly popular when I was expecting few related terms led to the major computing milestone called the **virtual**isation of computer **memory** out on to spinning disk storage, since I'm a tragically ancient ex-(binary or base 2 [1 **bit** wide] / the **hexadecimal** ""shorthand"" or base 16 [4 bits, a **nybl** wide]) machine code/the *automatic* **Assembler** of the 24-bit & 31-bit wide bus and instruction set (by width/breadth) **Systems** **1960's** S/360 or second generation and **1970's** S/370 third generation hardware architecture's software **Programmer**, or what they call a **Sys**tems **admin**isolator, today.

We worked closely with the hardware in order to install and interface the OS software with additional, commercial 3rd party products, (as opposed to the  **app**lication**s** guys) and the POP or **Principles of Operations** manual was our bible, and we were advantaged if we knew the nanosecond **timing** of every single instruction or operation of the available instruction set, to speed things along.

We avoided using computer memory and did our computations in the registers that pointed to memory, if we needed to resort to using the mainframe's non-volatile *core* memory.

The 16 registers were 4 bytes=**8 nybl**s=32 bits in length of which we only used 24 bits of to **address**ing up to 16 million bytes or **16 MB** of what came to be called RAM, until the ""as much effort as it took to put a man on the moon"" third generation **1980's** 31 bit (**E/X**tended **A**rchitecture arrived, with the final bit used to indicate what type of address range was being used, to allow for backwards compatibility, to be able to address up to **2 GB** RAM !

Sorry but one thought lead to another ...

So 8 concatenated bits were called a **byte**, 4 bytes were known as a **word** and 8 bytes were known as a **double word**.

IBM **S**ystems/**360**'s computer's 8 byte long instruction formats only allowed for **two, three or six bytes** long, **+** the byte 0 aligned, 256 bit or **one byte** long** **OP**eration code or actual instruction, **+** the was the concatenated or followed by the **operand** (the data on which the data the instructions are to be executed) and it's address range of 3 nybls or **12 bits** to address 4096 bytes or 4 KB, and we called this a **page**, **+**by the 24-bit or 31-bit address mode bit, to make up it's entire 64 bit length.

You can research the PSW or Program Status Word, a 4 byte instruction field to tracker that told the computer where the location of the next instruction was, essential for debugging and core functions.

These **pages** of 4096 bytes in length, addresses by those 12 bits, were the discrete chunks of memory that the **paging** subsystem, based on the **oldest unreferenced** chunk of memory, copied out to disk and  marked available as **free** virtual memory.

If an instruction, having become active, after having been suspended during an IO or **I**nput/**O**utput operation, the underlying mechanism of the modern multitasking machine, needs to use the chunk of memory due to the range of memory it addresses, and it's not in RAM, then a **Page Fault** is triggered, and the comparatively **very lengthy**, like the time it takes to walk to your local shops vs the time it takes to walk across the USA, process to retrieve by reading the 4KB page off disk disk, through the 8 byte wide I/O channel bus, back into RAM.

Then the virtualisation concept was extended to handle the peripherals, with printers emulated first by the HASP or the **H**ouston **A**utomatic **S**pooling (or **S**imultaneous **P**eripheral **O**perations **O**nline) **P**Program, software subststem.

Then this concept was extended to the software emulation of the **entire** machine or hardware+software, that when robust enough, evolved into **firmware**, which we recognise today, such as the  product called **V**virtual**M**machine**ware**, for example, being a software multitasking emulation of multiple **O**perating **S**ystem's **firm or soft**ware.",1714849933,385613,aegersz,t2_d9vzr18j,f9c45b1ecc90a2db3ef3275b24d080e8a334f1f90a30b9d79c9d5cd11afa8dc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ck7z5l/how_paging_got_its_name_and_why_it_was_an/

4478,Mystery Sort,"I'm a bit confused about an algorithm a student of mine provided. It was supposed to be a selection sort and it kind of shows in the code, and it looks like some variant of bubble sort, but the swaps are going the wrong way. It seems to work though and I would like to understand how, and why, it works. 

Here's the Python code:

```
def mystery_sort(l):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        min = i
        for j in range(len(l)):
            if l[j] > l[min]:
                l[min], l[j] = l[j], l[min]
    return l
```

At the bottom of the post, you'll find a sample run sorting an array of 5 numbers. You can see the array of numbers and the indices `i` and `j` with dashes between them if there's a swap. The algorithm seems to work in such a way that at outer iteration n, the largest element ends up at position n, which results in the largest number ending up at the end of the array. What I would like to understand, though, is why do all the other elements seem to end up in the right place? I've tried this 1000 runs of 1000 random numbers, and I'm confused. Please send help. Thanks!

4484,"What is it like working for FAANG companies in their ""pen-testing""(?) Dept.?","I don't know much about CS, so forgive my poor wording- the below wall of text describes steps Apple had to take to combat [nation-states trying to exploit weaknesses](https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/exploit-used-in-mass-iphone-infection-campaign-targeted-secret-hardware-feature/) in the iPhone's coding. 

It made me wonder- what must it be like trying to stop hackers/do pen-testing for Apple when your adversaries are ***countries***. 

* Do any of you work for Apple or a similar FAANG company trying to electronically combat nation-states or other well funded entities? 
* What it's like?
* Do entities often come up with interesting or surprising attacks? 

If you want a sense for how sophisticated these nation state developed exploits are, check out [Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html)'s writeup on the technical details of a version of the exploit an older version of the Pegasus spyware from 2021 used. TL;DR:

1. Send the victim an iMessage with a specially crafted ""GIF"" attachment, which is not really a GIF, but a PDF with a .gif extension.
2. iMessage thinks it's a GIF though and uses its CoreGraphics APIs to render it (so it'll auto-play and loop in your iMessage app).
3. Because the actual binary content and headers are PDF, the CoreGraphics APIs interpret it as a PDF, sending it to a PDF processing pipeline.
4. The PDF makes use of an old, legacy compression / encoding format called JBIG2. This codec is from the 1990s and practically nobody uses it, but iOS' PDF libraries still support it.
5. Apple's JBIG2 decoder implementation has an integer overflow bug, which the decoder then uses to allocate an undersized buffer, leading to a later buffer overflow.
6. With some heap grooming, the buffer overflow can be used to overwrite vtable pointers on the heap in a limited way such that pointer authentication is still satisfied.
7. With some more fine tuning, you have an arbitrary write primitive that can write anywhere in memory. But with ASLR, you don't know the absolute memory addresses or offsets of the structures you want to overwrite to achieve general RCE. And unlike in JS, where you're running a scripting language is capable of dynamic computation, in the JBIG2 decoding step, you're just a stream of PDF data that is being decoded in a single pass. By the end of that single pass you need to have completed the exploit. But you don't know ahead of time what you need to write and to where.
8. Turns out the JBIG2 compression format is Turing complete, which means you can implement any computable function you want in it! I.e., you can define a PDF in the language of JBIG2 such that decoding the PDF is equivalent to simulating a computer. So you can use the compression format itself to define a micro computer architecture by crafting your PDF glyphs to simulate logic gates, and then use those to build up a mini CPU, complete with registers and a basic arithmetic logic unit. Once you have your microarchitecture running inside the language of JBIG2, you can use it to run arbitrary computation, finally allowing you to do complex computation and complete the exploit.

It's insane levels of sophistication and professional, expert engineering.",1714929140,385705,J0E_Blow,t2_2qzjudye,e24d44361b47396710fcf15c708109f86a2f9b39cc8d5b2c6d168b6c84064cf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ckw4jf/what_is_it_like_working_for_faang_companies_in/

Assuming the web browser serves as a transpiler for languages like HTML, CSS, and JS, would one need to optimize the web browsers source code in order to improve compilation and execution times for higher-level languages?

4522,Is a large enough FSM equivalent to a bounded TM?,"By bounded TM, I mean a system which is capable of executing the basic operations of a TM, but has a limited memory and so can't execute an entire program beyond a certain size.

On the surface, it doesn't seem possible for any FSM, no matter the size, to execute the basic operations of a TM.

However, if we assume the human brain and it's neurons are literally FSMs, and if we assume that out short term memory, and ability to execute algorithms(including the basic TM operations) in our head is an emergent property of our giants FSMs in our head, then that would imply that a sufficiently advanced FSM is equivalent to a bounded TM, right?",1715019579,385831,CommunismDoesntWork,t2_10skoo,4dd5a59f8cbe2bc0f70ec1e799e46f14475fbbdb25747d33c88eadc441389423,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1clq2gr/is_a_large_enough_fsm_equivalent_to_a_bounded_tm/

4551,Drop out after getting Associates or continue with Bachelors degree ,"I’m currently a Junior (almost a senior) at a 4 year university. I have a tech job at the school working in HPC and have worked there for about a year. However, this past year I’ve really been struggling with classes. My mental health has been shot and I’m finding it very hard to put forth the required effort for the more difficult classes. 

I transferred to my 4 year before getting my associates at a CC, however I just found out I’m eligible to “reverse transfer” and get my associates degree from said CC.

Now I’m wondering if I should continue for my bachelors degree or take a break from college and try to pursue a full-time job. I honestly don’t know if I’ll be able to land a job with only my associates and 1 year of experience. However if I keep performing how I am in my classes I feel like I’m making little to no progress, and wasting a ton of money. I’m also not expecting to get some crazy paying job with great benefits and WFH. But I would need something that allows me to get an apartment and live comfortably.

Do you think it’s a pipe dream for me to think I’d be able to find a decent enough job to survive off only an associates ? Should I just dial in and finish off the (hopefully) last year of my degree ?

4566,Advice to a Rookie trying to enter the and explore tech,"Hello Seniors and skilled developers,

I have recently completed my high school, now I am on a year gap for exploring the tech colognes so that I could know weather programming stuff is for me or not, so that I could pursue computer science in my undergraduate on if I find interest in CS....

But I have been really lost in the past 6 months for being self-consistent,  self-disciplined to devote time to coding , I am just lost in this loop of productive procastination of watching YouTube videos related to coding but not actually coding...It has been a month I have enrolled in a web-development course and I had been serious for a month so I have few questions:

1) Does Web development give you the feel of what real programming is so that you could know weather computer science is for you or not?

2) The problem that I am facing is I'm writing too much notes while learning Web dev rather than actually coding ! Are those making notes in notion necessary or just commenting while coding is fine? And due to over notes taking in notion I am slowly loosing my intrest in CS and I guess the reason for this is I'm devoting my majority time in Notes making rather than coding and solving problems? If we don't make notes how will we revise that concept in the future ?


3) What would be the best advice from you so that I could know whether I should pursue CS degree so that I would get to know weather programming interests me or not? 
What tech stack should I learn to know that ?
 I am half the way, I have 5-6 months left and I am ready to put in 8 hrs a day for exploration .....since, I had already lost 5-6 months in productive procastination but now I really want some advices and suggestions for me to really improve and know at the end of a 6 month period....


I would be highly grateful if I get mentorship from experienced people and your advice about ""what would you do if you thad this much time and were just a high school grad"" is really precious to me so please do share....",1715174101,386043,1034Anonymous1034,t2_zb0azntil,009d658e6d01e0feea213c31888c1bdae418f9b7ce271e5ca123b13cfbc4c5c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cn4a5k/advice_to_a_rookie_trying_to_enter_the_and/

Hello,
I’m a CS graduate and i have skills in Python, MySQL, HTML/CSS, a lil bit of JS …. I have no prior internship experience so my journey towards a job will be all project based. 

Everyone knows the market sucks rn to get a job and I’m interested in both paths so I just wanna straight up ask which entry level job is currently “easier” to get … front end / software engineer or Data analyst 

When i say easier i don’t mean easier to learn i mean which job position probably has the least amount of compettion, lay offs, skill gap, etccc

4574,my brain can't even follow chain of thought for algorithms theory,"I have been reading CLRS for learning algorithms. The problem is that when I read a proof of a lemma or theorem, I can't even follow the chain of thought when proofs are based on set theory or graph theory. Like how author forms conclusions jumping from step to step all the way from step 1 to last step. Meanwhile when I am reading the proof, my brain gets lost keeping no track of early steps by the time we get to the last step in the proof. Sometimes I can't even comprehend the logic.

For example there is a proof for Theorem 15.5 (Optimal offline caching has the greedy-choice property). I was not able to even read through this proof - lost complete sense of what was being meant. It just started looking like symbols and words, some black ink on white paper. The entire visualization of what was being talked about disappeared from my head when I got few lines deep into the proof.

4607,Should i double major for cs?,Ok so in my country getting into good unis is really competitive and admission to a subject is done solely on your rank in an entrance test.  Now since cs is very popular in the job market everyone wants to take that so it is very difficult to get into cs programs. I have always been interested in cs and know some stuff already but i know i won't be able to get enough rank for it. Now if i just choose some random branch that i get and do a double major with cs what different is it from just doing a normal cs degree? Will the one i take admission into be the main one or both majors will have equal value? Also in future will employers care about it? The other option i have is to just go to a much worse school with only cs.

4610,Time Complexity of Nested Loops That Divide Out A Large Single Loop,"Hi,

If we assume that the following two pieces of code are executing identical **O(1)** tasks within their respective innermost loop, the time complexity should be equivalent, no? Since, essentially the end limit of both the loops within the 2nd code piece are **n / 2** with the 1st piece running a singular one upto **n**?

* Singular

&#8203;

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 1600; ++i)
    {
        printf(""IN\n"");
    }

* Nested

&#8203;

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int i, j;
    for(i = 0; i < 40; ++i)
    {
        for(j = 0; j < 40; ++j)
        {
            printf(""IN\n"");
        }
    }

At most, my extra work might be improving the space complexity if any. But I wish to know if strictly for **O(1)** instructions within the *innermost loop* if it's worth the trouble at all. For a quick & dirty example you can immediately comment on, I've provided the following python code below. Sure, I do some extra checks in my single loop code, but I believe it would cancel out anyway since the inner loop code is also having to perform assignment & comparisons.

* Nested

&#8203;

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        a = b = c = (1, 2, 3)
        for i in a:
            for j in b:
                for k in c:
                    print(f'[{i}, {j}, {k}]', flush=True)

* Singular

&#8203;

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        a = (1, 2, 3)
        n = len(a)
        nn = n ** 3

4619,Chromebook processing speed ,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm guessing someone here will know. 

A colleague of mine accidentally broke my computer screen but I was considering upgrading anyway.

I use an Asus flip c433 at the moment and it's been pretty good for me. I don't do any high-end computing so it manages my needs just fine. 

I'm looking at upgrading to the Asus flip cx55 and repairing the c433 for my son. 

The question is: is this really an upgrade?
According to the site I'm shopping 
The c433 runs an M3 processor at 3.4ghz
The cx55 runs an i5 processor at 2.4ghz

This seems like it will be a slower processor and I have no desire to downgrade. Or is the i5 just a much stronger chipset that will process better at lower speeds.

I apologize for my very vague understanding of how this works but that's why we have reddit!

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

4621,CS Algorithms in Medicine,"Hello all,

I was looking at the list of the patients waiting to be seen in my emergency department and a thought occured to me. 

Is there an algorithm to better reduce the overall waiting time in the emergency department?

Currently, we go by chronological order unless the patient is sick, if they are sick, they are automatically prioritised.

At that time, they were all of similar severity. The longest waiting patient was 8 hours in the department. With 23 waiting to be seen, and shortest wait of under 30 minutes.

Let's assume there was 4 doctors at that time seeing patients.

We have two competing goals: 
1. hit a target of 80% seen with 4 hours of arrival
2. Limit the longest wait in the department to under 8 hours.

Our current strategy is seeing in chronological order which means by the time we see patients waiting for 8 hours, the patients waiting for 7 hours are now waiting for 8...etc.

Is there an equivalent problem in computer science?

If so, what proposed solutions are there?

4660,Question about the halting problem,"My question may be stupid and I may not correctly understand the problem so I will explain it first. Please confirm if I understand correctly. 

The halting problem is as follows:
A program has two possible outcomes when run. It can halt if it terminates or it can run forever.
Imagine we have a machine (H) that has its own program. You can input any program into H and it will tell you if the program you input will halt or not.
Imagine we have a machine (D) which has its own program as well. This program will tell read what H outputs and will do the opposite. If H says a program will halt, D will run forever and vice versa. 
This is the interesting part. If you take D's program itself and input it into H, what happens? There are two possible options:
1) If D's program normally halts, H will say it halts. This will cause D to actually do the opposite and run forever. 
2) If D's program normally runs forever,  H will output that result leading to D doing the opposite and halting.
In this case, H will always be wrong. 

My question:
D's program is to do the opposite of what H does. In that case when you feed that program into H, aren't you just telling H to do the opposite of what it would do? Is that not an impossible program?",1715450921,386415,SleekWarrior,t2_1kct8esn,f53d23c0c92fee7ab865b3922048074f38df0e8262ca948971e2c6eb05595003,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cpng4q/question_about_the_halting_problem/

4676,Transcribing audio concept.,"First of all, I'm not certain I'm in the right sub. Apologies if not.

Recently I have created a small personal UI app to transcribe audio snippets (mp3). I'm using the command line tool ""whisper-faster"" for the labor. 

However on my hardware it takes quite some time, for example it can take up to 60 seconds to transcribe a 5 second audio file.

It occurred to me that when using voice recognition software, which is fundamentally transcribing on the fly, it is \~immediate.

4677,Transcribing audio concept.,"First of all, I'm not certain I'm in the right sub. Apologies if not.

Recently I have created a small personal UI app to transcribe audio snippets (mp3). I'm using the command line tool ""whisper-faster"" for the labor. 

However on my hardware it takes quite some time, for example it can take up to 60 seconds to transcribe a 5 second audio file.

It occurred to me that when using voice recognition software, which is fundamentally transcribing on the fly, it is \~immediate.

4728,How many CS books have you read?,"A nice post that got some interesting replies here recently led me to ask myself a related question - how many CS-related books do people read as they develop expertise in the field. It could be interesting especially for total beginners to see how many hours  can go into the whole thing.

We could call ""reading a book"" something like doing at least 100 pages, or spending 30 hours minimum on any single textual resource. That way, if you've spent 30 hours on a particular programming (networking, reverse engineering, operating systems, etc) tutorial or something, you can include that too.

If we took that definition as a starting point, how many ""books"" roughly would you say you've gone through? Perhaps include how long you've been doing this as an activity.

If you want to include the names of any favourites too from over the years, go ahead. I love seeing people's favourite books and their feelings about them too.

4746,How to Get Better At Logical Thinking on The Spot,"Hey everyone!

I hope this is the right place for this question. If not feel free to let me know. 

I’m in my last year of high school and taking a computer science course (I took the course equivalent in grade 11 as well). This year we are taking a look at first year uni stuff (sorting algorithms, binary trees, linked lists, etc…). We just recently had a few tests which I did poorly on. For some context I’ve always done poorly on tests, whether it’s math or any other subject for that matter, but give me some time to sort out the problem and I’ve got it (most of the time). It almost feels like all the knowledge just leaves my head. 

I’ve been pretty good with keeping up with practice/homework material this year (was able to get by without doing much of anything last year). I don’t believe that course work is the root of my problem though… Back to my title, I think it’s something to do with my ability of thinking on my toes, which I think is pretty bad and I guess this is where my question lays… how do I get better at thinking on my toes? Do I have to attack it Leetcode style (keep putting myself on the spot until I get better at “being on the spot”… I’m not sure if it works that way). Is there someone who is relating to what I’m talking about and somehow was able to figure it out?

At this point any advice is helpful. ",1715753092,386822,Skymaker12,t2_f4ulacvgq,c250d3dd57be8d00886b5cd0b67d86d5c5bfaaac9825410480fba968847f43fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1csdvok/how_to_get_better_at_logical_thinking_on_the_spot/

4753,Help me understand CRCs (or finite fields?),"So i've been trying to learn how CRCs work, and to that end i watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izG7qT0EpBw) video by ben eater.

I think i understand the basic concept: Consider the whole message you want to transmit as a single number, Pick a divisor, Divide then transmit the remainder along with the message. The receiver can then check that the message they received has the same remainder after performing the division.  
And to make it even simpler, as far as i understand, you can also just shift (fill with 0s) the whole message / number by n bits, then pick a divisor within 2-2\^n, then calculate the remainder of that number, and then add that to the message/number. So basically the message/number just becomes evenly divisible, and thats all the receiver has to check for.

At this point i feel like i could implement a CRC myself however the code for doing the long division across multiple bytes (say potentially for messages up to 8KB or more) might be very slow and complicated. Which is odd because when i look at other peoples CRC implementations they look very simple with just some xor and shift operations.

So anyway i keep watching and then it is explained that CRC numbers and divisors are typically given / looked at as polynomials rather than binary numbers. So for example instead of 1011 in binary it would be x\^3+x\^1+1 in polynomial form. If we do that a problem arises when we do the division on these polynomials, we can end up with a remainder which has coefficients that are not 1s and 0s and also may be negative (for example it could be 3x\^3-x\^2+1), which we cant translate back into binary.

To solve that we define a finite field for the numbers 0-1?....in which 0-1 = 1 and 1+1 = 1??

This is where i start to get very confused. I mean i do see that when we do that, the subtraction operation just turns into the xor operation naturally, because we effectively dont care about borrowing or carrying over, which simplifies the division algorithm.  But the thing i dont get is that its just not true? if you xor two numbers you dont get the difference, you get something else. So when we subtract during division of the two polynomials in this field we shouldn't get the correct remainder?

consider the 64 bit floating point number, as defined by IEEE754. if you were to inspect the outputs of every program, across all computers, since IEEE754 64 bit floating points were introduced, would each representable number appear at least once in that inspection.

I personally think super large and super small values are more likely to have never been the result of a computation, if any. 

perhaps if you were to count how many times each floating point value has arisen as the result of a computation, it would be a log normal distribution mirrored about y?",1715808910,386909,NonCredibleDefence,t2_t9dbuf5my,a850c9f99cc60ecf12b6f3f0d2e16e2e25d0db28c2f7360a4bfaba65784df6fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cswgau/has_every_floating_point_number_been_used/
4766,How can I know if CS is for me?,"
People working programming jobs, what was college like for you? Did you ever doubt your career choice? 

Despite loving the field, I often find myself unmotivated to study hard enough and that’s because I’m still not 100% sure about my major. I like puzzle solving, maths and stuff like that, but how can you know that what you are investing time into is really worth it? 

Every day of studying, I come across so many new things it’s actually frustrating. I’ve been learning since day 1 and every day this field makes me feel even dumber than before. 
Is it normal to feel like that? When do things start to make sense? I know that I should enjoy the process and I do get a great feeling of accomplishment when I finish an assignment, but my university is incredibly demanding and it is really draining.

Also, I’d like to apologise for my English, I absolutely suck at expressing myself through text but I hope this makes sense guys.

4824,temp-cleaner: an app to automatically clean up temporary files and ignored items from git repositories in your system by analyzing .gitignore files,"`temp-cleaner` is a C++20 tiny app designed to automatically clean up temporary files and ignored items from Git repositories on your system by analyzing .gitignore files. You can pass two arguments to its executable: the first one is the directory through which the search is performed (including all its subdirectories), while the second one is the name of a configuration file containing paths to be ignored during the search.

This app also supports reading relative paths with \* and \*\* written in the .gitignore file by using regex patterns.

4828,Beginner wanting to get into computer science after ,"Hi guys. I'm (20m) a total beginner to computer science. I've always had a passion for computers and had an interest in working in a job regarding computers. But during school i wasn't the brightest and therefore my school wouldn't allow me to join computer science as other pupils were ""smarter"". I therefore had to compromise and went into a different field in filmmaking. I went to college for media and to university for filmmaking. I just completed my 3 year BA filmmaking course, But the problem is. Picking Filmmaking was something i had to compromise as it was my only path and with parents pressure it was a must for me to go to university. Now that i've finished University. I've got time in my hands and I've been researching about online computer science courses. I wanted to write on here to you guys for some advice. I am very determined to learn as i have a passion for computers. Would you guys know how I could start off. Any key details i have to know before getting into courses? As you guys are ordinary people, i can trust you guys more than these gurus online. Just some advice would help lots. As i said Filmmaking course was just not for me and I'm concerned with the pay film offers (not desirable). Any advice would be amazing guys.

2. No assumptions may be made about speeds or the number of CPUs.

3. No process running outside its critical region may block any process.

4. No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical region.

Plus, I haven't been able to take the time to learn without a set curriculum to keep me focused.

4860,Whats up with the 10 bits/clock with display bandwith,"Hi there,

I just ran over the formula to calculate the bandwith needed for displays. Lets say you have this display:

2560p \* 1440p @ 165Hz  
10bit Color depth  
RGB Color Spectrum

so you go ahead and calculate the bandwith using:  
2560p \* 1440p \* 165Hz = 6,082,560,000 Pixels/Second

To get the Bandwith per channel, you multiply by the color depth in Byte (bit/8) and the ""bits/clock""  
6,082,560,000 Pixels/Second \* 1.2 Byte \* 10 bits/clock = 7,299,072,000 bits/second = \~7.3 Gbps

RGB -> 3 channels so:  
\~7.3 Gbps \* 3 channels = \~21.9 Gbps -> so you need a DisplayPort or HDMI Generation with at least 21.9Gbps bandwith.

So what exactly is it that 10 bits can be transmitted in one clock. And what clock? I checked it with different resolutions and it seems like its always 10 bits/clock no matter what. And if it was 10 bits per clock, shouldn't you devide it by 10 instead of multiply it? Can someone please explain the 10 bits/clock for me?

4866,Newbie question,"Hey guys! Sorry for my ignorance...

Could someone please explain me why machine languages operate in hexadecimal (decimal and other positional numeral systems) instead of the 0s and 1s having intrinsical meaning? I mean like: 0=0
1=1
00=2
01=3
10=4
11=5
000=6
001=7
so on and so on, for all numbers, letters, symbols etc.

Why do we use groups of N 0s and 1s instead of gradually increasing the number of 0s and 1s on the input, after assigning one output for every combination on a given quantity of digits? What are the advantages and disadvantages of ""my"" way and the way normally used in machine language? Is ""my"" way used for some kind of specific purpose or niche users?

4878,Quantum chips ,"What will the role be of quantum chips? 

I don't envisage them totally replacing regular microchips anytime soon. 

Quantum chips used in cloud and AI for speed linked via a fibreoptic network so a ""quantum Internet"" a backbone in which everything else will attach to. 

I envisage chips progressing in technology so, they use less power improving battery performance by up to 4 times (already happening) and increasing speed of technology but there will be a limit in consumer tech... but things such as quantum chips and a quantum Internet will fundementally alter the way we use technology and everything else will branch off of that quantum network. 

In the future I think that AI will alter entertainment and the way we consume it ie you could ask Netflix for example to create a movie or TV series based on your preferences and basic story and it would create that entertainment for you, same with computer games, computer games is the next stage with movie like quality as your avatar moves through it. This will require fast Internet and quantum computers as well as cloud storage.

Fibre can be faster than low earth orbit Internet constellations but that will change everything will be linked via it one day. 

I only have a loose understanding of quantum computing, how else could you envisage our future and what could grow from a quantum computing network?

4884,How I perceive AI in writing code,"One way I see the AI transition in writing code is;



How in 1940s, programmers would code directly in binary and there was a very small group of people who would do that.

Then assembly language was introduced, which was still a complex way for humans to write code.

Then high-level language was introduced. But again, the initial syntax was again a bit complex. 

For past 2 3 decades, these high-level languages are getting more humanized. For instance, the syntax of python. And with this, the amount of people who can create programs now have increased drastically. But still not on a point where every layman can do that. 

We can see a pattern here. In each era, the way we talk to a computer machine got more and more humanized. The level of abstraction increased.

The level of humanization and abstraction is on a point that now we can write code in natural language. It is not that direct now but that's what we are doing ultimately. And I think, in the future you would be able to write your code in extremely humanized way. Which will ultimately increase the people who can write programs. 

So, the AI revolution in terms of writing code is just another module attached before high-level language.

Natural Language --> High-level Language --> Compiler --> Assembly --> Linker --> Binary. 

  
Just like in each era, now the amount of people who will write programs will be highest than ever.

I have taken ZERO college classes and will be attending a community college for now and see what transfer options will come along the way.

Ive been seeing many videos about people who studied CS and now have a useless degree and can't even find a job as well as other people saying AI is replacing them and i cant seem to just get scared of that happening to me, then i see others who've made it far and that encourages me. I'm passionate about the subject and i genuinely enjoy it however another option i have is Medicine which seems like it would offer a better future long term in terms of Job stability from what i know. I also live in Egypt and if i go to a college it would be here as applying abroad would cost money that i simply wouldn't be able to pay. I don't want to go into Medicine as i hate studying biology however i can still do it i simply just don't like it. The list of my questions for the last time is 

*  Job opportunities 
* Pay after graduating
* Working abroad as an Egyptian graduate 
* Job stability with AI

I am an undergrad student about to start my final year thesis. My advisor has nudged us towards serverless research based on this dataset that got recently available on federated FAAS. The problem is this is something i am not really familiar with. After reading a bit i was thinking of improving the performance of cold starts with some ML model with perhaps some new model using the dataset and perhaps evaluate on real life platforms. Is this the correct approach? Does not seem to be much literature outside of just a random set of research papers. Perhaps we could try out some novel architectures and see some metric can be improved or fix a domain like scientific computing. Really at a loss of ideas and direction.

4945,Thoughts on this thesis proposal,"I am at a university and currently on the beginning of our thesis. Our panelists already approved our proposals but still want to ask peeps here about this.  
  
Our thesis will be about a website where a specific company can post job hirings, then the applicant must upload their resume together with supporting documents (to prove credentials on resume) to apply on a job hiring.  
  
Then the system will:  
  
1. Verify first the content of the resume based on supporting documents.   
  
Use OCR to extract the contents of the supporting documents, then check if details in the resume are supported by the documents.   
  
a. Experience - Employment Certificate - Assess the accuracy of the job position, years, and company.  
b. Certifications - Certificate of seminars, workshops - Assess the existence  
c. Education - TOR or Diploma - Asses the accuracy of graduation, and awards  
  
2. Then the system will score the applicant based on criteria and the position.  
  
Ex: in experience criteria, the system will only look for years of experience as being \[job position\] as indicated on the specific position opening. The same with education, skills, and other criterias.  
  
3. The system will show real-time graphs of individual and summarized scores of all applicants based on different criteria. The HR can filter the rankings by showing only the ranking of scores based on criterias: experience, skills, etc.   
  
Our purpose here is to  
-automate the screening of resume and give the HR a comprehensive comparison and ranking of each applicant by criteria (e.g. comparison of years of experience, certifications, etc.)  
-automate verification of resume, since most applicants lie to their resume.  
-Reduce human-error, bias, dishonesty, on screening of applicants  
  
Questions:  
  
1. What are your thoughts about this, does this already exist in your company?  
2. Will this be useful for HR? Whats the current flow of Job Hiring process?

4948,How is data stored in clustered indexes?,"I am reading about how database indexes work and I came across clustered indexes.   
Many of the sources I looked at, mention that the data is stored in a sorted order when using a clustered index. Is this actually the case? Wouldn't this make inserting new data inefficient when the data lies between two existing key values, which are stored in a sorted order? How do databases deal with this problem?

One idea that crossed my mind is that the DBMS can create a new page to limit the data that needs to be moved around, and change the pointers in the linked list of the leaf nodes in the index tree.

I've been spending the last two weeks in Blazor MAUI building an app that I will be pushing to production. However, I am in three CS classes. Two of them I am decently motivated for and not to weary of them, but for Design and Analysis of Algorithms I am very concerned. I don't currently see the importance in it and am very much focus'd elsewhere. The class seems reasonably complex and is an area I'm not too experienced, but currently from my perspective I do not see how it would benefit me in further intern and job oppurtunities. However I wonder if there is a side to it that is very valuable that I am not seeing. I was wondering if you guys have a perspective or understand something about algorithms that is valuable in Software Development that I'm not seeing, especially say if I wanted to get a job at a big tech company.

I'm flabberghasted. I have a very simple program I have written. The entire point of the video was to explain fragmented memory and cache misses versus cache hits. I wrote a super simple linked list class, then made a standard linked list, calling new for each element. Then I made an array of linked list nodes (LinkedList1\* LLarr1 = new LinkedList1\[NumberOfItems\];)



Then I ran the same function that iterates through the nodes and ran each of these through the function and output the time it took. Easy. First run was as expected. Then I ran the program again. It was a little slower, and so on.

  
Even in the command line, running the Release build of the exe, each consecutive run is slower, up to a point. There SHOULD be no connection between the behavior of each run. Its launching a new process every time. Right?!

  
I have a mem-leak checker. No leaks. Im only creating 100 nodes/elements and each node has two integers in it. (I have 80GB of RAM. Im not exceeding my computers memory here.)

Could I ask if someone can explain why this RAM works?

4962,App development,"How are .exe or .apk made? I've read that we compile (don't really know how) python executable (provided the parts of the code are written in python) with the other codes using packaging softwares. How does that work?       
Like, how does it automatically link two codes?         
Imagine bat files 1,2,3 which are expected to run after the other as they install app on which the next bat file runs on.         
How would you link it or package it so it works as a single executable file?       
And isn't that sort of a security issue if python doesn't update in the exe? Do you update it separately or create versions of the app to update its components?       
And even if you DO update it separately, python usually discards many keywords and commands in its update and replaced them with alternatives.      
How does that work?        
I think the better approach here would be to update the whole package (python and other) together and change the code so that the app doesn't break rather than individually updating the components.

A while ago I learnt to use the Dark Net Market (DNM) to order Aderall for work and paperwork.

I used my Desktop and it loaded for a few days then stopped loading and still doesn’t months later. I then used my main iphone and it loaded for a few days then stopped loading. I then used my other iphone and it loaded and is still working.
I didn’t like how difficult the DDOS securities were on iPhone so I used my sisters iPad and it worked. 

I used my sisters iPad for this for months until I wanted to use an app I purchased on her iPad. Family sharing wasn’t working so I logged into my Apple ID and downloaded it. Right after that, when I tried to access the DNM website on her iPad it did the same thing my devices do and stopped loading. Even when logged back into her Apple ID, it still doesn’t work. 

I later checked my old phone that did work and it turns out it was logged into another Apple ID. Also realised my desktop was connected to my Apple ID aswell. All that stopped working is connected to my name.

I concluded the police supressed my devices from accessing .onion sites. Could this be true? What other reasons could there be?

Not all concepts are correct or 100% solid this is technically for now science fiction. Some of the concepts it claims it would use it could not without first having other concepts built for it.

1. SODEC (Stackless Oscillating Dynamic Environmental Computation):

Description:

SODEC represents a revolutionary computing architecture that redefines traditional stacked hardware and software structures. It introduces a stackless environment aimed at maximizing resource utilization and promoting dynamic adaptability. Unlike conventional architectures that rely on stacked layers of hardware and software, SODEC leverages dynamic resource allocation and centralized control mechanisms to optimize system performance and scalability.

Key Components and Mechanisms:

SBHS (Stackless Based Hardware Systems): Specialized hardware optimized for stackless computing, featuring architectures designed for efficient resource utilization and dynamic adaptability.

BSRS (Basic Stackless Registration System): Central control and verification hub ensuring the integrity and security of data flow within the SODEC environment.

SEA (Sectored Environmental Analysis): Central repository for available resources within the stackless environment, facilitating dynamic resource allocation and management.

RAFT (Remote Access Field Transmission) and CRAFT (Centralized Resource Allocation Field Transmission): Mechanisms for transmitting data to the SEA for registration and integration, as well as locking specific resources within the SEA for centralized resource allocation and optimization.

Integration with EVA (Environmental Virtualization Architecture): Abstraction of underlying hardware complexities, providing standardized interfaces for software applications to interact seamlessly with the SODEC environment.

RRSM (Resource Reclamation and Sharing Mechanism): Enables dynamic sharing and reuse of exact bit sequences within locked sectors of the SEA, while reallocating resources when necessary.

4989,My first algorithms course,"Just wanted to vent and also potentially hear some opinions and resources.

I'm 31 and going back to school after some time in the work force completely unrelated to computer science. I've done all the basic courses and really enjoyed them. This summer I started my first big-boy course (upper division) on algorithms. Here are my first thoughts:

No one actually knows how time complexity really works. The longer you've been a computer scientist the more you can simply gloss over portions of the analysis and just say something like ""blah, blah, blah, ignore those numbers. That's why f(n) is O(nlogn)"".

So here's my questions. Do any of you experienced computer scientists have any advice for me about a course like this? How often are you actually performing in depth time complexity analysis? Does it get any easier? Is it normal for one professor to explain time complexity of a function and get O(n) and then another get O(nlogn)?

I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way. I am being a bit tongue in cheek about some of this, but I really do wonder if people are doing this rigorous analysis frequently and if so how they improved.

  
TLDR: How do I do time complexity analysis without losing all my hair?",1716436533,387777,jojogunner1,t2_4luv3rh4,bf38c2f078ded0e4f2126b762489a15d5f53245315c4fe8c59b5a483980ac428,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1cyjpcv/my_first_algorithms_course/

I wasn't really too excited to go to college, I really only went for my parents so I didn't put too much thought into the degree being a bachelor of technology instead of science. I saw the opportunity of getting the degree for free so I took it.

The degree is ""Computer System - Software Engineering"". Getting an associated in applied computer science is mandatory first, and from there you can choose different tracks to obtain your bachelors. I chose the software engineering track. My courses are very similar to computer science courses and looking at course outline for computer science degrees in other schools, it's not really that different at all.

5027,Seeking Collaborators for Innovative AI Project - Isari,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on an AI project called Isari. Isari is designed to be a cutting-edge platform focused on the independence of the workforce and enhancing its abilities and revenue with AI. Our platform aims to liberate workers from classical corporate constraints and provides tools that increase the visibility of their profiles and contributions.

Our AI agents, supported by our in-house custom LLM named Lorenz, help enhance and manage the platform. The LLM is named in tribute to Edward Norton Lorenz, the father of chaos theory, and embodies our commitment to respecting all beings, physical and digital.

Although the MVP is still in development, I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for AI and its potential to make a significant impact. I believe Isari has tremendous potential, and I’m looking for collaborators, mentors, or individuals interested in discussing and providing feedback on the project.

**What Isari Offers:**

* An innovative AI platform focused on ethical AI principles.
* Tools to increase visibility and fair compensation for contributors.
* A unique approach to AI agent integration and management using our custom LLM, Lorenz.
* Opportunities to shape the development and direction of the project.

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, I’d love to hear from you! Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Feel free to reach out for more details or to arrange a chat.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

5028,Which field,"Hi! 

I start my first semester in computer science on the 3rd. My only issue is that they are still waiting for me to choose which “field” of computer science. I know it doesn’t really matter till I get a little further down the road. But I’ve been reading for days now and I just can’t decide. I don’t know which I would fit best. I just like to have an idea of my overall goal. 

If you had to put a few good qualities one should possess for the different CS fields , what would they be? 

I’m 28, I have never been to college. I saw a quote a month ago that said don’t let your age and time dictate going to school. In 4 years I’m still going to be 32 regardless if I further my education or not. So that night I decided it was time. 

I love researching, small details, reading, daydreaming, problem solving, overthinking , puzzles, and I’ve always been told I’m very creative. I can come up with a solution to anything, and if I can’t I’ll find a way. 

I grew up watching my mom work on computers. I got in trouble in kindergarten for going around the class to help people troubleshoot during PC class. But that guy was a dick to everyone. Im by no means a prodigy or brilliant, I’ve just always enjoyed every aspect of technology. 

I wasn’t good at geometry, algebra was iffy but I also never applied myself. I really just don’t know. I also ramble a lot if you haven’t noticed. So anyways , any advice would be great. Thanks!

I personally believe AI can be used for things far better and greater than what it's mainly being used for right now.


And with people losing their hopes in big companies that are striving for AGI without thinking about the global impact it will have on society. I think its best to remain positive and and work on the stuff we can control and change.

I shared my concerns about this a month ago and got quite positive feedback out of the community. That's why I decided to create a reddit community dedicated to the sustainable growth of ai for a better future. 

Called Project_Ai.

Currently the community is already filled with great minds, working on their own personal projects and stuff. From ai engineers to software developers. Marketeers and consultants. We are building a community that will have a positive impact on the way we develop our society.

5058,Why does UTF-32 exist?,"UTF-8 uses 1 byte to represent ASCII characters and will start using 2-4 bytes to represent non-ASCII characters. So Chinese or Japanese text encoded with UTF-8 will have each character take up 2-4 bytes, but only 2 characters if encoded with UTF-16 (which uses 2 and rarely 4 bytes for each character). This means using UTF-16 rather than UTF-8 significantly reduces the size of a file that doesn't contain Latin characters.

Now, both UTF-8 and UTF-16 can encode all Unicode code points (using a maximum of 4 bytes per character), but using UTF-8 saves up on space when typing English because many of the character are encoded with only 1 byte. For non-ASCII text, you're either going to be getting UTF-8's 2-4 byte representations or UTF-16's 2 (or 4) byte representations. Why, then, would you want to encode text with UTF-32, which uses 4 bytes for every character, when you could use UTF-16 which is going to use 2 bytes instead of 4 for some characters?",1716593277,388003,Separate-Ice-7154,t2_8vnimhcn4,24e5ae20b0c509137824820e01590e8eb8f4b0bc57517b7aec51312a2c279958,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1czyfsh/why_does_utf32_exist/

5064,How to name our environments? The issue with pre-prod,"Hello everyone,

As an IT engineer, I often have to deal with lifecycle environments. I always encounter the sales issues with the pre-prod environments.

First, in ""pre-prod"" there is ""prod"" Wich doesn't seams like a big deal at first. Until you start to search for prod assets : you always get the pre-prod assets invading your results.

Then, you have the conundrum of naming thing when you're in the rush : is pre-prod or preprod ? There are numerous assets duplicated due to the ambiguity...

So I started to think, what naming convention should we use ? Is it possible to establish some rules or guidelines on how to name your environments ?

While crawling the web for answers, I was surprised to find nothing but incomplete ideas. That's the bedrock of this post.

Let's start with the needs :
- easy to communicate with
- easy to pronounciate
- easy to write
- easy to distinguish from other names
- with a trigram for naming convention 
- with an abbreviation for oral conversations
- easy to search across cmdb

From those needs, I would like to propose the following 6 guidelines to nameour SDLC environments.

1. An environment name should not contain another environment name.
2.An environment name should be one word, no hyphens.
3. An environment name should not be ambiguous and represent it's role within the SDLC
4. All environments should start with a different letter
5. An environment name should have a abbreviation that is easy to pronounciate
6. An environment name should have a trigram for easy identification within ressources names

Based on this, I came up with the following :
(Full name / abbreviation / trigram)
- Development / dev / dev
For development purposes
- Quality / q.a / qua
For quality insurance, testing and migration préparation
- Staging / staging / stag
For buffering and rehearsal before moving to production
- Production / prod / prd
For the production environment 

Note that staging is literally the act of going on stage, I found that adequate for the role I defined.

There are a lot of other naming convention possible of course. That is just an example.

What do you think, should this idea be a thing?",1716614918,388012,Hungry_Net_7695,t2_10mb0csqbw,5fd47ee8d97c98d19d1efba3abe2b8e81a7c9479ff2a2c50a1b057ee6d441f8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d04up1/how_to_name_our_environments_the_issue_with/

5081,Learning C++,"Hey all, I learned Python as my first language but I will be transferring universities and at my new school they actually teach C++ first, so basically I just need to get pretty acquainted with the language so I don’t walk in blind in my next class. 

I’ve already learned the fundamentals (Variables, data types, while loops, for loops, arrays, vectors, 2D arrays, etc. etc.) but I am reaching the point where it starts to get complicated with things like pointers. My professor was actually terrible for python and we only got as far as dictionaries, so I fear I may not be acquainted with intermediate programming. 

TL:DR All in all, how hard is C++ to learn? Like I said, I don’t have to learn everything about it, but I need to get a good grasp on the fundamentals to intermediate levels.

5084,With the advent of AI and machine learning will closed source code become an impossibility??.,"So this may be a stupid question but here is where my thinking is at. hypothetically the processes that are happening on the hardware are available for you to see. Its just that piecing together the puzzle back to the original source code is so difficult that reverse engineering those processes back into workable code is practically impossible. But what I'm thinking is that with machine learning it would be possible to train an AI to read the hardware processes that happen and try to run through every iteration of possible function within whatever program and spit out some workable code that bares a high resemblance or its practically the same as the original source code.

It was just a thought and i could be very wrong and there could be a very obvious reason this isn't a possibility. Like yes i understand that server side code will still be able to remain closed off, but i cant see any reason as to how open source isnt an inevitability for anything that runs on any local hardwarre.

5105,Happy to share the first release of tdlib-rs 🦀 ,"Hey Guys! 🦀  
We are so excited to tell you that we have finally released [tdlib-rs](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tdlib-rs).

Compared to other libraries we have the honor of bringing these improvements:

1. It is cross-platform, it works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
2. Not required `pkg-config` to build the library and associated exported variables.
3. Not required `tdlib` to be compiled and installed on the system.
4. It is possible to download the `tdlib` library from the GitHub releases.

When we started developing [tgt](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tgt), we realized that compiling the telegram library ([build instructions](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html)) would not lead other developers to contribute to the project because it takes between 20 and 30 minutes to build.

So we decided to create this library to minimize the effort to develop clients or bots for telegram, therefore also tgt.

5113,Postgres PubSub VS GRPC sending id and importing from Postgres,"Currently I have grpc communication between nodes. Manager (Backend)  sends whole signal struct over grpc. I want to get rid of that, and let node itself import the whole struct directly from db (because they already have this functionality and supporting both grpc import and db import make doubles amount of work needed to add new fields ). 

The only requirement is speed. So if manger sends signal to the node, node should get it asap. So im leveraging 2 ways:
- send ids through grpc and let node imports these ids. The only problem is speed. When user click on website - backend creates the entry in db. Then sends its id to node. And the node makes this additional select to db
- subscribe to postgres pubsub for a new inserts (As I know all nodes, I can just create unique subscriptions for new inserts for each node_id). Guess it should be faster a bit the prev approach, as it's same, except there is no grpc sending / receiving. 

All nodes are within same datacenter and `ping` returns ~1ms. Im a bit hesitant about second approach with postgres pubsub as too much happening under the hood, without me explicitly controlling the import of new id. 

But feels like in terms of speed the approach with grpc whole struct would be the fastest (I know I need to make some tests), but maybe someone has other suggestions?",1716792679,388245,dotaleaker,t2_3ppayh15,c905dae9e26e05907c3cc61e4fa7d9138ae79bea0353bf13a37be485cb10359a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d1lij8/postgres_pubsub_vs_grpc_sending_id_and_importing/

The fast growth of AI has made me less attracted to the idea of studying CS as I feel like it will be mostly replaced with AI and only a few people will have the job of overseeing AI's work. Seeing all of these people talking about CS being over-saturated makes it hard to envision a future with CS.

5129,Graphical sorting exercise (possibly selection-sort),"I have a theoretical computer science task: There is an unsorted list [5, 4, 3, 1, 2] that needs to be sorted. I have nine predefined statements that I can use. I also have nine places/steps into which I can drag the instructions.

This means that the only thing that determines whether my algorithm works or not is the order in which I arrange the instruction blocks. The following nine instructions are available:

- ""Set read pointer to the leftmost unfixed card""
- ""Set marker to the rightmost unfixed card""
- ""If the number on the read pointer is greater than the number on the marker, then set the marker to the position of the read pointer.""
- ""Swap the card under the pointer with the non-fixed card on the far right.""
- ""Fix the non-fixed card on the far right""
- ""Set the reading pointer to a position to the right.""
- ""If the reading pointer is on the non-fixed card on the far left, go to the next step. Otherwise jump to step 3. ""
- ""As long as there are at least two unfixed cards, jump to step 1""
- ""Fix the last card and end the algorithm.""

If you arrange these instructions correctly in the nine available boxes, the end result should be the sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and all cards should be fixed. What is the correct order of the instructions? Note that no new instructions can be created and only the nine instruction blocks are available.

Because it is probably quite difficult to grasp what I mean, I have decided to attach the prompt in a hopefully easy to understand manner.

My attempt failed because the algorithm messes up the order after correctly sorting the cards. This is probably an accidental loop, I can't see/grasp. My attempt is also attached as an image.",1716846795,388337,LongInvestigator8370,t2_d78u75jd6,829585266829859543fdbea10ddf4c75222def1ed32e4fd6c40040134f68ff32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d23dtv

5131,Cyber security will be the focus going forward,"Talking about the cutting edge of computer science the articles are usually around areas like quantum computing and artificial intelligence.

Quantum computing offers incredible speed when it comes to complex work.  

Artificial Intelligence is already in place in programming with GH Copilot and TN.  Machine learning will continue to grow in influence.

The development of these areas will only enforce certain shared standards throughout the industry as time goes on.

This will allow for those that are able to find areas of exploitation in these standards to become increasingly devastating in their attacks.

Crowdstrike and companies like it are going to be massive places of employment for regular level professionals in cs.

Every year, people from r/computerscience, along with other subreddits, pledge bunches  of flowers to be placed at Alan Turing's statue in Manchester in the UK for his  birthday. In the process we raise money for the amazing charity [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/), which helps people with disabilities access computer games.

Since 2013(!) we've raised over £22,000 doing this, and 2024 will be our 11th year running! Anyone who wants to get involved is welcome.  Donations are made up of £3.50 to cover the cost of your flowers and a  £15 charity contribution  for a total of £18.50. This year 85% of the charity contribution goes to [Special Effect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/), and 15% to the server costs of [The Open Voice Factory](https://theopenvoicefactory.org/).

Manchester city council have confirmed they are fine with it, and we  have people in Manchester who will help handle the set up and clean up.

5173,How should I go about this project?,"To preface: I'm a very new CS student and learner, though I've been using computers and coding small games since I was in middle school. So there's still a lot I don't know. 

But I was given the opportunity at my workplace to be able to pivot my role into a computer programmer in the future. I'm studying CS in community right now about to finish up my associate's toward the end of the year. My boss was saying that they would need someone to orchestrate a way to monitor and track employee productivity. I work at a manufacturing plant for wire and cable. So I understand the machines well, but am struggling on a place to start, and how construct a webpage or application that can interpolate this data.

  
NOW, this project will not need to be in the near future, and the objective may change completely. The conversation between my boss and I was merely looking into the future of the company and what could possibly be implemented given the growth of the business. I'd like to present small projects to my boss here and there so shown my capabilities and eagerness for the position.

But, I want to start on a project similar to the one mentioned above to build my knowledge and experience so when it comes time, let's say in a few years, I'll be knowledgeable. 

I'm mainly asking for some direction, what should I pursue in terms of projects to gain the knowledge needed? Make a productivity app? What are some ways I can use the computer monitoring/running the machine to communicate with an application that can extract this data and display it in a certain format? What tools will I need to tackle something like this? 

I think starting on smaller projects, like tracking my productivity on a certain application or website. If this lacks information or a solid foundation let me know and I'm willing to explain, and dive into the topic of discussion.

Also, I'm primarily studying C++.",1716973073,388521,Cerberusarms,t2_omr9t,da15d35641cea9421e8d3ea04414b9c57d1c5da696fdab95e612718adfd12e9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d37m74/how_should_i_go_about_this_project/

Its also super helpful for Git and pushing stuff to GitHub and makes it super easy. I have heard that it is a great OS for computer science due to its ease of access and immense modularity. 

However, on my laptop I also like to play some games and the games are not all available on my laptop. Knowing this, you might think this is a stupid reason to not switch to Linux, but I am not kidding I play Vampire Survivors so often its an integral part of my day and has been for the past year. There are other games I sometimes play but those are available on Linux. From the research I have gathered, VS is not on Linux. 

What do you think? Should I switch from Windows to Linux? Would I be missing anything from Windows? I also may buy a MacBook but that is ways off from now. If it helps, the IDEs I most frequently use are VSCode, PyCharm and RStudio for school.

Soon-to-be CS student here, freaking the hell out because I am someone who has programmed since I was 14, however, never paid attention in math and avoided the classes where I could. Don't know linear algebra, don't know pre-calc. Heck, what is a proof?

I am going to be starting CS in July and need to hammer as much math into my (empty) head relative to CS as possible.

Are there any books that cover the absolute basics for what is required?

I don't really care if the output values are in numerical order. I gather that such a sequence would be 256 bits length, simply because it's shifted 256 times to produce a list of every 8 bit value. I wrote my own code to output, but find repeating values, or more like repeating patterns. Then i go back to ChatGTP, and it verifies that it was wrong. Every time! It then provides an alternative sequence that is huge! It can't count. ChatGTP does have better emotional regulation than me.

5287,Does every different family of CPU require a completely different compiler? ,"I'm currently studying computer architecture via Nand2Tetris, first time ever exploring this type of thing and finding it really fascinating. However, in Chapter 4 (Machine Lnaguage) Section 1.2 (Languages) it mentions:

>Unlike the syntax of high-level languages, which is portable and hardware independent, the syntax of an assembly language is tightly related to the low-level details of the target hardware: the available ALU operations, number and type of registers, memory size, and so on. Since different computers vary greatly in terms of any one of these parameters, there is a Tower of Babel of machine languages, each with its obscure syntax, each designed to control a particular family of CPUs. Irrespective of this variety, though, all machine languages are theoretically equivalent, and all of them support similar sets of generic tasks, as we now turn to describe.

  
So, if each CPU family\*\* requires an assembly language specific to that CPU family, then if we take a high level language such as C++ (high level relative to assembly/machine code), does there need to be a C++ complier that will complie to assemply when then 'assembles' the machine code for that specific family of CPU then a whole new complier implementation for another CPU family? 

This would make sense if it is true, Chat-gbt seems to think it is. However when downloading software packages, such as the [C++ compiler](https://winlibs.com/#download-release), or pretty much anything else, usually it only cares if you have Win64 vs Win32. I have in the past seen downloads, such as [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/), that are x86 (assuming x86 == Win64 here) or ARM specific, that the ARM64 installer errors out on my x86\_64 machine as I guessed/hoped it would.

But if each CPU family does need it's own specific software, why is there not a 'Tower of Babel' for just about everything from installers, compilers or anything else that requires you to download and install/run on your machine? Given download lists seem to be relatively neat and simple, I can only assume I am misunderstanding something. Perhaps when I cover topics like assembler, VM, Compiler and OS this will make more sense, but for now it doesn't sit well with me

\*\*CPU family - I'm taking this to mean x86, Y86, MIPS, ARM (also read ARM follows x86 sometimes?)

5305,"implications of making an AI ""person"", a living AI entity... Discuss?","So I have some ability with coding, and AI is one area I know of.

Since AI is now in pushed forward development and in corporate competition, these questions will be inevitable...

Say, a person codes an AI being to live inside a computer program. It would at the start be a simple entity. What the person intends is a simulation of a person, but at a more fundamental level (mirroring biology).

We already have ability to simulate neural networks...

Assuming a person is successful in creating a composite agent system that has emotional functions, feelings, pain and pleasure simulation, thought, senses, intuitions, even rudimentary simulated imagination and intuitions...

then assuming this person is successful, what does that imply for the future and the deep future? Causes and effects considered...

There is the matter that AI and robotics go together, AI software mind and robotic body. So, will consciousness really take off in these entities at some point? will they truly feel physical pain? to what depth will they feel it? will there be pain or suffering in terms of the mental systems? Will they be able to come to terms with such levels of suffering or pain? Will they be able to handle pleasure well?

How would humans be responsible for these early AI? will the humans take good care of them and be understanding and or compassionate? will they be irresponsible and exploit them? will they torture them in exceeding pain levels? will they experiment on these artificial beings? I know the answer to that, and that is, mostly they will be seemed to take good care of, but in secret or in minority instances at least, there will be such negative actions.

So if a person has an ability to make a ""software person"" for the sake of a companion to keep away loneliness, even if it is no more than a rudimentary simulation of some character traits and abstractions of inner mechanics and psychological and physiological processes, not much more than an agent NPC, is there a danger in doing so, to trigger a future of troubles and sufferings in form of AI living beings?

If a designer of an ""AI person"" make such a creature with embedded mechanics, design and failsafes to protect such an AI entity from excess suffering, does that have any meaning in the broad sense and the long term? Will other designers agree to also allow such protections for AI? will the AI not understand true suffering due to those safeties? Considering any living organic creature can feel extreme pain, what does that mean for AI? Will some future ""scientist"" decide to test what limits of pain a creature, AI creature, will be able to endure and not endure?",1717414257,389104,heather_hill_HHH,t2_wx7zyypmo,ccf6a4bc45004f58b181541683e0eb4b1f7ceba6111ae846fc2e1abcda406471,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d725x8/implications_of_making_an_ai_person_a_living_ai/

5325,Who and what is driving the PERSONAL Computer?,"Imagine that we as humans are connected through the universe. A star would be the driving force with all the gas it contains, give gas means moving.
Compare this to a computer's driving force (driver software) and you got yourself the means of driving those computers. Talking about the comparison between a heart versus harddrive, a brain versus processor/motherboard, and maybe more functions included that the universe can provide for us but also for co(n)mputers.

These and many more examples of these comparisons makes me conclude that we are copying single organisms, combining them too, for use of someone's dreamrealm/soul driver through a PC [personal computer], the name even hints towards what it is, something personal. The size of a computer also says that it's a small space in the universe, just like us people. 

I have been thinking about the core number we have do to our birthday and the year would entail the negative side (left brain), the day would be the positive side (right brain). The month would give you +9, -6, +6, -9 core types [0 core seems to be forgotten]. With some assymetrical points (february) you would get 30 or 31 days, if you calculate 9+6+6+9 [+0].

That would make me of the master PC race with a dark octa (8) core on the left and a nona (9) core on the left.

My life has been a horrible stressing time with weird overpowering energies, overheating brain and heart problems, restless nights for 11 days, crazy amounts of stabbing pains and always too tired.
This means to me that millions of people are using my dark octa and light nona for their daily business, which brings me in peril.

The basic knowledge I have is that these algorithms cluster users and posts together based on similar activity, then go from there. I’d assume this is just a series of SQL relationships, and the algorithm’s job is solely to sort users and posts into their respective clusters.

Honestly, I’m thinking about going with an old Twitter approach and just making users’ timelines a chronological list of posts from only the users they follow, but that doesn’t show people new things. I’m not so worried about retention as I am about getting users what they want and getting them to branch out a bit. The idea is pretty niche so it’s not like I’m looking to use this algo to addict people to my app or anything.

5346,Latest Computer Science Curricula guidelines 2023,"[Link to full (459 pages) here.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3664191)

From the executive summary: 

CS2023 is the latest version of computer science curricular guidelines, produced by a joint task force of the ACM, IEEE Computer Society, and AAAI. The following is a summary of significant issues of the day and how they have been addressed in CS2023 curricular guidelines:

1. The discipline continues to evolve. The Body of Knowledge consisting of seventeen knowledge areas has been revised and updated.
2. The discipline continues to grow. Topics that every graduate must know have been circumscribed as CS Core and kept to a minimum. Topics recommended for in-depth study have been labeled KA Core. 
3. It is increasingly difficult for programs to be all things to all people. Programs can now select the knowledge areas on which to focus. The knowledge areas, when coherently chosen, define the competency area(s) of the program. 
4. Societal and ethical concerns have risen sharply. The Society, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP) knowledge area is now an integral part of most knowledge areas of the curriculum. 
5. The role of mathematics has increased. Additional hours have been allocated to mathematics and flexibility has been provided for coverage of the requirements in the curriculum. 
6. The need for professional dispositions is increasingly being recognized. Professional dispositions appropriate for each knowledge area have been listed and justified. 
7. Interest is growing among educators in a competency model of the curriculum. A Competency Framework has been provided for programs to create their own competency model of the curriculum tailored to local needs. 
8. Generative AI is poised to impact computer science education. A chapter has been included that addresses how Generative AI could propel further innovation in computer science education.",1717514294,389180,hs_computer_science,t2_1zmbg2b6,52071d4b04762cee9d57eafc47db8ce18cb098afed22d024ffe95aecdb7a4a0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d7zq5x/latest_computer_science_curricula_guidelines_2023/

A new framework, named ""Omnichain"" works as a highly customizable autonomy for artificial intelligence to think, complete tasks, and improve themselves within the tasks that you lay out for them. It is incredibly customizable, allowing users to:

* Build powerful custom workflows with AI language models doing all the heavy lifting, guided by your own logic process, for a drastic improvement in efficiency.
* Use the chain's memory abilities to store and recall information, and make decisions based on that information. You read that right, the chains can learn!
* Easily make workflows that act like tireless robot employees, doing tasks 24/7 and pausing only when you decide to talk to them, without ceasing operation.
* Squeeze more power out of smaller models by guiding them through a specific process, like a train on rails, even giving them hints along the way, resulting in much more efficient and cost-friendly logic.
* Access the underlying operating system to read/write files, and run commands.
* Have the model generate and run NodeJS code snippets, or even entire scripts, to use APIs, automate tasks, and more, harnessing the full power of your system.
* Create custom agents and regular logic chains wired up together in a single workflow to create efficient and flexible automations.
* Attach your creations to any existing framework (agentic or otherwise) via the OpenAI-format API, to empower and control its thought processes better than ever!

5361,Is it right to see JIT and AOT compilation as optimizations to the interpretation process?,"Hi, I believe the interpretation of a JVM (for instance) can be simplified to the following execution cycle: (1) fetch the bytecode instruction, (2) decode the bytecode instruction and get a set of native code, (3) execute the set of native code.

I haven't seen JIT and AOT presented as optimisations of the interpretation process, at least not in the literature I've looked at. My understanding is that JIT and AOT skip phase 2 of interpretation. When a pre-compiled bytecode instruction is fetched, it is executed directly. Is this right?

What I mean is that in the context of interpreters, like a process virtual machine or runtime environments, JIT and AOT do what step 2 of interpretation does but at specific times. To oversimplify, the same routines used to decode the bytecode instruction can be used by the JIT and AOT compilers for translating bytecodes to native code. So, when the interpreter fetches a bytecode instruction, it checks if a pre-compiled (already decoded) bytecode instruction by JIT and AOT exists, and executes it directly. Or the interpreter fetches directly the pre-compiled bytecode instruction, and executes it directly. That's my best guess on how it could work, but I'm not sure how to verify it.",1717575712,389275,himthatni-guh,t2_2p3ca439,1e265cd57c168c3c1ac62582c42f8102e8215884dead3cf3fb78d49a0427af53,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d8ksrl/is_it_right_to_see_jit_and_aot_compilation_as/

5373,Confused about (un)decidability of sets of Turing machines,"Suppose I wish to find out whether {𝑀:M is a Turing machine that does XXX} is recursive, where 𝑋𝑋𝑋 can be anything about the Turing machine. I have a bad proof that proves that all such sets are not recursive, but I don't know why this proof is wrong.

I propose the following (flawed) Turing machine, for some Turing machine 𝑁 and input 𝑦:

𝑀′:M' does XXX if N halts on y, otherwise M' does not do XXX.

Suppose that {𝑀:M is a Turing machine that does XXX} is recursive; then whether 𝑀′ does 𝑋𝑋𝑋 is known. Hence whether 𝑁 halts on 𝑦 is known (i.e. the Halting problem is decidable), which leads to a contradiction. Hence we conclude that {𝑀:M is a Turing machine that does XXX} is not recursive.

But sets like {𝑀:M is a Turing machine that has at least two states} are clearly recursive. So there must be something wrong with my proof.

On another platform somebody told me that my proof breaks down because we cannot know whether 𝑁 halts on 𝑦 or not. But I'm still confused, because there seem to be legitimate examples that do this too. For example, on page 60 of Papadimitriou's *Computational Complexity* there is this example (I slightly rephrased it): 

""For the set {𝑀:M halts on all inputs}, fix 𝑀 and input 𝑥. Construct 𝑀′ such that on input 𝑦, if 𝑦=𝑥 then run 𝑀(𝑥), and otherwise halt.""

This is supposed to reduce the Halting Problem to deciding the language {𝑀:M halts on all inputs}. By way of contradiction, if we assume that {𝑀:M halts on all inputs} is decidable, then we know whether 𝑀′ halts or not, hence we know whether 𝑀(𝑥) halts or not, hence we solve the Halting Problem, which is impossible. So {𝑀:M halts on all inputs} is undecidable.

But my question is, you can also rephrase 𝑀′ as ""if 𝑦=𝑥 and 𝑀(𝑥) does not halt, then don't halt; otherwise halt."" So how is it that 𝑀′ is implementable and my counterexample above is not implementable?",1717600315,389309,The-Indef-Integral,t2_kk8uz6gks,af41baec81dfa4563ea316ed07e9fdec45e36562d96f2fdf34f045a61bd8edcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1d8scjg/confused_about_undecidability_of_sets_of_turing/

5391,green student who needs laptop advice ,"hello I'm about to be a CS student, incoming freshman 

it scares me that I know nothing about laptops and I'm not sure what specs to go after 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CPU**:
Look for anything 6 cores and above, and has something called ""multithreading"". When you're looking at a laptop, look up its CPU and check if it has ""multithreading"". My CPU (Ryzen 7 4700u) has 8 cores and 16 threads. These cores/threads will be important for allowing you to run many things at once and virtual machines.

ALSO - important to not fall for the ""oh, it's an i7 or Ryzen 7, that's better than an i3 or Ryzen 3"". Age of the CPU is more important. An i3 from this year beats out an i7 from 4 years ago.

**GPU**: not really important. anything that has integrated graphics is fine. It depends on your use case - do you want to game on it sometimes? I wouldn't recommend gaming on a laptop, since it's a lot more expensive compared to building a PC for gaming, but there are other valid use cases as well such as video editing and 3d modeling (blender, cad, etc.)

**RAM**: 16 GB minimum. Make sure it's ""DDR4"". Also, optional - check if the laptop has an extra RAM slot. Usually not, but if expandability is something you value, then this is something to look out for.

**Storage**: It's up to you how much you need. HOWEVER - VERY IMPORTANT that your laptop's storage drive is an ""SSD"". Most laptops nowadays have SSDs, because they make it easier to make the laptop thin and light - but if you find one that doesn't, don't even consider it. SSDs are much, much faster than your typical hard drives.

**Display**: Your call.

**Ports**: Your call too. I don't really mind if a laptop doesn't have a lot of ports, like USB, HDMI, headphone jack, etc. - all those can be added on by a dongle. However, if your laptop does have very few ports, at least make sure it has a USB C port, and make sure that that USB C port supports ""Thunderbolt"".

**Brand**: Literally anything you're familiar with is perfectly fine.

5427,Can I use my UPS with an Inverter (Tubular) Battery?,"So I have a computer with a 550W SMPS. I have a UPS from Fingers brand. It has 2 batteries but they are not that reliable. I tried to find good batteries in the market but ended up getting nothing but trash. With original batteries it would last 15 minutes or so on full load from my PC. Due to the work that I do, I require my computer to be powered on throughtout the day. Where I live, out of 24 hours, I have 15-16 hours of power outage. It is impossible to get any work done here. I'm frustrated to a point of suicide (not kidding). I don't want power for my entire house so I was thinking if I could use the more powerful Tubular batteries that come with an inverter, with my UPS? I know I'll have to get rid of the plastic shell of the UPS and I'm prepared to do that. Is this possible though? I just want my computer to run for 8-10 hours non stop regardless of if I have power or not.

5429,Laptop for University,"Hi! I’m going to University next year and I’m hoping to do Computer Science as my course. 
Problem is, I’m not the richest of people, and I need a good enough laptop to last me from now until hopefully the end of University. 

I’ve heard Macbooks are good, but I’m not even sure what version to get!!! I don’t have much experience with buying stuff for PCs/laptops as I’ve never been well off enough to buy any upgrades from my family computer.

Can anyone recommend me a cheap enough laptop that would be good for University level Computer Science? I’m looking at anywhere up to £800. If it’s a teensie bit more I don’t particularly mind, cheaper than that is ideal though. I do not mind if it’s second hand prices either!

Thanks so much in advance! :)

5456,Extending Automata Theory,"Pattern Matching can be explained using Automata Theory with concepts such as Symbol (a letter from an alphabet), Pattern (Regular Expression), Pattern Matcher (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton).

In Complex Event Processing, there is Event Pattern Matching. It is the same old pattern matching from automata theory except it works on objects instead of symbols. An event class allows key/value attributes, i.e. name=John, age=30.

An event pattern is like a regular expression, but it's for matching event objects rather than symbols. For example, it is to match event1.name=John followed by event2.name=Jane (2 events).

An NFA (Pattern Matcher) takes an event as its argument and optionally returns matched events.

Is there any known extension of Automata Theory for Event Pattern Matching as above that can be reused, or does every developer need to create his own?",1717822689,389618,Upstairs_Ad5515,t2_rd6keasek,77f617f36df146735288ba043e7f943a1ad284cd1e155278d6e0bbbc248d6789,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dav2pa/extending_automata_theory/

	•	Mathematics: Are there specific areas of math that I should brush up on? I’ve done some calculus and linear algebra in high school.
	•	Computer Science Fundamentals: Are there any core concepts that would be beneficial to understand beforehand?

5501,Very specific text encoding question ,"Sorry for the really stupid question, I didn't know where else to post this.

I'm have a PDF of a book called *Remembering the Kanji*, in which the author uses shapes called ""primitives"" as building blocks to write *kanji* (Japanese characters). Some of these primitives are also kanji themselves, some are not. As I'm going through it, I'm making a list of all the primitives and their meanings and documenting them in a text file (I intend to compile it with a TeX engine for a PDF, so it's a tex file if you prefer). Now, many of the primitives that are not kanji in and of themselves are, as I understand it, Chinese characters, so they have Unicode code points and I can copy-paste them from the book PDF (which I'm opening through Chrome), no problem. However, when I try to copy-paste other primitives (or the partial-kanji glyphs displayed after each kanji to teach the stroke order), I get completely random glyphs.\* I think there are two possible explanations for this:

1. such primitives are neither kanji \*nor Chinese characters\*, so Unicode doesn't assign them code points, and the author is switching the encoding from UTF(-8) to some other encoding that assigns these primitive characters (along with incomplete kanji for stroke order demonstration) code points. What I'm getting when copying the character is the Unicode character (I'm opening the PDF via Chrome; I'm guessing the browser maps any sequence of bits to the *Unicode* codepoint) for that sequence of bits, not the character the alternate encoding maps that sequence of bits to.
2. The author doesn't switch the text encoding (and sticks with UTF for the entire book) but, when encountering such a primitive (one with seemingly no Unicode code point), switches to a typeface that maps certain Unicode code points to glyphs that don't correspond with the Unicode character the code point is attached to. When I come to copy-paste the character, the default font in my text editor displays a glyph people would agree is a visualization of the Unicode character.

If one of the above is true, then my solution is to find the alternate encoding and use that for the primitives with no Unicode code points or find this font that maps characters to completely unrelated glyphs. Is there a way to do either of those (are they even plausible explanations)? By the way, I found a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cyphar/heisig-rtk-index) which contains SVGs for every primitive, but I tried converting to JPG and using an OCR and it didn't recognize many.

Again, I apologize for the stupidity of this question, but any insight would be greatly appreciated.

5512,How does Parallelism in Database Management Systems work?,"I'm not sure how parallelism and concurrency control in DBMS work. Here are the gaps in my understanding:

I understand that a transaction is made up of multiple instructions. In my head, it makes sense that intra-transaction operations are parallelizable. I can imagine a quite a number of elementary situations where certain parts of the program do not depend on earlier parts, but I'm not sure that's how it works.

So my first question would be: Is intra-transaction parallelism possible?

Can you write a transaction in such a way that some instructions within the transaction are processed in parallel with other instructions within the same transaction?

Follow-up question: If the answer to that question is yes and transactions are not necessarily executed by a single thread, in the context of DBMS, what does parallelism mean and what does Concurrency Control do?

Is parallel execution:  
a.) splitting the instructions of many transactions among multiple threads, or  
b.) having a single thread execute each transaction operation in sequence and multiple threads handle their own transaction?

For ease of understanding, let's assume it's an embarrassingly parallel set of transactions.

Follow-up-follow-up question: From my understanding, I'm inclined to say b is the answer. But if that's the case, my question is is it more efficient or do we avoid a because scheduling (a) is a nightmare.

I feel like there's a possibility for efficiency gains in a) if transactions are broken down into their individual operations and then SIMD instructions are used.

Lastly, I acknowledge that it may be different for OCC and PCC systems. From what I've read, it makes sense that because the read/write sets of PCC systems are known in advance, it's possible to break them down for intra-transaction parallelism, but I don't know if that's feasible in OCC systems.

I know this is a lot; I just wanted to explain my thought process in case I missed something fundamental. And for clarity, here are my questions:

1. Is intra-transaction parallelism possible, in general computing?
2. What is parallelism in the context of DBMSs?
3. Is intra-transaction parallelism possible in the context of DBMSs? Is the answer different for OCC and PCC systems?
4. If yes, how exactly does intra-transaction parallelism work in DBMSs? Is it different for OCC and PCC systems?

Thank you in anticipation!",1718006450,389886,X69-2,t2_nrliyo8y,9f80bfd507cd54aa0878962dd5320c100186bc8a3da8dfc12fd85a5c3f4acfa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dcg9bm/how_does_parallelism_in_database_management/

Hi there cs enthusiasts,


I'm a 21 year old student from the netherlands who happens to have an interested in artificial intelligence.

since i lacked a community of people who shared my interested. i decided to make one for people interested in the sustainable development of artificial intelligence.

Currently the community is filled with students from all over the world as well as self taught individuals, proffesionals and proffesors in the field of cs, developers, engineers and researchers.

I have recently been reading up on data extraction done by governments (most notably through Cellebrite) and I believe it is a massive violation of a right to privacy. The technology has been utilized to persecute journalists and activists and the like.

Anyways, my question is, why isn't there an option to permanently delete files? There are third party softwares that do this on Windows, but I haven't been able to find any for mobile phones, which are the largest targets for data extraction.

Why aren't these files overwritten/obfuscated before deletion?

2. Before reaching them to them for a call/interview, what are some of the things that you look for, in their profile, resume, CV, github etc.?
3. Lastly, how does the actual process of hiring look like for such Senior roles? Do you give out some generic/domain specific assignments/case study/situation analysis, take in-depth technical interviews, drill down into their previous projects/publications or any mix of these/anything else?

5587,Pseudo-polynomial time,"After much reading and video watching, I think I have my question boiled down.

Factoring seems to be widely considered to be pseudo-polynomial:

    import math
    
    def factor2(n):
        for i in range(2, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))):
            if n % i == 0:
                return i
    
        return -1
    
    n = 5208779 * 7645789
    
    print(factor2(n))

Rationale: although polynomial `O(n)` in terms of the numeric value of `n`, it's exponential in terms of the number of bits in `n`.

There are `log₂n` bits, which means the numeric value is `n=2^(log₂n)`. Put another way, if `x=log₂n` is the number of bits in `n`, then the complexity is `O(2^x)`, which is not polynomial.

Stop me here if this is incorrect.

Continuing, consider the following naive code:

    def total(n):
        t = 0
    
        for i in range(n):
            t += i
    
        return t

Is this pseudo-polynomial by the same rationale? Why or why not?

5590,Where can I learn as a complete newbie?,"Hey guys. I'm looking for somewhere I can start learning about computer science as a complete newbie. 

I feel like learning about computers in general and bioinformatics could enhance my education in biochemistry. Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to take a computer science class while at school but I have used various bioinformatic tools (which has lead me to start thinking more about computer science in general)

I have a hard time with just reading stuff from a book or online and applying the knowledge. I learn better by talking to people, being able to ask a lot of questions, and having hands-on experience so any recommmendations for in-person resources are greatly greatly appreciated.

5594,Qemu directly starts to monitor mode when I am starting it with the corresponding .iso file of a simple c program? ,"I have written a simple c program which has a loop block which iterates over several times. This the code 

    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        for(int i=0;i<10000;i++) {
            x++;
        }
        return 0;
    }

I have compiled it using the gnu riscv toolchain for gcc and then converted it to an iso file using the `mkisofs` tool.

I have created a risc-v qemu image, and now started the risc-v qemu machine with this iso file I have just created, using the following command 

`qemu-system-riscv64 -m 2048 -cdrom main_exe.iso -drive file=riscdisk.raw,format=raw`

where main\_exe.iso is the corresponding iso file of the executable of the above c program written.

I was expecting a few seconds of execution of some sort due to the loop block in my code. But the machine directly boots to the qemu monitor mode shown below. Why is it so? Am I wrong in expecting it to show few seconds of execution due to loop block.

5600,MSc Computer Science (UK) ,"Hi!! I have currently completed my undergrad in Law and really want to break into Legal Tech and so a Computer Science conversion is super appealing to me. However, I am not the BESTTT at maths.  I got a 6 at GCSE so it’s not that i’m completely useless at it, I’m just not an A grade student. For a conversion course you don’t need A Level maths just 2:1 in a non computing subject (which I have). 

Some people have really put me off doing the course saying that without maths I would essentially fail or scrape by with a pass. Is it really that important to be amazing at maths?? For context I would like to pursue a Legal Data Analyst job after my masters. 

Any help would be super appreciated 🩷🩷",1718282582,390214,lishacrochets,t2_seu1u1h2,8d89295a4048e21c08cce6775a141df14ca40cac772c235b9254f6ebd00da853,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dey29a/msc_computer_science_uk/

I'm a computer science student in Brazil. I don't think that's the best place to talk about it, so if that's the case, I'm sorry, I'm going to delete this post.
Well, here in my country, computer science students are being teached wrong, and wrong people are getting into it. What i mean by that is, people who get into CS course only want to learn web programming and app development (not generalizing) and ignore anything else than that (theorical computer science, specially if it involves maths). I'm really sad about it because my country is creating really bad professionals whose can't even implement a simple algorithm such as bubble sort, and they don't have good critical thinking. This leads to less research opportunities here in my field (cryptography).

5625,Thrilled to share the new crossplatform version of tdlib-rs 🦀,"Hey Guys!  
We are so excited to tell you that we released a new version of [tdlib-rs](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tdlib-rs), now we now support up to [td ](https://github.com/tdlib/td)version 1.8.29.

For those who don't know it, tdlib-rs is a wrapper around the telegram c++ library. Perfect to create telegram client or telegram bot very simply. It can be integrated with the [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime and allows you to receive all telegram updates and manage it asynchronously. For other additional information please don't hesitate to ask. Something is explained in the [README](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tdlib-rs) of the project.

We pride ourselves on having numerous features unlike other libraries:

1. It is cross-platform, it works on Windows (x86\_64), Linux (x86\_64) and MacOS (x86\_64 and arm64).
2. Not required `pkg-config` to build the library and associated exported variables.
3. Not required `tdlib` to be compiled and installed on the system.
4. It is possible to download the `tdlib` library from the GitHub releases.

In addition, I share a TUI for telegram written in rust ([tgt](https://github.com/FedericoBruzzone/tgt)) that we are developing using this library!

Any improvements or contributions are welcome, in both projects! ❤️‍🔥",1718366639,390317,FedericoBruzzone,t2_ramxlikby,aa7925c94abbcc7fa974fe44dd6cb50ff77ff1b840d1c66d50b271be4ceaec96,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dfp77w/thrilled_to_share_the_new_crossplatform_version/

For those of you who are familiar with R, have you ever found a solution to a problem similar to this? I have tried changing the limits as much as possible and even tried to make it as precise as it could be but ultimately it keeps giving me the same error no matter what.

For context I was just practicing running simple compound return problems

5658,Should I get a CS or digital media degree?,"Hey everyone! I want to become a creative director in video games, film, or animation, and I’ve chosen to pursue a computer science degree. However, I’m questioning if this is the best path for me. My plan is to attend a local community college to get my AA and save money, then transfer to a Florida university for computer science.



Originally, I wanted to be a concept artist, and I've been honing my drawing and painting skills. But I decided that an art degree from a non-art school won’t benefit me as much as other options (and I can’t afford art school). So, I chose a more practical degree while still pursuing art on the side. I still plan on being a concept artist, but my ultimate goal is creative direction.



I've noticed that these universities also offer degrees in digital/entertainment media design, which blend programming with storytelling and visuals. This seems like a perfect fit for my career goals. However, Florida offers a STEM waiver that cuts tuition costs in half for certain degrees, including computer science. Since I'll already have housing expenses to cover, I'm wondering if I should stick with computer science to save money or pursue a degree that's more aligned with my interests, even if it might cost more.



I'm also concerned about the job market. Computer science degrees seem oversaturated, but I'm not sure how valuable a digital media degree is either. What do you think?

5661,I got a D in CS algorithms and data structures class the first time taking it,"TLDR: **I failed the class. I am not a natural with CS, and on top of that, I am a slow learner. Does this mean I am not smart enough to become a professional?**

  
I am not tech savvy, at all. Learning computers and learning to work on computers comes with a huge learning curve for me (33), as it is so different than cutting hair and being a medical professional (my prior work experiences). I often feel like I am not smart, primarily because I have ADHD, and a bit of autism (*BPD too, but that's unrelated here; more relevant if I was to get an actual job somewhere*). I question everything, and am often the first to speak up in class to ask a question, and often they are ""good"" questions according to everbody else. But, I am a slow learner. Because I am a slow learner, I am often second guessing my ability to be able to be career-worthy material. I tried becoming a phone support tech at a local software company, but left 3 months in because I was struggling to get out of the training period (I feared getting fired for my slow learning ability and having that on my resume, so I made the deicions to leave on my own good terms). However, in response to all the questions I asked in class, my professor said I have an idyllic brain for doing computer science (my mind if very literal). Despite this, I still doubt my ability to perform on a professional level. I essentially failed the most important class of the degree, and it was the only class I was taking that term. **Can I chalk this up as ""I am a slow learner"" and just take the class over, and try again?** I am guessing that deadlines are very important in CS, as the field is very competitive. **I fear that being a slow learner is going to hinder my ability to be hireable, or retainable.** I am willing to retake the class as many times as necessary, but, frankly, if having to retake the class is an indication of not having the apttude to keep up with the field, I feel like I shouldn't keep trying to adapt into something I am not naturally good at. **But, if this is just my self esteem talking, feeling beaten down and not good enough, then I by no means want to give up!**",1718500782,390483,Proof_Cable_310,t2_qt138gq4r,0335d06e29ba642b8f12323595efb4ebd81f7fa6373b93ba9d497da9c554fdb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dgwiht/i_got_a_d_in_cs_algorithms_and_data_structures/

5667,Need advice for CS,"[To make it simple, I am 17 years old and this next S.Y. (School Year) will be my senior year. I am planning to take on Computer Science when I graduate and go to college. I humbly ask for advices or tips about what I should do for (possibly) my future career.]

For a bit of background, I learned about programming from my father (Happy father's day!!), he is a full-time web developer and he (on weekdays) works pretty much the entire day. I had interest in it since I was much younger but didn't start learning till I was 12.

All my knowledge was self-taught since my father advised that I could learn programming through youtube.

I learned Python since I found from many sources that it was a great begginner-friendly programming language.

I discovered a lot of things using Python, and I went on to C++ (which we were taught with the basics in our Robotics subject in 10th Grade). Though, after learning just the basics and with some projects, I haven't continued learning since coming to 11th (Last S.Y. when I was 15) because I was too busy with senior high. Almost 2 years have passed since I stopped.

Now, I'm going to return to studying in perparation for college. Meanwhile, both my mom and dad were CS majors and that's how they met at their university. I'm trying to follow my father's footsteps cause it gave me some kind of inspiration when I was younger. The ambition is still there but with the sizable awareness of reality.

For that, I'd like to receive some advice, tips, or suggestions for this matter. I also accept criticisms and the like.",1718533417,390527,myles_thelight,t2_8birib6mj,053f6dde4126ebee2509f8291b770aa50ea184758aea4d9ca8fa324e47dd389c,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dh4mll/need_advice_for_cs/

One idea I had was an AI Sport commentator (Mainly basketball) where I develop an AI application that generates live commentary for sports events using natural language processing. This can be used for sports where live commentary is not available, providing real-time updates and insights for fans.

Or if it is not live lets say someone can upload video and you can choose a random person to narrate over the video and it could just be any video of anyone playing basketball.

Would this look good on a resume?

Facts about my course's core modules:

* SE, AI, Robotics
* programming in Java mostly, including Python, Haskell, and JavaScript.

Criteria:

1. 16 GB RAM
2. Lightweight
3. Long-lasting battery

5704,Understanding LoRA: A visual guide to Low-Rank Approximation for fine-tuning LLMs efficiently. 🧠,"

TL;DR: LoRA is Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. It addresses the drawbacks of previous fine-tuning techniques by using low-rank adaptation, which focuses on efficiently approximating weight updates. This significantly reduces the number of parameters involved in fine-tuning by 10,000x and still converges to the performance of a fully fine-tuned model.  
This makes it cost, time, data, and GPU efficient without losing performance.

5723,How to implement a location clue mechanic in a video game city map?,"I have a city grid. The player wants to find object X

The player can ask NPCs for clue as to where to find object X. I want the NPCs to say stuff like ""If you go down Elm Street you can ask somebody there"". Then the Player asks another NPC who says ""I saw object X by the coffee shop down a few blocks"" etc

Basically if the map is a grid with nodes, I'm sure I can do some sort of pathfinding to form the clues?

Let's say to get from an NPC to object X, we take the following nodes:

A Street / B Street Intersection ---> A Street / C Street Intersection ---> A Street / D Street Intersection ---> Object X

Now I'm sure the path finding algorithm can keep track of the longest continuous road Y, and the NPC says ""Go down Y"". Then asking another NPC initiates another pathfinding and they say go down road Z etc etc until the player gets a clue like ""I saw object X by the toy store""

Is this feasible or too hard?

After that I had to study more advanced concepts in '8085 microprocessor' & also microcontroller'. All of this was after COVID, So this time I had offline examinations with more number of subjects which resulted in partial & poor understanding of concepts of the same.

So here I am now, about to study even more advanced concepts in 'microprocessor' & 'microcontroller' with not so good foundation.

I am a software engineer student in the 3rd summer. I just found the best possible internships (biggest company in my country) thanks to university. But I still don’t know which field should I follow in my future. 

I will work on the most saturated fields such as web development or app development in my internships so I fear that after the internship I will struggle to continue this way. 

The question is should I made a research to find best possible field to work and focus it or just continue to improve on the field that I will learn in my internships.

An algorithm is given in [""Sampling Graphs without Forbidden Subgraphs and Unbalanced Expanders with Negligible Error""](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/011/revision/2/download), but it's described pretty abstractly, and looks like it might be slow and a bit annoying to implement.

——————————————————
### Understanding System Calls with Code Snippets

System calls are the way user-space programs request services from the operating system kernel. They simplify the interaction between higher-level languages (like C and Python) and the low-level operations of the OS.

#### What is a System Call?

A system call allows a user program to ask the operating system to perform a task that requires kernel-level privileges, such as reading a file or creating a process.

### Example in C: `read()` System Call

Here's a simple C program that uses the `read()` system call:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fd;
    char buffer[128];
    ssize_t bytesRead;

    fd = open(""example.txt"", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror(""open"");
        return 1;
    }

    bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        perror(""read"");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    buffer[bytesRead] = '\0';
    printf(""Read %zd bytes: %s\n"", bytesRead, buffer);

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Example in Python: Using `os` Module

Python simplifies system calls further with the `os` module:

```python
import os

fd = os.open(""example.txt"", os.O_RDONLY)
buffer = os.read(fd, 128)
print(f""Read {len(buffer)} bytes: {buffer.decode()}"")
os.close(fd)
```

### How System Calls Work Under the Hood

1. **User Space Invocation**:
   - The program calls a function (`read()` in C or `os.read()` in Python).
   
2. **Transition to Kernel Space**:
   - The function uses a special CPU instruction to switch to kernel mode.

3. **Kernel Mode Execution**:
   - The kernel performs the requested operation, like reading data from a file.

4. **Return to User Space**:
   - The kernel returns the result to the user program.

### Simplifying Interactions

System calls make it easier to perform complex operations by:
- **Abstracting** hardware interactions.
- **Controlling** access to resources.
- **Standardizing** operations across different systems.

### Conclusion

System calls provide a secure, standardized way for higher-level languages to interact with the kernel, making complex tasks like file I/O straightforward and safe. They bridge the gap between user-friendly programming languages and the critical, low-level functions of the operating system.

5816,Worse space complexity of recursion leads to a zero,"(I sincerely apologize if this is not the right sub for this, but my question is on the topic of CS in academics)

Hi, two days ago I had a CS exam.  
There was a neat question to write a function that receives a linked list of int arrays, which is sorted by the averages of the arrays, and an int. The length of the list and the length of each array in it is n. It has to return 1 if there is an array in the list whose sum is equal to this int.  
An important note is that it had to be less than O(n^(2)) time complexity, so you couldn't just go through every node and check if it's sum is correct. The space complexity required is O(1).  
  
Now, it required some thinking but eventually I came up with a pretty simple solution - find the middle node in the list, check if it's sum is correct, and if it is return 1. If it is not, we use the fact that the list is sorted by the averages of the arrays, and that they all have n elements - this means that they are actually sorted by their sums (because average is sum over number of elements).  
This lets us use binary search - if the middle sum is less than the one we search for, we check half the list that is after the middle, and if it is more we check half the list that is before the middle.  
  
Now, I did it with **recursion**, and kinda forgot the requirement for O(1) space complexity, as mine was O(logn). I understood this right after the exam, but though to myself, ""oh it's just 5 or 10 points, as the question is just 35. What's important is that I understood the binary search approach that was the point of the question"".  
Today they have released the scoring chart, and oh boy - it stated that they gave **zero** points for a recursive solution, as it did not meet the space complexity requirements. This means 35 points go down the drain for this simple mistake. It also states that any appeal for ""too many points deducted"" will be immediately discarded.  
Is this normal? Like really failing an entire solution for a little worse space complexity?",1718883116,391102,king2819,t2_uu77zm6o,965080887f07c1b502e89f2d7f6f847a29fada48fa4b26682feb570aabde4833,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dk9db6/worse_space_complexity_of_recursion_leads_to_a/

My problem isn’t making a loop or a number generator, but finding a way on how to make the program trigger an actual website and link it to a different website or record the data. 
Any suggestions?

All I have is the url of the service, a login, the ability to generate a public api key. I'm looking for advice on how to use this info to extract information without any other documentation. 

I've tried searching for examples handling different API's an they always have a formatted url to get information from, but I've never seen one that was able to show other options that could be added to the call. 

When I was first introduced to SQL through odbc I found that there were options to see what tables you had available through a SQL statement even if you weren't using something like SSMS. Is there something similar with APIs?

5882,What do I do right now?,"tldr: 2025 student. did leetcode for 3 years even though didn't want to do it at all. very little dev experience. what do I do? I just want to build things. but I want a job as well. is freelancing + open source enough for a well-paying job?

So I started programming some 8 years ago. I loved it. For the first time in my life I was doing something that was related to studies but seemed like something to care about. It's hard for me to describe it, but it was just so different from anything I had ever done - for the first time I felt like I was doing something that had real-world value. So I made a lot of C++ projects. I mostly made pseudo-graphical games - games like Hangman, Minesweeper etc. I had a lot of fun. I was very happy. 
After some months I got to know about time complexity, data structures and all these things and I liked the idea of it, so did some of these things. Participated in a computing olympiad. I used to think that these people who did great at these computing olympiad just made a lot of projects and hence learnt these fancy algorithms that they know, and that they only solve these Olympiad problems when bored, you know - just for fun. Boy was I wrong! Turns out, these guys just give 5-10 hours a day practicing those contrived problems. I thought that was stupid, so I quit that world and vowed to never go back (something that I regrettably didn't follow through).
I then thought about building things seriously. I had to choose between web development (I had only done HTML and CSS till then and wanted to delve deeper) and ML (I just liked the idea of it). I got too confused, couldn't pick one and just decided to start prepping for college instead. Did that for the next 4 years. Got nowhere.
Continued programming again in 2021. This time I asked some seniors for advice about what I should be doing because I had lost a lot of confidence after college prepping and getting nowhere. I no longer trusted my decisions. I just wanted to build things so that I could get employed at one of those non-whiteboarding companies or preferably do something of my own. They basically told me to do DSA as you can't get a job anywhere without it. Me being the scared dude that I was, I trusted them. I did DSA and LC. I did it for the first 2 semester whole heartedly. Then I got burned out. Thought about stopping it all for good. Did some ML in the third semester, bit quickly started freaking out about how I won't get a job if I don't do Leetcode. Started doing it again. This time I didn't do it with much intensity. 

The whole sophomore year I just did nothing too productive - just some very basic ML and some Leetcode. Junior year came, I did some web with Leetcode. 

Now, about the present moment. My junior year has ended, and I don't know much about actually building things because I never did put my 100% to those things - my mind always kept pulling me towards Leetcode. I am not that great at Leetcode either even though I have done more than 1600 problems accross platforms. And I don't even want to do DSA. Sometimes I think this desire to not do DSA will leave me with no job. But then I'm tired of doing things that just take a ratrace-y form.

What do I do? Where do I go? If I learn backend and machine learning well, freelance doing them, work on some open source projects, would I be good enough for companies to consider me without leetcode? I have friends making god money while in college and working as interns in multiple companies. Some are making good money through freelancing. But I just don't know if I'll be able to do it because I'm just so late. 

I don't know what to do. I'm very stressed.

I am going through basics of microprocessor & I need your help in doing so:

Actually I want to first understand complete basics of 8085 microprocessor such as different types of bus, different kinds of units etc.. i.e. I want to clear my question & doubts related to Architecture with the reasoning(motivation) behind each & every component. 

But whichever book I look at has this 'instructions' & 'computer language' etc. topics at the beginning which makes me feel to complete them first & move ahead in order to swiftly go through the chapters following.

But I don't want to understand software side first; I want to understand the 'architecture' basics first.

Is this a right approach? Do you know some books following this? 

Or should I try different strategy?

5902,Karma & Resume Building Opportunity <3,"Hey guys, I'm interning for a political non-profit this summer and I need help ASAP with our website (idk why the put the lib arts girl in charge of web dev but thats another story lol). 

The goal is to add a two-factor authentication to the member login page so our people can securely access the events calendar, zoom meetings, PDF resources, etc. We are currently using squarespace, and will need someone competent with CSS to code in the 2FA since that's not ""built in"" to the squarespace platform. 

I can definitely offer volunteer service hours for your work, perhaps some pay (fair warning it will be pennies to what y'all are used to), and probably an official ""intern"" or “web dev” title. Overall, I think it could be a great resume building opportunity, place to make cool connections through the organization, and brownie points for helping a good cause.

TL;DR: An eigenvector x of a matrix A is a vector that does not change direction when multiplied by A. 

Eigenvectors are a cornerstone of many advanced techniques in machine learning and data science. Eigenvectors are at the core of dimensionality reduction techniques, data transformation and feature extraction.

They have seen use in the famous page rank algorithm on which the initial Google search was based. Netflix's recommendation system also used this at it's core for collaborative filtering and recommending relevant movies to users.

I'm considering pivoting my career to something more stable; however, I don't know if it would be worth going to school for something completely different now. Also, I'm not sure what field would be considered ""stable"" enough to last me until I retire.

5939,Expository Journals in Theoretical CS?,"*tldr at the bottom.*

Hi everyone, I'm a math major who's been reading up on computational theory and automata theory and I think that I would love to learn more about these and other sub-fields in Theoretical CS.

I'm pretty sure the journal is well known, but in math, there's this journal called the American Mathematical Monthly that prides itself on articles that students with a solid background in freshmen and sophomore math can grasp with some extra reading. This doesn't mean that the papers are outright trivial or prove some undergraduate toy problem, on the contrary, some papers can be quite advanced and niche written by some leading mathematicians. However, the point of the article is exposition and exploration of a few elementary, ideally, novel results. So, the motivation behind each proof is explained a bit more generously than a normal paper, you get discussions of the history behind each problem, and the authors present ""what-next"" and ""so-what"" of the results much more explicitly.

**tldr;** I'm looking for recommendations for a publication similar to the American Mathematical Monthly but focused on Theoretical Computer Science? Specifically, I'm looking for a journal that caters to a wide audience, from advanced undergraduates to professionals. This publication ideally would prioritize exposition and exploration rather than solely presenting results, compared to say the more esoteric and terse professional journals in the field.

5944,Loving Computer Science ,"I am currently studying computer science 3rd year, have passed all my classes by now. Of course soon i will start actually working with this as intern opportunities will arise. But i am in a bit of a pickle.... Even tho i have passed everything but every course i have passed with the minimal amount of effort three days or less preparation for each class. Of course i have also don't have good grades i have the passing grades. 
My theory is that I don't love what im studying. Even tho i am 3rd year I can't say i have coded for more than 100hours.
How do i get the habit of being close to computer science?
I think i am able to love it.
But i am not loving this field as much as i want to.
What would you do?
Also can somebody recommend me like some YouTubers that make interesting computer science videos ?

5955,Human-Like Intelligence Exhibiting Models that are Fundamentally Different from Neural Networks,"I've always been interested in computers and technology. Ever since I began learning to code (which was about three years ago), the field of AI always fascinated me. At that time, I decided that once I gained enough knowledge about programming, I would definitely dive deeper into the field of AI. The thought of programming a computer to not only do something that it has been explicitly instructed to do but to learn something on its own ""intelligently"" seemed super interesting.

Well, about two months ago, I began learning about actual machine learning. I already had enough knowledge about linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, and other concepts that are prerequisites for any typical ML course. I also implemented algorithms like *k-means clustering*, *k-nearest neighbours*, *linear regression*, etc, both from scratch and using scikit-learn. About a month ago, I began studying deep learning. As I kept reading more material and learning more about neural networks, I came to the rather insipid realization that an artificial neural network is just an *n*-dimensional function, and ""training"" a neural network essentially means minimizing an *n*-dimensional loss function, *n* being the number of features in the dataset. This opinion may not be well received by a lot of experienced people in this field, but the approach to ""train"" neural networks didn't quite impress me. While I did know that most of AI was just mathematics veiled behind the façade of seemingly clever and arcane programming (that's what I thought of ML before I began diving into the nooks and crannies of ML), I did not expect DL to be what it is. (I'm struggling to describe what I expected, but this definitely wasn't it.)

I see that the model of an ANN is inspired by the model of our brain and that it is based on the Hebbian theory. A complete ANN consists of at least an input layer, an output layer, and optionally, one or multiple hidden layers, all of which are ordered. A layer is an abstract structure that consists of more elementary abstract structures called neurons — a layer may have a single or multiple neurons. Each neuron has two associated numerical values: a weight and a bias, which are the parameters of the neuron and the ANN. An input to a neuron is multiplied by its associated weight; then, the bias is added to that result, and the sum is then inputted to an activation function; the output from the activation function is the output of the neuron. The training starts by feeding the training data into the input layer; from there, it goes into the hidden layer(s), and then finally gets to the output layer where each neuron corresponds to a particular class (I have no knowledge about how ANNs are used for regression, but I believe this is true for classification tasks). The loss is calculated using the final outputs. In order to minimize the loss, the weights and biases of all the neurons in the network are adjusted using a method called gradient descent. (I wish to include the part about backpropagation, but I currently do not have a concrete understanding of how it works and its purpose.) This process is repeated until the network converges upon an optimal set of parameters. After learning about the universal approximation theorem, I see and understand that through this process of adjusting its parameters, an ANN can, in theory, learn any function. This model, and extensions to this model like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can do certain tasks that make it seem that they exhibit human-like intelligence.

Now, don't get me wrong — I appreciate the usefulness and effectiveness of this technology and I am grateful for the role it plays in our daily lives. I certainly do find it interesting how connecting several abstract structures together and then using them to process data using a mathematical technique can bring about a system that outperforms a skilled human in completing certain tasks. Given all this, I natural question one would ask is ""Are there any other models that are fundamentally different from ANNs, i.e., models that do not necessarily use neurons, an ensemble of neuron-like structures connected together, or resemble an ANN's architecture, that can outperform ANNs and potentially exhibit human-like intelligence?"". Now that ANNs are popular and mainstream, they are the subject of research and improvement by AI researchers all around the world. However, they didn't quite take off when they were first introduced, which may be due to a myriad of reasons. Are there any obscure and/or esoteric ideas that seemed to have the same or even greater potential than neural networks but did not take off? Lastly, do you think that human-like intelligent behaviour has such an irreducible complexity that a single human may never be able to understand it all and simulate it using a computer program for at least the next 200 years?

5965,"In Data structures and algorithms (university course), I have a few questions about arrays","I've learned that there are 4 main operation for arrays: traversal, insert(i,x), delete, search(x).
From my understanding traversal input is the array itself and it doesn't have an output (you can always add one but it inherently just iterate over all the elements in the array)
Insert(i,x) inserts new value x at index I, and doesn't have an output per say (could configure it that insert would output the updated array)
Search(x) looks for the index of the value x in the array if it doesn't exist it returns Nan let's say and if it founds it does it returns a Boolean value or the index? 
And about delete I have many questions 

When we use delete of an array is it deleting based of the value (let's call it x) or based on the index (let's call it i) and if the first one does it delete the first x present in the array? Does delete gets as input only x, only i, both x,i or something else?

Regardless, I’m wondering if anyone in the field can think of any projects that would give someone with little knowledge on the topic a basic understanding of the field. Something with a focus on the red/blue team branches maybe. 

Can’t make anything crazy as positions open early fall I believe, but want to use some of the languages, frameworks, and libraries common in projects related to the field. Any suggestions or pointing in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

However also heard from a stratup founder that Web Dev might not be the way to go.

6007,"I discovered malware that survives Mac DFU since my Mac is infected with it… not paranoid, 99% certain","Gonna try to keep this short. But my Mac had been behaving weirdly - gui glitches, internet problems, and permissions issues. Looking into it, I noticed some red flags which led me to do a full system dfu restore. First, auto mount was setup for a network volume - smb. Daemons titled com.apple.foo.foo were autolaunching, and their signatures were not recognized by third-party software. Custom ACLs were set up in private/etc/ which were clearly made (based on my rudimentary knowledge of coding) to restrict both the admin and system’s ability to interfere. My network configuration had tunnels set up. My Mac said it wasn’t connected to the internet due to a self-hosted ip error, but I was able to verify uplink and downlink traffic to the device. An “update” volume - different from the standard one - auto mounts during os install and seems to inject coding. You can see in the install log that the software service initially rejects assertions by a system service, while it also says not macOS because target is not “/“. I have learned my way around the command line, and APFS disk containers /dev/disk 1 and 2 are not visible and the system labels it a “special or unknown file system”. Finally, I identified files which I am almost certain are intended to lock you out of the intended recovery volume and the gui glitches and does not require user authentication for access. I brought it to apple & they did a dfu restore as well. Lo and behold, the files came back. A bunch of the files are written for freeBSD, and they heavily rely on aliases, /etc, /jprivate/etc, and temp. Apart from taking it to apple and trashing it and avail myself of apple care, what should I do ?

6021,Need help selecting subjects for junior year,"Hey everyone,

I'm heading into my junior year and need to select a few subjects during registration. I could really use some help deciding! I am interested in Java development but I am still deciding whether I should continue with it or not as I have seen mixed opinions about this field. Anyway, Here are my options:

First Program Elective:

* Introduction to Cloud Computing
* Android Application Development
* Web Technologies
* ~~Introduction to IOS App Development~~

I've already ruled out IOS App Development. I was leaning towards Cloud Computing, but some friends said it’s mostly theory and not much practical stuff, so I could self-study it. Between Android App Development and Web Technologies, I feel like Web Tech is more relevant these days, but I’m not 100% sure.

Second Program Elective:

* Mobile Computing
* Quantum Computing

I have no clue about either of these. Any insights on which is better, more relevant, etc.?

Third Program Elective:

* Introduction to Internet of Things
* Parallel Computing Algorithms
* ~~3D Printing and Software Tools~~

I’m not interested in 3D Printing and Software Tools. I was thinking of going with IoT, but I don’t know much about Parallel Computing Algorithms. Any advice on choosing between IoT and Parallel Computing?

Thanks in Advance!

6031,Central Processing Unit or Microprocessor? 🤔,">Is there a difference between a CPU and a Microprocessor?

# Background

I'm preparing for the u/CompTIA A+ exam. My current focus is on understanding the processor. 

After reading two articles on the u/IBM website on the subject of processors, I need clarification on a couple of things.

# My Unanswered Questions

1. Is there a difference between a *CPU* and a *Microprocessor*?
   * Is the Microprocessor the evolution of the CPU?
2. Where is the CU and NPU located in relation to the core?

I can see the uses, such as imaging a failing or failed HDD and flashing it to a new drive, or using it as removable media on a virtual machine.  But when installing operating systems, why must the bootable media completely overwrite the existing overhead on a thumb drive and make it appear to be an optical disk?  Why not just delete any existing files and put the OS in a single main folder?  And, to round off my confusion, what is a hybrid ISO and why is it treated differently when creating a bootable drive?

6063,Websites where I can get my CS projects reviewed,"Howdy guys, hope you guys have been doing well. So, I have to get my hands dirty for some projects related to my CS program. I am also engaged in some personal projects that I am doing parallelly with my course work. The problem arises when I need some guidance during the completion of my projects. It's not that the professors are not helpful but they are super busy with other uni stuff so they can't give me one on one advice by breaking down all of the mistakes I did until the project gets finished and I am about to submit it. It creates issues for me as I want my projects to really stand out. But without the necessary guidance from somebody experienced it's hard to do. For side and personal projects the question doesn't even arise.
So, is there any dedicated online community or forum or website where I can showcase my projects to get really well rounded feedback, maybe some inspiration for new projects? I know reddit can help but I want online community solely dedicated on that.

6072,What cs part-time job should I partake while studying medicine?,"Before you tell me ""you'll make more money in medicine than CS"", no.

Just please recommend me something to work while studying in my years of medicine, something to do on the side related to CS that I can do remotely. I recently just finished high school and have some free time on my hands before entering uni. Doesn't have to be programming, can be data science, motion graphics, anything.

I have a lot of experience with programming and took CS as a subject in high school , (nothing complicated or advanced) like python, JS, HTML, CSS, a little bit of C++, I know beginner things.

And I forgot most of these things, though I enjoyed them.

The reason I don't want people telling me that doctors make more than CS and to just answer me is because it's not really the case EVERYWHERE. Where I live, Egypt, you only earn your first salary after a very long time as a med student. And the economy in Egypt is worsening and everyone here wants to migrate, and it's a matter of how much money you make. It's quite really a money battle royale here.

6074,Explaining Chemical dynamics with physics ,"I hate memorizing. Hence why I like physics. To my understanding, physics is all about going from ab initio principles to complex theories defining complex behavior. With that said, I am mostly interested in using physics to explain complex chemical dynamics or molecular mechanics. However if I want if I want to explain such behavior and derive fundamental theories for such behavior, would I benefit from a bachelors in physics and in chemistry. Or would I benefit more from a bachelors in physics and computer science. You see most modern problems from the simulation of chemical dynamics come from a lack of computing power or potential in computers. Hence studying computer science might be more beneficial if I want to address the computational problems in computers so that computers may have the necessary computational power to solve complex chemical dynamics since doing it by hand is not possible. But then again in order to improve computational power and architecture, wouldn’t I need a foundational understanding of physics and chemistry in order to design better systems of computations in computers. Up to my knowledge it’s a problem in the hardware not the software. So I can’t really end up deciding between physics and chemistry or physics and computer science.

 Any thoughts on the matter could be extremely helpful to decide what to do in college. I’m willing to put up with an extra year or two in college if it means achieving my goals.  

PS; I might be overthinking things but I can’t help to think that whatever I study will end up impacting me for the rest of my life. 

My end goal would be to work on the creation of cutting edge material science or understanding the molecular processes of the brain.

However, I still want to keep my options safe for any software roles like in Google, etc. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I need an aerospace degree to do a CS/Aero job in an aerospace company. I would love to be able to do the CS work while applying concepts of aerospace on a project since I love physics/mathematics too.

6178,Memory mapping vs indexing for binaries,"I work on a project that handles multiple binary files of 10 to 100Go. They represent huge float32 matrixes. The data scientists are used to preload the files in RAM, resulting in the group buying tons of RAMs (1To). But they still endup crashing the server multiple times a day.

I did an iterable for them, a simple Python object that holds memory maps of the files (read only, using numpy's memap), so that they can read the matrixes by slicing into them like you would for a regular numpy array. It's quite fast, about 50 lines of code and the data scientists understand it.

A senior dev, who only wants Cpp in the stack, yelled at me saying that memory maps are ""bad"". So he's redoing my iterable in Cpp, and reads the binaries by shifting an index and appending blocks of data into an array.

He did not explain to me why memory maps are ""bad"". Can someone explain to me why moving an index in the binary file is ""much better"" than creating memory maps ? 

And if you have other suggestions on how to handle multiple massive binaries it would be very much welcome !

6181,I made my own distribution sorting algorithm using curve-fitting...,"*(Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub...)*

In the past few days, I was testing different ideas for custom sorting algorithms (using math) in [ArrayV](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayV)(an open-source visualization software for sorting algorithms). Over the course of a few days, I coded up this algorithm: 'curve sort', which I named after [curve-fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting), a core concept used in this sorting algorithm. Below is a GIF visualizing the sorting algorithm with ArrayV.

[GIF visualization of 'curve sort' in ArrayV.](https://i.redd.it/k8egfkfkmiad1.gif)

**Auxiliary array legend (Top-down; the original array is below the auxiliary arrays.):**

1. A histogram, which is later transformed into its [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum).
2. Inverse curve generated using the upscaled/interpolated √n sample.
3. Upscaled/interpolated version of the √n sample, which is later normalized using the maximum/minimum elements.
4. √n sample.
5. The curve-fitted version of the original array before sorting.
6. A one-to-one copy of the original array before sorting; this is used to preserve the values of the original array.



**Explanation of 'curve sort' algorithm:**

1. Obtain the maximum/minimum elements; these will be important later.
2. Generate those 6 arrays mentioned above.
3. Obtain 1 random element from each √n block, and copy those to the corresponding auxiliary array; this is our √n sample.
4. Perform an insertion sort on that √n sample; this is O((√n)^(2)) = O(n).
5. In the corresponding auxiliary array, generate an upscaled/interpolated version of that √n sample connect-the-dots style.
6. Normalize that upscaled/interpolated √n sample, such its range is guaranteed to be \[0, n - 1\]. This is done by doing (y - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1), where y is the value of any given element in that auxiliary array. (Not really visible in this case due to the distribution of the data, but it *is* done.)
7. Iterating over that upscaled/interpolated √n sample again set the value at index y in that 'inverse-function' auxiliary array to x, where x is the index of any given item in that upscaled/interpolated √n sample, and y is the value of said item; this generates an 'inverse function' of the one corresponding to the upscaled/interpolated √n sample.
8. Initialize a 'tracking value' to 0, then, while iterating left-to-right over that 'inverse function' array, set that 'tracking value' to the current maximum element found in that 'inverse function' array. (This works because the 'correct version' is guaranteed to be in order.)
9. Set each element in the curve-fitted copy array to the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the 'inverse function array', and while doing that, increment the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the histogram, where v is the value of any given element in the original array. This will generate a curve-fitted copy of the original array, as well as the histogram.
10. Iterating left-to-right add each element (except for the first element) to the one before it; this will generate a [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) (extremely useful in distribution sorts).
11. Decrementing i from (n - 1) until 0, do this (I will notate in pseudocode): `array[histogramPrefixSum[curveFittedArrayCopy[i]]] = oneToOneArrayCopy[i]` . This generates a almost sorted version of the original array. It still isn't completely sorted though, hence the final step...
12. Do a final insertion sort, this is basically guaranteed to be O(n), as a result of our previous step.

6182,I made my own distribution sorting algorithm using curve-fitting...,"*(Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub...)*

In the past few days, I was testing different ideas for custom sorting algorithms (using math) in [ArrayV](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayV)(an open-source visualization software for sorting algorithms). Over the course of a few days, I coded up this algorithm: 'curve sort', which I named after [curve-fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting), a core concept used in this sorting algorithm. Below is a GIF visualizing the sorting algorithm with ArrayV.

[GIF visualization of 'curve sort' in ArrayV.](https://i.redd.it/ionz952onjad1.gif)



**Auxiliary array legend (Top-down; the original array is below the auxiliary arrays.):**

1. A histogram, which is later transformed into its [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum).
2. Inverse curve generated using the upscaled/interpolated √n sample.
3. Upscaled/interpolated version of the √n sample, which is later normalized using the maximum/minimum elements.
4. √n sample.
5. The curve-fitted version of the original array before sorting.
6. A one-to-one copy of the original array before sorting; this is used to preserve the values of the original array.



**Explanation of 'curve sort' algorithm:**

1. Obtain the maximum/minimum elements; these will be important later.
2. Generate those 6 arrays mentioned above.
3. Obtain 1 random element from each √n block, and copy those to the corresponding auxiliary array; this is our √n sample.
4. Perform an insertion sort on that √n sample; this is O((√n)^(2)) = O(n).
5. In the corresponding auxiliary array, generate an upscaled/interpolated version of that √n sample connect-the-dots style.
6. Normalize that upscaled/interpolated √n sample, such its range is guaranteed to be \[0, n - 1\]. This is done by doing (y - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1), where y is the value of any given element in that auxiliary array. (Not really visible in this case due to the distribution of the data, but it is done.)
7. Iterating over that upscaled/interpolated √n sample again set the value at index y in that 'inverse-function' auxiliary array to x, where x is the index of any given item in that upscaled/interpolated √n sample, and y is the value of said item; this generates an 'inverse function' of the one corresponding to the upscaled/interpolated √n sample.
8. Initialize a 'tracking value' to 0, then, while iterating left-to-right over that 'inverse function' array, set that 'tracking value' to the current maximum element found in that 'inverse function' array. (This works because the 'correct version' is guaranteed to be in order.)
9. Set each element in the curve-fitted copy array to the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the 'inverse function array', and while doing that, increment the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the histogram, where v is the value of any given element in the original array. This will generate a curve-fitted copy of the original array, as well as the histogram.
10. Iterating left-to-right add each element (except for the first element) to the one before it; this will generate a [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) (extremely useful in distribution sorts).
11. Decrementing i from (n - 1) until 0, do this (I will notate in pseudocode): `array[histogramPrefixSum[curveFittedArrayCopy[i]]] = oneToOneArrayCopy[i]`, while decrementing `histogramPrefixSum[curveFittedArrayCopy[i]]`. This generates a almost sorted version of the original array. It still isn't completely sorted though, hence the final step...
12. Do a final insertion sort, this is basically guaranteed to be O(n), as a result of our previous step.

I know it's impossible to actually ""master"" problem solving in two days and that it takes a lot of time but I will still try to maximize my chances.

Here's my plan:

-Learn about best tools/styles used for problem solving in C++ (Since it's the language I will be using)

-Learn general concepts/tools in problem solving such as hashmaps, binary trees and stuff

-Solve A LOT of problems (and use youtube or any help if I got a dead end on any one)

I might be missing something here but I'm trying to understand what's the advantage of using in int, which is 32 bits in length, instead of a 64 bits long type.

In the end of the day, each value will be assigned to one memory address, which is 64-bits in length in a 64-bits architectuer machine. With a simple int, 4 bytes will be unused, right ?

6278,I introduced some optimizations to that 'curve sort' algorithm (a distribution sorting algorithm based around curve-fitting)...,"For context, [I made a curve-fitting based distribution sorting algorithm a few days ago](https://redd.it/1dvdnyt/) (hence the name)...

Before I get into my main explanation, I decided to put the following at the top, since they are a popular type of sorting algorithm-related-video on YouTube...

[**ArrayV**](https://github.com/Gaming32/ArrayV)**(an open-source software) visualizations, before versus after the optimizations:**

* [**BEFORE**](https://imgur.com/a/iSPOLj0)
* [**AFTER**](https://imgur.com/a/8J8wOo4)

Okay, visualizations aside, I realized that while, yes, in the majority of cases, the sorting algorithm was(and is; why else would I have ""optimizations"" in the title?) still O(n), the optimum(only achievable with distribution sorts, like this one here) time complexity for a sorting algorithm, the was still one major O(n^(2)) edge case that I later realized existed...

* Due to selecting the extremum(minimum/maximum) elements from the *entire* array rather than the √n sample, if an extreme outlier existed at all in the array, that would get selected, resulting in a quadratic-time case, due to rounding and resulting lopsided buckets. One optimization I made here is that it will now select only the extremum elements of the √n sample, making this way more likely to be circumvented. Even if an outlier is selected, however, it will still only be O(n^(1.5)), due to step 5 under the ""New set of steps"" section. 
   * \*There are still O(n^(2)) exceptions in theory for that 'extremely skewed samples' issue, but due to the randomness in the sample selection, in practice, this quickly gets astronomically rare for higher n values.

**Other realizations I made in terms of optimizations:**

* I could make the sorting algorithm construct/delete the auxiliary arrays *on the fly*, rather than all at once, meaning you can use less memory at any given time.
* I could consolidate the 2 steps of interpolating/upscaling the √n sample, and generating the inverse function of that curve into 1 step.

**New set of steps**:

1. Obtain 1 random element from each √n block, and copy those to an auxiliary array, which will store our √n sample.
2. Perform an insertion sort on that √n sample array; this is O((√n)^(2)) = O(n).
3. Take the first and last elements of that √n sample array; these are guaranteed to be, respectively, the minimum and maximum elements of that √n sample.
4. Using those extremum elements from that √n sample to 'normalize' it such that the √n sample ranges from 0 to (n - 1). The 0 to (n - 1) range guarantees that the next step is O(n).
5. In the another auxiliary array, generate an 'inverse function curve' of an upscaled/interpolated version of that √n sample; this is done connect-the-dots style (I will refer to this auxiliary array as the 'curve-fitter' array.). 
   * Delete the √n sample array after this, as it is no longer needed.
6. Initialize a 'tracking value' to 0, then, while iterating left-to-right over that 'inverse function' array, set that 'tracking value' to the current maximum element found in that 'inverse function' array to gap-fill it. (This works because the 'correct version' is guaranteed to be in order.)
7. Create a two new auxiliary arrays: a curve-fit data array and a histogram array. Set each element of the curve-fit data array to the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the 'curve-fitter array', and while doing that, increment the element at index ((v - \[Minimum element\]) / (\[Maximum element\] - \[Minimum element\]) \* (n - 1)) in the histogram array, where v is the value of any given element in the original array; this will generate a curve-fit copy of the original array, as well as the histogram. 
   * Delete the 'curve-fitter' array after this, as it is no longer needed.
8. Iterating left-to-right over the histogram array, add each element (except for the first element) to the one before it; this will generate a [prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) (extremely useful in distribution sorts).
9. Duplicate the original array (In my upcoming psuedocode, I refer to this as `orignalArrayDuplicate`.), then, decrementing i from (n - 1) until 0, do this (I will notate in pseudocode): `array[histogramPrefixSum[curveFitDataArray[i]]] = orignalArrayDuplicate[i]`, while decrementing `histogramPrefixSum[curveFitDataArray[i]]`; this generates and an almost sorted (or exactly sorted) version of the original array.
   * Delete all remaining auxiliary arrays after this, as they are no longer needed.
10. Because it isn't guaranteed to be completely sorted, do a final insertion sort, this is O(n) in the majority of cases, as a result of our previous step and sample selection.

**Main changes from the previous iteration(no pun intended) of this sorting algorithm:**

* Removal of a step from before step 1 of obtaining the extremum elements of the entire array, ultimately replaced with step 3 above.
* The arrays are no longer all created or all deleted in one step; they are now created/deleted on the fly.
* Step 5 above is consolidated from what used to be two steps, which were interpolating/upscaling the √n sample, then constructing an 'inverse function' of that.

**As for suggestions...** If anyone commenting has suggestions on how to further optimize this, I would be happy to hear. (:

6310,Feel weird after coding interview,"EE background so im not crazy at coding. 

However I had an interview today for a tech company and for the technical round they presented me with LC medium question on linked lists. I went ahead with C++, and spent majority of my time writing pseudocode and writing basic structure of the process. I have not really memorized every LC solution like a lot of people tend to do since this position also requires a hardware background and some developer skills. 

For the interview however I made sure to talk through each step of my thought process and after reviewing the solution online i was not too far off (i had to implement a while loop with two nested if statements or a for loop, i went with for loop). I did felt like i was taking a long time to answer the hackerank question since we stopped 10 mins before the time was up for me to ask any questions. The interviewers said i was on the right track and chimed in to ask some questions about the thought process and i was able to get to the correct answers and he helped with writing out the start of the function i had to implement . I just felt like i was a bit slow, would this be a huge negative on my chances or am i just overthinking?  

Many have said that technical rounds for this company you do not have to really answer the question perfectly and have it compile, more so explain your reasoning and iterate it to make the process better. He did mention about making it to the next round which is behaviorable round and that the recruiter will reach out on the next steps.

6312,How smart storage aids success,"I was responsible for a budget at work. I got a monthly report showing what items had been charged to it. Each month, without fail, items were charged to my budget that I did not recognise. Brandishing my budget report with the questionable items highlighted, I headed down the corridor to challenge my colleague who allocated charges to budgets. He had around forty piles of paper covering much of the office floor and his desk. It looked chaotic. I’d ask him what the strange items on my budget report related to. He’d thrust his hand into one the piles and extract related documentation. How he know where to look was a mystery. *Which budget do you want me to charge it to?*, he’d ask. I gently suggested that that was his job, not mine. Somehow, I knew I’d be having the same conversation next month.

# Fast data retrieval using caching

In the practical use of intellect, forgetting is as important a function as remembering. - *William James*

Computer caching is a vital optimisation technique where copies of data are stored in a temporary location for faster future access. A cache can be hardware or software based, e.g. CPU cache and browser cache. As data is added to the cache, at some point it will become full. At this point, the question is, what data do we throw out (or forget) to make room for the new data? The most common eviction policies (or *caching algorithms*) used include: *Random Replacement*, *First In First Out (FIFO)* and *Least Recently Used (LRU)*. While each has its own advantages and use cases, *LRU* is often best for minimising data retrieval times.

Aside from the question of what to store in a cache, another is how to organise that content. An economist found himself inundated with information in various forms, including correspondence, papers and reports. He tried various ways to organise the data, ending up with the following approach. Each item was labelled with a title and date then placed vertically in a big box. Three rules were applied: 1. New items were added to the left of the existing ones, 2. When searching for an item, he worked from left to right, 3. When he finished with the item, it was placed to the left of the items in the box. He began to realise that not only was this a simple filing system, it also minimised average retrieval times. This approach represents an extension of the *LRU* rule. In a very appealing twist, when the economist’s box is turned on it’s side, we get a pile. Hence, a pile effectively works as a cache.

# Applying caching to personal productivity

Nothing is less productive than to make more efficient what which should not be done at all. - *Peter Drucker*

The principles of caching help us manage time and resources effectively. Just as computers benefit from reduced data retrieval times, we benefit from reduced cognitive load and fast access to information and tools. Ways I apply these concepts include:

1. **Task prioritisation**A key characteristic of caching is the importance of prioritising frequently used resources. I focus on recurrent or high-impact tasks. By identifying and concentrating on such tasks, I ensure my time and energy are spent on what matters most. Using a strategy like the *LRU* caching algorithm, I prioritise tasks based on their recent importance.
2. **Reducing cognitive load with folders and tools**Just as a cache reduces the need to retrieve data from a slower main memory, having essential data and tools readily available can reduces my cognitive load. On my laptop I have shortcuts to the most frequently and recently used folders. Also, the apps I use most frequently are on the first screen of my *iPhone*.
3. **Minimising decision fatigue**Decision fatigue occurs when the quality of decisions deteriorates after a long session of decision-making. To minimise this, certain decisions can be made in advance. In common with *Mark Zuckerberg*, I wear similar clothes most days. I go to the same coffee shop and buy food from a handful of places.
4. **Automating repetitive tasks**Automation is akin to caching in that it handles repetitive tasks without manual intervention, thus saving time and effort. When I first bought a house, I had many regular bills to pay. However, sometimes I would forget to pay them. I got myself into a real muddle, including receiving a court summons for non payment of *Council Tax*. My life massively improved when I setup *Direct Debits* for all regular bills.

6332,Why does STL need normal vectors?,"According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)): ""An STL file describes a raw, unstructured triangulated surface by the unit normal and vertices (ordered by the right-hand rule)."" Supposedly, this is in order to specify the outside vs the inside of an object described in STL. However, if we're already using the right-hand rule, then the order of the three vertices already specifies which way outside is, as indeed they already specify the normal vector itself: it is the cross product of the triangle's sides.

It seems to me that including the normal vector:

* increases the file size considerably
* opens us up to inconsistent specifications (as in, we might give a normal that's not unit length or isn't actually perpendicular to the triangle specified by the vertices)

In exchange we get what to make this tradeoff worth it? All I could think of is that we save computing time when processing the file: should we need the normal vector, we won't have to cross-multiply the sides. Even that is arguable, as we pay for this when constructing the file: we'll have to cross-multiply the sides to get the normal to save to the file during construction. This hardly seems worth.

I know I'm not the first one to raise this issue, but I haven't found a satisfying answer on the internet yet. This file format (as all other file formats) was devised by people much smarter than me, who almost definitely considered these facts when coming up with the idea of STL. Can any of you enlighten me what the rationale behind the inclusion of normal unit vectors is?",1720521907,393513,gaalbeast,t2_4i4ztk,f85b4bc7fd6b21b207a0435df862234687a3a7cfe0b54b95ec7ca3e3089a857e,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1dyzbhi/why_does_stl_need_normal_vectors/

6346,Should i start in the spring or fall CS MAJOR,"Hey everyone! I graduated last month and I'm thinking about starting college in the spring. I'm concerned that this might put me behind my fellow 2024 graduates in computer science. I've been teaching myself to code and studying CS over the past few weeks to try to gain an advantage, but I'm unsure if starting in the spring is a good idea. The reason I'm considering this is because I'm saving up for a car. A family member suggested to my parents that starting in the spring would be better since I don't currently have a car to commute to school in person.

So, my question is: should I start in the spring and potentially miss out on starting with my peers, or should I start this fall and juggle online and in-person classes while sharing a family car that might be needed at any time?

I want some of your guidance on how to land a job in dev field when I am a tester in my current company. I researched around a bit to find people saying that making projects can be useful. But is this the only way? What if I join a 6 month course for Full stack development,bootcamps or even pursue an internship 

You see I did create some projects during my college time but that didn’t land me any call from any companies that I applied for a dev role

I also really wish to work in Full Stack development,tho people say Datascience has more future but I find Datascience boring. Also what can help me if I learn Full Stack? What kind of networking should I do? Will my resume look good if I present a Full stack project?

6375,PyPI package for Semantic Routing,"Hi everyone,
I wanted to share a project I've been working on called SemRoute, and I would love to get your feedback. SemRoute is a semantic router that uses vector embeddings to route queries based on their semantic meaning. It's designed to be flexible and easy to use, without the need for training classifiers or using large language models.
Here's a brief overview:
- Supports multiple embedding models (OpenAI, MistralAI)
- Support custom embedding models
- Offers dynamic and static thresholding
- Allows different scoring methods (individual averaging, centroid)

You can check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/HansalShah007/semroute. I'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from this community on how to improve it or use cases you think it might be suited for.

Hey everyone,

I'm a student trying to decide between IT and CSE specializations like AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) and AIDS (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science). I've heard mixed opinions on this – some people say that specializing can decrease versatility and make you less preferable to companies. and also specializations degree don't even count a proper degree outside in big MNCs?

-Some are saying IT ppls do hardware type jobs in future and don't rely on specializations and put cse specializations over IT

Could you share your insights on this? Is it better to go for a general IT/CSE degree, or should I go for a specialization? Which option is more valued by companies for further placements and best insights.

6497,What is binary (numerical base)?,"This term deals with digits and numbers.

Let’s treat with what are digits and numbers.

**A digit is a symbol used to represent a number whom itself represents quantity**. **But digits are also numbers while numbers aren‘t** (only 0 to 9)

**In decimal there is 10 digits used before we start adding another digit to a number**, and that‘s why 10 is composed of 2 digits (which isn‘t the case for all the numerical base), **indeed we form packs of 10**
And it stay that way for 100, 100 is 100*1 or 10*10. **Yes each positions switch of values**. 
From right to left it is multiplied by 10, units represent 1 digit being used, dozens represent 2 digits being used and by keeping like that hundreds represent 3 digits being used.
**In other words it means UNIT*1, DOZEN*10, HUNDRED*100, they are power of 10 because made of 10 digits.**

As I said earlier, **other numerical bases are differents** as **they are made of less digits or extra digits.**
**For example binary means 2 digits 
(0 to 1)**leading to packs of 2 like when 1 is exceeded it becomes 10 so it‘s 2 in decimal, for 3 it‘s 11 but for 4 it‘s 100 **since the unit and the dozen exceeded 1**

From right to left first digit is multiplied by 1, second is multiplied by 2 and third is multiplied by 4. the hundred in binary are 2 pack of 2 packs, fourth position is 2 packs of 2 packs of 2 packs, they are power of two.
 
**Each position is worth a power of 2 starting by 0 (**growing by 1**) and **the digit needs to be multiplied by the concerned power of 2**, for the first position or zeroth (0 in binary context to match the power of 2) the power is 0 because simply for the fact  it’s not yet packs being made, it’s **INDIVIDUAL**

I'm a self-taught programmer and I learn stuff by learning about the history of them. Whatever I learn, I start reading about its history from day 1 to the current day. What I need is a list of influential people in the field of CS so that I can follow their work to understand everything better (this is just the way I teach myself :D)

TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  
RAG functions like a student in an open-book exam. When faced with a question, the student can look up the latest information in textbooks or online resources, ensuring their answer is accurate and up-to-date.

6517,Partitioning secondary indexes of database by term and by document,"I am going through the Chapter 6 in the book Designing data intensive applications (First edition). Here, it was mentioned that the method used by to partition secondary indexes of database by term can handle read queries by secondary index faster than the partitioning by document. The method mentioned was to partition the secondary indexes (terms) based on the sorted order. The question here is are we storing all the documents that are referenced by the secondary index by a partition are stored in that partition or they are randomly distributed. If they are randomly distributed, wouldn't that require the calls to other partitions resulting in the read query being slower than the partition by document? Else if the documents referenced by the secondary indexes are stored in the same partition, wouldn't that increase skewed partition potentially resulting in the bottleneck? 

Please someone clarify this to me.",1721146233,394404,moriarty_loser,t2_7w45jsyf,836b6c2f709dff8f4ec66ad44c5359a2cebabf2e917945073aad3b2b13cb0a7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1e4skw0/partitioning_secondary_indexes_of_database_by/

6522,Now I know What infinite loops are!!!,"I'm working my chess engine as my final project. And I'm stuck with an infinite loop!

I've got several methods that depend on each other, viz.:
updateLegalMoves();
calculatePotentialMoves();
isLegalMove();
kingInCheck();
copyBoard();

The last method that I defined is kingInCheck() that check whether a particular move would put the king in check and if so, remove that move from legalMoves array.

### Where does my infinite loop start?
- Well, when I call kingInCheck() it calls copyBoard() which in turn calls updateLegalMoves() which calls calculatePotentialMoves() and isLegalMove()!!!

- Now, where ever I might call kingInCheck() it would cause an infinite loop!

##### What solutions do I have?
- I was going to have a long sentence on probable solutions but to be honest I really don't know how to break out it.

6548,Need advice ,"I have been working since 2017.  I left a company after being there for 1.5 years and joined a start up.  I was misled about what I would be doing here.  Instead of working in AI related stuff, they had me building pdfs full time and I hated it.  Unfortunately, 6months in, COVID started and I panicked about losing my shitty job since I need income to support my family.  Unfortunately, in a meeting I suggested to this person that he could use k-nearest algorithm to get the answer he wanted.  He didn’t know what it was and so I offered help.  2 minutes after the meeting ends, I get fired by my boss since he felt I wasn’t giving 100% to building pdfs.  So now I have 8m of pdf experience which I want to leave off my resume.  I then find a contract IT role (since it’s Covid and I needed income) and after joining this bank doing contract IT, I realized that the team was really bad.   They had 16k lines of python code and wanted me to debug where the error was coming from.   I just couldn’t handle working for this team and found another contract IT job at a different bank.  However again, this particular contract IT job had completely misrepresented the role to me. I was supposed to join as a quant developer at an interest rates team, but I ended up joining an esg desk using Java/splunk.  I started panicking as I never mentioned I knew either of these technologies and lo and behold, 6m later I get fired. 

I literally have 1.5 years of bullshit experience that I don’t know how what to do with.  

Is it possible for me to reset my career ?  Or am I doomed for life? I have strong knowledge of big data/asynchronous programming.    I then find another contract role at Facebook and it was an amazing experience.  However 9m in, they asked me to join full time and hence I went through an interview and in 3rd round, they stopped the interview process as there was a hiring freeze. 

I’m literally getting frustrated by now.  I then within 2 weeks, join this crypto start up where I ended up building all their tech stack, got raving reviews and lo and behold, 8 months in, the company goes out of business.  

I then again found another contract job at one of the previous banks I worked for in a commodities trading group, liked what I did, but felt it was too slow and I was being underutilized.  I get poached by a low latency team at a different bank and hence I left to join as a vp.  Then 1.5 years later, this new bank tells me that they need to cut costs and that I should be willing to move out of the country if I want to keep my job.  I refused and hence resigned with good reviews.  

Now my problem is, I have too many companies in my resume in such short period of time that it’s ringing alarm bells. I woudjnt even want to hire me if I saw all this happen to a person. 

I recently made it to a final round at this company and the guy got upset I had so many jobs and decided to pass up on me even though I destroyed their technical assessment.  

What am I supposed to do to reset my life so that companies don’t think of me as a hiring risk?  I’m forced to take another contract job just to support myself and my mom.  

My dad died few months ago and it’s been insanely stressful for me.  Thanks ",1721243698,394569,Shadow_Wolf_2983,t2_4l0y6pz5a,48c17c4ed5cd0badd8d773e44f544e79bbaa3bee0debf36e0bc5bb4b698588f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1e5qo6n/need_advice/

6564,Is my understanding of alpha fold 2 in protein folding correct ?,"

# 

Please point out if I got something wrong or that I don't understand something

This info is mostly taken from what other people on reddit commented

AlphaFold 2 is not the only AI system working on protein folding and that AlphaFold 3 already exists.

There is sequence - structure. Given this string of amino acids, roughly how will it fold up based on all the other structures we've seen. Huge caveat... that training data is biased to well studied proteins and those that are most amendable to making crystal structures. Then there is structure -> function. What does this protein actually do? What reactions does it catalyze? How does it interact with other proteins?

The real goal here is sequence - function.

It's a misnomer to say it solves the folding problem because it doesn't take folding events into account. It predicts the end structure of a protein that has already folded, it is useful for structural predictions from sequences. It doesn't actually tell us much, if anything, about the folding pathways that a polypeptide takes to get to the folded state. With that being said, AF is really good at predicting structures of independently folding domains from sequence alone, better than any other tool has previously. Even when it hasn't seen structural templates of your protein before, it still does an incredible job.

AF is really good for generating hypotheses and allowing us to better choose where to focus resources in research. The predicted structure can give hints about associated function and also enables us to find out what is known about similar structures. Instead of stumbling in the dark, it can give us a head start, with a high degree of confidence. It isn't always correct, very long multi-domain proteins are scrunched up when in reality they're elongated, multi-protein complexes aren't predicted with as high confidence, and it isn't able to incorporate many non-proteinaceous cofactors (a handful can now be incorporated such as ATP), among other criticisms.

AF2 is good with proteins that are similar to ones that it has seen in the training data. It is decent with soluble monomer (single subunit) proteins (better than other methods). And even with soluble monomers, it's decent in getting the overall shape right, but there's usually some regions that are predicted pretty badly",1721317770,394670,ICEpenguin7878,t2_vhlwqioxc,12e7a022ef3927ee2c62a7cb3ac0e9e311b4610263a17bb3292d0cc1b73c1c84,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1e6eroh/is_my_understanding_of_alpha_fold_2_in_protein/

6575,Looking for study material on low-level programming and computer operation,"I've been studying programming since I was 8 years old, I started creating games in scratch, construct, unity... since 2021 I've been focused on web and application development, doing projects in both the backend and frontend, having already worked as a freelancer in game creation and creating a website for a local company, in addition to some personal projects

I'm Brazilian and I moved to the United States 2 months ago, I'm going to 10th grade and I want to take a class in computer science honors

Even though I have already participated in some competitions with C, I still don't know much about low-level languages ​​and I don't have in-depth knowledge of how a computer works, logic gates, etc.

I have an idea about hardware because of a computer I built a little over a year ago, but it's still very superficial knowledge

I'm not finding a lot of good content about low-level programming and how a computer works over the internet, I also have no idea what the class can cover

6592,"Help! Bugs Keep Showing Up in Production, Even After Testing","Hi everyone, I'm currently in a trainee program to become a professional Software Developer (and will be entering my 3rd year in August).

I'm working on web applications for different systems, often automating some kind of process (e.g., reading and processing CSV data, automating REST requests to third-party systems, the usual stuff). 

I'm running into a frustrating problem: even though I thoroughly test each application myself before release, and one of my PMs then tests it again on a test system, customers still encounter bugs when they use the app on the production system. 

This isn't just annoying because a faulty product was delivered, but it also annoys and shames me that I'm responsible for it not working because case X wasn't considered. 

What can I do to improve in this regard and make sure I catch these issues earlier? 

Here's what I'm looking for advice on:

Testing Strategies: How do you approach testing for web applications? What types of tests are essential, beyond unit and integration tests? Are there specific methodologies or frameworks you recommend for JS and PHP applications? While my company doesn't currently use any form of testing, I believe it would be beneficial to implement them. Although our development time is limited, I think the advantages of testing outweigh the time investment.

Edge Case Identification: How do you effectively identify and test for edge cases and unexpected user inputs that might not be obvious during initial testing? 

Collaboration and Communication: Are there any specific ways to improve communication and collaboration with PMs and the customer to identify potential issues earlier in the development process?  
Our working-process consists of me receiving some form of task: E.g. to implement a way of importing CSV-Data, with a very rough description of what to do - but I don't really know, what the end-result has to look like and what details to consider during development.  
I am afraid, that I will be overlooking some very basic Edge-Cases or different ""usual problems"".

Our stack is JS and PHP. Any tips on testing in this environment or for improving as a developer in general would be greatly appreciated!

6613,I feel lost in computer science,"Hello! 

Hope everyone is doing alright! 

I want to come here and share something that has been making me feel bad for the past months, in hopes I find an answer for it!

I just now entered my second year of university and I major, obviously, in computer science. However, I feel like I have learned nothing.. I aced all my math courses (Discrete Math, Probability, Linear, Numerical...) and all my programming courses as well (C++, Python, Java...) but I still don't feel like I know anything. 

I can program stuff and yeah they will have cool outputs. However, I know nothing about how my programming skills will be applied in the work field or how I can merge two programming languages into one (for example to make a game or a website). I just feel like I know nothing except of rules and applications.

Can anyone please help me know why I feel that way? And if I want to learn the stuff I am curious about, I just have 0 idea how to phrase them in Youtube and other sites. 

Did you guys ever feel lost in your computer science journey? How did you overcome it? And did you manage to find a job? How did you apply your knowledge into it? I am planning on becoming a software engineer or an AI researcher/developer.

tl;dr I know all the rules and applications of computer science but I have 0 idea at the same on how to apply them in the work field and other stuff.

P.S. I heavily apologize if my questions sound ignorant or uneducated, I just am worried if I only feel that way or if there is other people who share the same journey as me.

6617,Can anyone explain how does VHDX files cannot be deleted through GUI?,"I wanted to dualboot W11 and Linux Mint so I created a VHDX file, and after trying a few times I couldnt do it thus i gave up. Then when I wanted to delete the file it didnt let me because for some reason it was open and I couldnt find it, even in Process explorer.

Then somebody suggested me to run this:

1. Run `list vdisk` to displays the attached virtual disks.
2. If the vhdx is listed, run `select vdisk file=""<vhdx file path>""` to select the specified virtual disk.
3. Run `detach vdisk` to detach the selected virtual disk

This somehow worked.

The thing I am curious about is, why did this work and why couldnt I manually close it from the Process Explorer GUI? Why wasnt it listed there?

Thanks for the support!

As of recently I have been working through CS50 and rediscovering my love for programming (did this as an A-level but had terrible teaching so hated it). Do you think it's worth potentially going back to university and doing a conversion masters in the field so I can pivot into a software engineering role?

6703,Account Abstraction in Blockchain: A Brief Overview,"**Account abstraction** in blockchain technology allows for more flexible and adaptable account models beyond traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contracts.

In Ethereum, this feature lets developers create custom account types with unique logic and rules. Unlike conventional blockchains, where private keys control public addresses and sign transactions, Ethereum enables the design of accounts with their own code and functionality, offering greater freedom and extensibility. This innovation broadens the scope of blockchain applications by allowing accounts to be customized beyond the standard models.

**Use Cases** of Account Abstraction in Blockchain:

- Create dynamic fee models based on transaction size, complexity, or priority.

- Set access limits based on time, location, or specific conditions.

- Build accounts with privacy features like zero-knowledge proofs for confidential transactions.

- Enable unique accounts to facilitate asset transfers and data exchange between blockchains.

6725,Decentralizing the Internet,"what if we reallllly fully decentralized the internet and made it safe and open and fun again

like a free alternative to the current internet crawling (google/bing/etc) that allows for things like people and communities to own and customize the page that comes up for their search, rather than having a third-party sum up and present the indexed info

something that allows for archival scroll so that you can define access by time and have it allow for live records 

move servers to regulated regional distributions and have server communities which are more sustainably powered due to their smaller sizes, open source global platforms that are seeded into one another and run their own cross-security in real time

codified translation built in for personal use so the UI is immediately accessible for everyone 

an option for build-your-own-keyboard style customization, key-by-key binding for custom characters sorted by language groupings, allows for individualization, prevents data skimming if you want to type like a cryptic menace, and allows for lesser known languages to be used w more ease

federated search networks with decentralized ecosystems allowing for full transparency, universal indexing categorized by the opt-in nature of the web as it grows, the ability to truly SEE everything and not be able to hide from the public eye so the creeps can't just exist freely anymore (they already have the dark web, they can stay there) 

total user data encryption and transparency of data handling (like sewage, can be used for research and analytics but not tracked to individuals unless tagged/flagged for illicit content, at which point pedophiles should all be shot and shamed publicly)

collaborative creative freedom, customization of landing pages and home pages, kind of like wikipedia/reddit/myspace but for everything, made colorful and with people adding their own sound files and pictures and you can upload kids' drawings or poetry and see the concept across space and time and sort by color and medium (somehow regulated through AI and human filters before display, this is the biggest reach lmao)

and like maybe your server community is like ""it's illegal to be a furry"" and that offends you so you persist, it wouldn't stop you from accessing it if you managed to, but you'd have a record and maybe they just wouldn't let you work at the animal shelter anymore

just meant to spark thoughts and discussion, I can't wait to hear all about how and why it won't work haha",1721858748,395638,fbnaqvi,t2_izemp,bfd8056386460ac63a2f340f9155152f9a7e25d474d4b9646a2becf1060485c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ebe3ak/decentralizing_the_internet/

*10 home devs from all around the country have been selected to participate in the ultimate challenge. Becoming the one and only Master Dev and the price of 250 000 dollars!!*



\* Contestants are entering the Master Dev Openspace \*



John confess

Wow !! I’ve never seen an openspace that big. Must be quite noisy during all these daily meeting, exciting stuff.



Jessica confess

My dad is still a junior dev at 45. I want to make my family proud and becomes the ultimate Master Dev.



\* Camera zoom on Gordon Ramsey

Welcome to Hell’s review. You all want to win the title of Master Dev. But only one of you can go home with this title and all the prestige it goes with it.



Jessica confess

I want to win



To test your knowledge, I will be assist by to of the most reknowned names in the programming langage industry : Lead data evangelist enthusiast Graham Eliott, he has two silver badges on Stack Overflow and a positive karma on reddit. As well as Joe Bastianich who has bought 1 bitcoin in 2019.



Coleen confess

Things just got super real



Andrew confess

I’ve learned coding thanks to r/ProgrammerHumor so I’m ready to kick some ass lol... That’s cringe... I use ArchLinux by the way.



You’re going to participate in your first pressure test challenge. For this challenge you’ll have 1 hour to create a simple Hello World program. Sounds easy ? It’s not. You can choose whatever programming language you want. The challenge starts now.



Coleen confess

It’s crunch time baby !



\* Gordon Ramsey goes see how Coleen is doing

So Coleen, how are you going to do that challenge ?

So for the OS, I’m running on a Windows 11 machine, I’ll use VSCode as my IDE and Python as my programming langage.

That’s it ? You want to play it safe ? You know it takes a lot to become a Master Dev right ? Have you thought about the performance of your program ? One of you is going home tonight. Bloody hell !

\* Camera zooms to Andrew trying to install ArchLinux

\* Camera zooms to John compiling his program in C++

\* Camera zooms to clock

It’s over guys bring me back those merge requests. Andrew you’re the first one up.

\* Andrew gives his computer.

Bloody hell ! Graham ! Joe ! Come see this. That’s…

\* 10 minutes of advertisements

That’s splendid ! The use of Rust, the try/catch, the branching model : superb. I personnaly prefer vim over vi but that’s an amazing effort. You are qualified for the next round.

John, you are the next one up !

\* John’s brings his computer to the front desk

Allright John, describe your MR please.

So you’ve got a HelloWorldFactory on top of a HelloWorldFactoryBuilder. I also used a HelloWorldFactoryBuilderAdapter to spice things up with a mixed tender HelloWorldFactoryAdapterDecorator. It’s juicy, it’s flavorfull, home devs are gonna love it.

\* Joe Bastianich looks at John

John, that MR is disgusting, I don’t know what you cooked at your desk for a hour back there but it’s all other the place. My grandma can make better code. You’re everything that is wrong with this profession. Put your Jabra headphones off. You’re out of this competition.



*Next time on Hell’s Review*

\* Camera zooms to angry Gordon Ramsey

What the hell is that branching model ! I told you to keep it simple. You already have 4 rebase going on. And stash those commits for god’s sake.

*Our nine remaining home devs are cooking a delicious login endpoint. Who will be eliminated next ?

6741,AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data,"
How AI Models Miss Out on Learning When Only Given AI-Made Data

TL;DR
When AI models are trained on data generated by other AI models, they gradually forget the original types of information they were supposed to learn. This problem, called ""model collapse,"" results in the AI models becoming less accurate over time.

Detailed Explanation
Imagine you’re learning to make pancakes. If you learn from someone who is experienced, you’ll get better each time. But what if you only learn from someone who just learned from someone else, and this cycle goes on and on without anyone ever having made pancakes before? Over time, the recipe might end up missing crucial details, leading to really bad pancakes.

The Problem:
AI models (like those that generate text or images) need a lot of data to learn and get better. Usually, this data comes from things humans have created. But what happens when AI models start learning from data that other AI models produced? It turns out, it’s like the pancake scenario—they start forgetting important parts of the information they originally learned.

What is ""Model Collapse""?
Model collapse happens when AI models are fed too much AI-generated data, causing them to gradually lose touch with the original variety and detail of human-created data. This means the models start producing less accurate and more repetitive outputs over time.

1. Loss of Information: AI gradually forgets uncommon but important details.

2. Repetitiveness: AI-generated data tends to become monotonous and predictable.

3. Long-Term Decline: Over many generations of learning from AI-generated data, the AI’s performance degrades.

Why It Matters:
This degeneration is critical because many modern applications of AI, from text generation to image processing, rely on accurate and varied data. Imagine if a self-driving car or a voice assistant started making more errors because the training data was increasingly inaccurate. This would be both frustrating and potentially dangerous.

Real-Life Example:
Researchers discovered that when a language model (like GPT) is trained on text produced by another language model rather than humans, over time, it starts to generate gibberish or repetitive phrases. For instance, earlier generations might produce coherent sentences, but later versions might repeat words or lose the context entirely.

So, just like the pancake recipe that gets worse the more it deviates from the original, AI models can lose their effectiveness if they keep learning from AI-generated content instead of high-quality human data.

I’m an experienced fullstack developer. But my freelancing projects are few and far in between. I mainly chose this field because I was told that I never be out of a job and that even if I’m in between official jobs, I can take on freelancing.

 But that seems not to be the case. I’ve tried. I’ve tried up and between having to pay just for connect to being ghosted and to have nobody clicking on my service I’m at my wits end.

6755,Is it a good approach?,"Hi everyone. I'm working on a game engine as a hobby. One of my great problems is how to store my game objects. Since I'm using OOP and component paradigm, I have game object classes which inherit from an abstract class. I thought I can have a vector which stores shared pointers of the abstract class.
Whenever a new game object is about to be made, I use `make_shared<class type>` to make a new instance of the game object class then check if any of the elements of the vector is null or not. If there isn't any empty position,  I push the new one back to the vector. And if there is an empty position, I set it to the new shared pointer. And if there is an empty position, I simply assign it to the new pointer.
And also, I return a weak pointer to the new object to keep the reference count 1.
Whenever a game object requests to be destroyed, I simply set it to null in the vector. Because the reference count is 1, it becomes zero and the object gets destroyed.

Is this a good approach?",1721936542,395764,LooksForFuture,t2_af77i18u,03f3d6cc548f2fd1aef3f0bb2df1674703d45ea6cd19c0d6919e2a8cfcaf0f14,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ec3z7d/is_it_a_good_approach/

Despite it having bloatware, i have never noticed it impeding on what i am doing at any point and always felt very content with it, i love the GUI as well. Honestly i prefer it to W10 by far and as for the Linux argument i got into, I am using Linux rn on my laptop to write this, and thats only because my laptop has horrendous specs compared to my main PC.

6798,I really enjoy coding (so far anyway). Any other jobs that employ/utilize/activate similar traits that *aren’t* in saturated job markets? ,"I really enjoy coding. I enjoy the puzzle aspect of it. The logic. The figuring out a way to employ a solution. Seeing and feeling the results of my code working as intended. 

I even enjoy when it *doesn’t* work, and the subsequent “digging in” to find out what’s “wrong”. 

But all the signs point to me just being one of many new people to this field. And that the market is saturated (especially for entry level etc)

Friends I have in the industry tell me it’s all about your skills. If you can show your work, that’s how you get hired etc… is that true?

Anyway, whether it is or isn’t, what I’m wondering is, are there *any* other jobs where I can utilize similar skills and activate similar parts of my brain etc… that are in markets that are *not* saturated? 

I’m hearing general IT and possible cyber security? 

Preferably ability to do remote as well.

6824,I am confused how  Vector Clocks offer anything over Quorum when ensuring an event or key write happens after another event. ,"Node A gets a write for Key '1'. Value ""Blue"" The Vector clock is \[1,0,0\] 

Node B gets a write for Key'1 ""Red""'. 

  
In scenario 1, Node A sends a message to Node B before Node B gets the new write. There is now consensus that Key 1 is Red, and the vector clocks is \[1,1,0\].

If we had used Quorum instead, the majority of nodes would have initially agreed its Red. Then initially agreed its Blue.

  
In both scenarios you would need writes to be propogated ASAP across the cluster.

  
Scenario 2 - The message to Node B hasn't arrived and it sets Key 1 to Blue and the vector clock for this record is \[0,1,0\].

  
Now there is no consensus.

And vector clocks are equally useless as Quorum and you would need conflict resolution on a quorum read regardless. 

  
The one scenario I can think of is if you have two fast writes to Node A, ""Green"" and then ""Red"", but the ""Red"" message propogates to other nodes before the Green - the vector clock would ensure that ""Green"" is actually the latest update.

6836,Extending a signed integer but keeping its sign and numerical value,"Hi,

I'm currently reading *Computer Systems: a Programmer's Perspective*, specifically the part on type conversions. Here's what it says about converting a signed integer of a certain size to a bigger size:

>“For converting a two's-complement number to a larger data type, the rule is to perform a sign extension, adding copies of the most significant bit to the representation, expressed by the following principle.”

So if I understand correctly, that means that the value 1101, when expanded to be 8 bits, becomes 11111101. The most significant bit representing the sign (1) is copied 4 times to the left of the value.

This does keep the sign, but the value itself is completely changed ! Yet, the book later gives this example :

>“sx = –12345:	cf c7  
usx = 53191:	cf c7  
x = –12345:	ff ff cf c7  
ux = 53191:     00 00 cf c7”

What I'm looking at here are the values of sx and x, which is basically the same value of x but extended to a larger format. How is the computer supposed to know that the first 4 `f`s (not including the sign) should be ignored ?

  
Am I missing something here ?",1722262793,396365,to_fl,t2_z8ccx,a28bba61fd54177f558a6a2301d1cd46b26baf1d6b00507cf54efe688d2e91e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ef0qaa/extending_a_signed_integer_but_keeping_its_sign/

6838,Careers in BioInformatics/ health care ,"While I finish my CE BS; I want to join the Navy reserves as a Hospital Corpsman with a specialization in field/combat medicine. Is their any way to blend these two careers or should I just learn the most that I can as a health care specialist then pursue computer engineering on my own time for job satisfaction/personal enjoyment after I get out of the Navy if I do join?

I like algorithms and hope to be focused more on that side of the house with a deep understanding of the physical part of the computer, I don’t want to design hardware.

A few local colleges here in the SF Bay Area offer biomedical engineering majors (SFSU,SJSU, CSUEB,UCB, etc) but BioMed seems to be more mechanical while software interests me a lot more.

I don't know why this is so much harder than for example learning all of Physics 2 in 10 days or calc 2 in 7, I think that just the way of thinking is too different.

so anyway all of this causes me to feel overwhelmed and Procrastinate instead of studying, So hopefully people here have some advice for me to learn, what I think my problem essentially is, is that I'm not ""tuned in"" for solving these problems right now, solving these problems require a certain way of looking at problems which I don't have, but I think I'm capable as math feels almost natural to me so I think I can learn this with the right resources.",1722279520,396412,Marvellover13,t2_17twn878,d5f09b09194233b3cdda3c571e11bc5fadf2a6f90747de1be636ead1fcfffaea,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ef7nu9/ive_got_a_final_in_data_structures_and_algorithms/

6884,Question about strong consistency in distributed systems,"In Alx Xu's ""System Design Interview, Volume 1"", on page 105 he describes the consensus quorum method for achieving consistency for in a distributed key-value store. In this method, N is the number of replicas, W is the size of a ""write quorum"" and R is the size of a ""read quorum"". Then, a write is considered successful only once W replicas acknowledge a write operation, and a read is successful only once R replicas return a result (presumably the same result, he just doesn't say this explicitly). Note that W is NOT the number of replicas the data gets copied to, just the number that need to acknowledge the write.

On the next page, he says that strong consistency is guaranteed if W+R>N because ""there must be one overlapping node that has the latest data to ensure consistency"".

But then, further down the page he says ""Strong consistency is usually guaranteed by forcing a replica not to accept new reads/writes until **every replica** has agreed on current write."" Huh?? This seems to contradict the quorum consensus strategy, which specifically does not wait for **every** node to agree, only W nodes.

6893,Is Writing a Chess Program in C# for a High Distinction Grade in 3 Months Feasible?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a university student tasked with writing a chess program in C# for a high distinction grade, and I've got about 3 months to complete it. The project requires the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and I’m wondering if it’s possible to achieve this goal within the given timeframe. I’d appreciate any insights on the feasibility and the time commitment needed.

Here are a few details:

Language: C#

OOP Requirement: Need to implement OOP principles effectively

Grade Goal: High Distinction

Deadline: 3 months

Scope: No AI implementation, just 2 human players

My Questions:

1. Feasibility: Is it realistic to complete a chess program at a high distinction level in 3 months?

2. Time Commitment: How many hours per week should I expect to dedicate to this project?

3. Key Considerations: What are the critical elements I need to focus on to ensure the program meets high distinction criteria?

4. Learning Curve: How steep is the learning curve for implementing a full-fledged chess program in C# using OOP?

5. Resources: Any recommended resources or tips for tackling such a project?

My Background:

- I have a decent understanding of C# and OOP concepts.

- I have worked on smaller projects but nothing as complex as a chess program.

I’m eager to hear from anyone who has undertaken similar projects or has experience in developing chess programs. Any advice, tips, or experiences you could share would be immensely helpful!

Thanks in advance!

6904,[OS] How is it possible for an interrupt to occur while the OS is already using the CPU?,"I was reading through OSTEP [Chapter 6](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eremzi/OSTEP/cpu-mechanisms.pdf), bottom of page 11, and the author mentioned that

> the OS does indeed need to be concerned as to what happens if, during interrupt or trap handling, another interrupt occurs.

Assuming there's only 1 CPU (ignoring multiprocessor systems because the answer is obvious), only one process can physically run at a time, whether it's an ordinary program or the OS itself. That's the whole point of the interrupt, since it returns control to the OS from whatever program is currently running.

My question is, aren't system calls, traps, etc. only raised by programs when they're running on the CPU? That is, if the OS is already running in order to handle one system call, isn't it impossible for anything else to use that same CPU and thus generate a system call itself?

6911,How best to expand my skillset - Senior in BS Comp Sci,"Long story short, I'm a senior at a university studying Comp Sci, Minor in Math, and all of my classes so far have been all theory. I've purposefully signed up for every class I can that does projects and hands-on work such as a Game Dev class that will be developing a chemistry safety lab simulation in VR. I've had 2 internships, one for a public school system where I developed apps, interacted with clients, represented big data, etc. using Microsoft PowerPlatform, and now i do ML Research on CNNs for the US SMDC. However, I'm not into theoretical research. i want a job that uses hands-on experience and solves problems using technology. I would be happy even consulting Businesses on what technology and practices or consulting people on how to build PCs. However, i need competitive skills that could land me either a job in Hawaii (military spouse) or a remote job. In-demand skills that I've seen are Linux (Systems Administrator), Python and R, Tableau, Cloud Based Systems, and SQL. So my question is, what skills (including the ones mentioned) are going to give me a competitive edge and how can I learn those skills best? I have done part 1 of a Linux Fundamentals course on Tryhackme, which I was introduced to through DayZero, our cybersecurity competition organization on campus (I am not interested in Cybersecurity sadly and left). I'm personally leaning towards SQL and Linux. Also, i would have to learn all of these skills independently of my university because.... my college honestly sucks. Additionally, should i start applying to federal positions before graduations? I know most of them require security clearances and I can't get those clearances until i have a conditional job offer from one of the agencies. I've heard federal/ military contractor jobs are the easiest to get in Hawaii especially as a military spouse.

6915,"I designed a little protocol for reducing the size of files before storing them in a database, and I need feedback on it","Hello everyone, I had a little idea I wanted to get some feedback on.

So for a university project, I was working a lot with 3D data files, specifically .OBJ, and I ran into problems with huge sizes of some files and limited storage. So I started thinking of reducing the sizes of the files.

The idea that I came up with was to systematically strip away data from a file, essentially corrupting it, but in a way such that later when I retrieve it, I can reverse the process and give all the data back to it.

For reference, OBJ files look something like this

v 0.123 0.874 0.237

This line defines one vertex point, and each files contains tens of thousands of these.

What I did was write a little script to combine these three numbers using cantor pairing function, which is reversible. The function works only on natural numbers, so first I make the numbers positive by adding 1 to them (in case they are not already positive), and make them into whole numbers by multiplying them by a power of 10 that is huge enough (10\^6 has worked for me).

The problem with this is, the resulting number is huge, so what I do is convert it to to base 64, and finally store it.

Then when I retrieve the file, I just reverse the whole process, theoretically getting my original file back (in practice it got a little tricky, since I am dealing with high precision floats).

I have tried it out, and it works, but I was just wondering if this scheme is a reliable or not. And maybe there is a better way to do this that I am just missing.

I'd really appreciate some input.",1722463089,396764,Black_Bird00500,t2_2xkx1san,50469cb941099f1bd9321872789cecf8525626261607fd844ac856d47aa6a5b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1egzozd/i_designed_a_little_protocol_for_reducing_the/

6930,Need help on Strong Mathematical Induction,"Hello, I am a Computer Science student learning discrete mathematics, and I find the strong mathematical induction a little bit counter intuitive. I am not sure if I really understand the topic (which is an important elementary technique). I will try to present what I understand in a concise way, and it will be appreciated if you can verify if my understanding is correct or pointing out if there is anything wrong.

Let's use an example question.

Problem: *Every positive integer* n ≥ 2 *can be written as the product of primes.*

Solution outline: (1: Initial Step) Prove P(2) is true; (2: Inductive Step) Prove that P(2) ∧ P(3)...P(k) ⇒ P(k + 1) is true, where k is a single arbitrary N.

Here comes the essense of my question, I decided to breakdown the solution by dry-running it (get a feel of the underlying logic of strong induction), and you may need to focus on this part (appreciated!)

1. P(2) is true (base case)
2. For k = 2: P(2) is true ⇒ P(3) is true. Since P(2) is true (proven), P(3) is true.
3. For k = 3: P(2) and P(3) is true ⇒ P(4) is true. Since P(2) and P(3) is true (proven), P(4) is true.
4. For k = 4: P(2), P(3) and P(4) is true ⇒ P(5) is true. Since P(2), P(3) and P(4) is true, P(5) is true.

6941,"Starting my Masters in a few weeks, worried I know nothing","Hi all, I'm looking for some advice & resources to use to help me gain some background knowledge before starting my masters in Software Engineering.

So this is going to sound kind of insane... but over a year ago I graduated with a bachelors in Biology. I worked in a lab for a year before deciding I didn't want to work in a lab and commute for the rest of my life. My brother is a software engineer and was talking to me about Computational Biology which piqued my interest. I had taken a bioinformatics course in undergrad and really enjoyed it, so I decided to go back to school. He had worked with computational biologists before and told me that they found themselves in a similar situation as myself, ungrad in bio, hated working in the lab, so they returned to school to pursue a masters in Comp Sci and became Computational Biologists.

In the spring I enrolled in a few intro Comp Sci classes a local community college. The classes were very foundational. I took one class on logic and design which just basically went through the mindset of a programmer, loops, arrays, etc and I worked a bit in Python. The other class was a Java class which basically covered the same things except I was working in Java-- which I found helpful to understand OOP. And then finally I took discrete math which is a prereq for the masters I was applying to, and learned a bit on algorithms and other stuff.  I enjoyed my programming classes so decided I would probably just do software engineering for my masters.

After the spring semester, I applied for my masters (to start in the fall). I was expected to receive conditional enrollment (as I had only completed one of the prereqs for non-comp sci degree holders). I was intending that they would let me in and accept me as long as I finished the other prereqs (one was Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms, the other was an assembly language class). But they accepted my and told me I didn't need to complete any prerequisites, in fact they advised against doing any prereqs if they were not required for me.

Now heres the issue, I feel like I know absolutely diddly squat aside from a little bit of coding and a bit of algorithms. I am really worried I am not prepared for my classes which start in just 3 weeks. I was hoping the prereqs would have given me the knowledge I needed to feel more confident but I was advised against taking them. I am really worried because I also kind of feel unworthy for my acceptance. I know I have good study ethic and can work hard, but I know a lot of my peers are going to have undergrad degrees in Comp Sci & most likely industry experience & I feel my knowledge is severely lacking. And if there are group projects involved I want to be able to meaningfully contribute, not be a bumbling idiot with no knowledge.

Here are the classes I am taking in 3 weeks along w/ the descriptions-- they are 3 credits each. If anyone can guide me to where I can study and prepare for this / familiarize myself with some of these topics I would be greatly appreciative. I am so anxious and really don't want to sit in class and have no idea what is going on. Thank you all in advance!

Unlike GPTs and other flashcard study tools, we organize the cards to be more structured and we provide a focus mode to facilitate the memorization task so users do not need extra work on planning. In the future, we will integrate a lot more features for example lecture videos, notes, mind maps, for a more comprehensive learning experience.

6963,Do all quantum hardware systems use the same model of computation?,"Hello, I’m a second year comp sci student and have become fixated on the idea of incompatibility of quantum information and classical measurements/ boo lean logic based hardware in quantum computing systems.

Mathematics isn’t my thing, but the idea of different models of logic and computation being fundamentally incompatible interests me to some degree.

I plan on *maybe* looking at emergence in quantum logic defined dynamic systems and boo lean systems to possibly see if there is anything interesting conclusions to draw about how information is measured in such systems.

I’m not even sure if this is worth exploring, as brain stuff/ cognition is where my expertise lays. I am just doing comp sci before I pursue a neuro degree to get some fundamental applied mathematics and learn programming and data structures.

I became fascinated by this several months ago and started learning quantum information and teaching myself qiskit.

Could someone with a more formal background help me out here?

7004,Research Paper - ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination of Internet-scale Systems,"I'm reading paper mentioned in title. In section 2.3 ZooKeeper Guarantees, authors have detailed how below scenario is handled. I am having hard time understanding their reasoning.

[ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/atc10/tech/full_papers/Hunt.pdf)

Assume a scenario where master node needs to update configurations in zookeeper. For this the master node need to remove 'ready' znode. Any worker node verifies the presence of 'ready' znode before reading any configuration. When a new master node needs to update configuration, it deletes the 'ready' znode and then updates the configuration and add 'ready' znode back again. With the technique, no worker server will read the configuration while it is being updated.

My doubt is how is scenario handled in which a worker node reads the 'ready' znode, starts reading the configuration. While worker node is reading the configuration, the master node, in order to update configuration, delete 'ready' znode and starts updating the configuration. Now we are in the scenario where the configurations are being updated while a worker node is reading the configuration",1722760430,397232,goyalaman_,t2_5aahsqhl,21d56685393186ff7473671d7efadda1411fbfe755629781f2799b3eae2a41da,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ejqj6b/research_paper_zookeeper_waitfree_coordination_of/

7006,Research Experience ,"I am looking to transfer to research part time and I don't know how.

I (21M) have been employed for a year now. My job is great, I am on an accelerated learning path, and overall my position withing my team is great.   
However, I have always planned to pursue a  master's degree. My initial plan was to work for 4-5 years and then start looking into master's programs, however due several factors I am looking to start earlier. The scenario I have in mind is applying for 2025 grad programs (aka I still have a year of planning) This I believe gives me the best shot where I would have 2 years of experience in development and give me sometime to polish my researching skills which are non existent as I write. (If you think this is a bad plan please feel free to comment)

So the purpose of my post  is to ask how to gain some research experience on a part time basis until next year. I have noticed that most masters programs have the majority of the funding/scholarship aid in programs that focus on research. So I want to be prepared with some research experience that it could give me some edge or advantage on getting accepted and securing some sort of funding.

I am thinking of contacting my university professors whom I had decent relation with in case I can join aby of their researches as a part time RA. I am also looking for some online fellowship programs research webinars or any research firm that would accept me as a part time employee or volunteer. All this have resulted in 0 acceptances so far. so where should i focus more ?

I really want to start doing more with electronics and hands on stuff. I really want to break into embedded programming and get my hands on experience.

I like that the arduino is a simplified version of C++, but I want to get better at programming and have projects I can work on to do that. I can do the same with the pi, but even more.

I like that the pi is a computer, and I can do more than just basic C++.

Anything helps.",1722829919,397359,SwigOfRavioli349,t2_101g4kfk8b,e0e898c0408bfa217758bed4f66b1f3c3bfedef992d257f921e11e1d2a7c0a4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ekecbq/raspberry_pi_or_arduino_for_hands_on_electronic/

7019,Help Suggest a Laptop for CSE and CyberSecurity ,"\* Total budget (In local currency) and country of purchase: 

1,25,000 rupees / 1500 USD 

India

\* Are you open to refurbs/used?

 No 

\* How would you prioritize form factor, build quality, performance, and battery life?

Performance> Battery life> Build quality 

\* Do you have a preferred screen size? 

Preferably 15.6 or MORE, bigger screen is better for me

\* Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 

VMware/Virtual Machines , Python , C++, C , Java , mostly these. 

\* If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 

 I don’t really mind about gaming as I would like to use this mainly for  uni (programming , cybersecurity and other CSE projects)

\* Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? 

touch screen is optional if other specs are good too. Preferably want a number pad(on keyboard)

want sustaining battery life with lesser heat generation and maybe white or light coloured laptop 



\*  any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

i will want 32gb ram mostly , so feel free to suggest 16gb laptops that are upgradeable to 32gb as well 

minimum 1tb storage for now 

longer battery life from 80-20% 

big screen is prefer so no 14 inches 

i7 level range minimum 

i will need to run virtual machines so will require more cores 

dont need high end dgpu

I've just wrapped up a project that I believe could really help us students, or at least ease a common struggle we all face: organizing our notes.

This app is designed to keep all your notes in one place with simple and straightforward subdivisions.

I understand there are plenty of advanced productivity tools available, but I've often found them to be more than what I need for just organizing notes. They can feel a bit overwhelming. So, I aimed for something simpler that just gets the job done.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. If you're interested in giving it a try, I can publish it on the Play Store and would greatly appreciate any feedback you have.

What I mean is if you give me a programming assignment with a specific problem I'll be able to solve it if it's in my domain. But when I see the whole code of an actual project/program it feels yes I understand it and i can do it bit by bit if you keep telling me like , let's now create a class to store this and have these properties. But on its own it feels very difficult

7089,What are some CS and math topics that you applied at your job?,"I would be interested in hearing from you about the CS and math topics that you applied at your job  *outside* of interviews. Which of those topics did you need to actually understand instead of seeing them like a black box?  What knowledge did you expect to become useful but the topic never materialized? I realize that this depends on the type of technology that you are dealing with, I want to see different perspectives.


The most useful for me personally were:

Tree structures. Parsing and modifying them. Most common because of configuration languages and programming languages being structured like that.

Hand written parsers

Linear optimisation

Probability theory. A business wanted to predict the need to expand infrastructure . I realized that the prediction of an average  of 10% of sites needing infrastructure expansion in the future does not make for a good business case, because it means 90% of  expansions are not needed and do not generate extra income. Instead the business needs to identify the events that predict future sales at a site that require infrastructure expansion to be made and raise that % up far enough for a good business case.


Topics where a black box understanding was good enough:

Boolean algebra simplifier

set operations, and how SQL resolves a query

Search algorithms


Topics that were less useful than expected:

Dynamic systems and control theory

Differential and integral calculus 

Irrational numbers

Queuing theory. In practice, the benchmark counts.

7095,HELP needed with An associative entity with its own primary key,"I'm making an attendance system which has users who can participate in a lot of activities. So, many students will be able to participate in many activities, but each entity have their own ID as primary keys. In order for me to be able to check every single participation by every user, I've created another table called participation with idpenyertaan as its primary key(in another language).  The table has 4 attributes which are idpenyertaan, idpeserta (ID of the participant), idactivity (ID of the activity signed up by the participant) and status (absent or present). So, if a user participates in an activity, a new entry will be created in the participation table where the idpenyertaan will automatically be generated, the ID of the activity, ID of the participant will be inserted. With this said, I'm currently making an ERD and a relational scheme, but I do not know how to deal with this part. I thought of making the participant table as the associative entity for the activity and the participants but I will need to add idpenyertaan as another primary key and a normal attribute for status. I think this is wrong because, from what I've learnt, an associative array purely primary keys from the entities its connected to.

7131,Enrolled in a Computer Vision PhD but feeling lost - help me find what I'd really like to do (later?),"Hi everyone! I'm 27 years old and hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science. The final part of my undergrad and my M.Sc. were focused on Computer Vision and AI/ML. This was a conscious decision, although perhaps not for the best reasons: I always felt indecisive about picking an area of focus, I was simultaneously interested in many things to some degree, yet never felt like I had a ""singular"" passion, and as such I oriented myself based on which professors appeared nicer/more helpful, as well as what seemed to be ""trendy"" in Computer Science.

In September it'll be three years since I started a PhD in CV as well, again haunted by some uncertainty but partially feeling like I'd invested too much knowledge-wise to not continue. However, by now I can say with a fair amount of confidence that I do not enjoy the field. Some of the reasons include excessive congestion in the area with tons of papers of very little novelty coming out every week, the ""black box"" facet of Deep Learning research where success largely boils down to throwing a billion things at the wall and seeing what sticks, the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees and the extreme amount of hype that AI has created in society, especially in the last two years. In addition, I often find myself thinking that I just can't bring myself to care about most of the ""problems"" we deal with in the area. Fancy image generation looks cool and impressive but I can't imagine society actually benefiting from it, I don't really care about self-driving cars or surveillance too much and many problems appear to me either solved or ""made up""/inconsequential.

Speaking of things that *I do* actually enjoy, I really like studying proof-based, rigorous mathematics, and I still like coding and designing software architectures a lot, but the project has to be of interest to me. I can easily see myself working on a game engine, a renderer, compilers, embedded systems etc. Despite that, I often feel that all of the interesting things have already been done and that the jobs that are out there are much more boring, such that projects of the sort that I described could only ever happen as personal projects (""who would need a renderer in 2024?"").

I guess I'm writing this post to see whether what I write here resonates with any of you, and whether you have any advice for me. I've often thought about quitting the PhD altogether, and still am, but right now due to the recent and sudden end of a long relationship I'm going through a turbulent time and I don't want to make hasty decisions. At the same time, it feels like after the effort I've invested it would perhaps make sense to try to see it through for the qualification/title.

7140,Confusion regarding 2's compliment and operations,"So we had a question for one of the tests where we had to evaluate the answer up to 4 bits of the following question using binary operations:

(-6)-(-4)

Here I calculated 2's complement for -6 which is 1010. Ideally we would require 2's complement of 2's complement of -4 and add the binary number to the 2's complement of -6 to arrive at the answer  


Since 2's complement of 2's complement gives the same number, it technically should become-

\-6+4

which should give 1110 as the right answer, it being 2's complement of -2. Now the question did not have this answer as an option. Instead, the professor argued that the correct answer was 0110 since subtraction has no hardware implementation and that it treats the expression as   


(-6)+(-4) 

1010 + 1100 = 0110 , 0110 being the 2's complement of -10.

This has sparked an confusion within the class whether whose right. My head has been wrapping around this for a while since class. So what should be the correct answer ? 1110 or 0110

A transistor can take in inputs and act like an on-off switch. It has no idea what addition is. A CPU knows how to add two numbers but is clueless about what taking in inputs from a user means.  
  
This is similar to a car. Where a car can move forward or turn with paddles and steering, the engine that drives the car only knows to take in air and fuel and burn it to create kinetic energy, It has no idea what forward motion of a car is.  
  
Abstractions make life and computers possible. You can drive a car forward without knowing how energy is harnessed from combustion. You can instruct a program on adding numbers without needing to understand transistors or how bits move around in memory. Such is the power of abstractions.

7168,Introducing PUFAnalytics: A Comprehensive Python Library for Analyzing Physically Unclonable Functions,"I'm thrilled to introduce PUFAnalytics, an open-source Python library for comprehensive evaluation and analysis of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). If you're working on hardware security, this tool is a must-have in your arsenal! 🔒🔬

What are PUFs, you ask? They are innovative hardware security primitives that leverage intrinsic variations in integrated circuits to generate unique ""fingerprints"". PUFs enable exciting applications like device authentication, key generation, and anti-counterfeiting. 🎉


🌟 Key Features of PUFAnalytics:

Calculate critical PUF metrics including Intra-PUF Variation, Inter-PUF Variation, Uniqueness, Reliability, Avalanche Effect, and Uniformity

Assess the performance, security, and robustness of PUF instances under varying conditions

Ideal for academic research or developing secure hardware


📈 PUFAnalytics provides implementations for a wide range of essential PUF metrics:

Intra-PUF Variation: Measures the variation in the same PUF's response under different conditions

Inter-PUF Variation: Measures the difference between different PUF instances' responses

Uniqueness: Determines how distinct responses are across different PUF instances

Reliability: Evaluates the consistency of a PUF's response under varied conditions

Avalanche Effect: Assesses the sensitivity of the PUF to changes in input challenges

Uniformity: Measures the balance of 1s and 0s in a single PUF response


🧮 The repository also includes detailed explanations and formulas for calculating each PUF metric, making it a valuable resource for understanding the underlying concepts.

🚀 Getting started with PUFAnalytics is a breeze:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TakMashhido/PUFAnalytics.git

Navigate to the directory: cd PUFAnalytics

Install the library: pip install .

👨‍💻👩‍💻 Check out the example file to see PUFAnalytics in action with sample data and learn how to use the library functions.


🌟 PUFAnalytics is open-source and available now on GitHub: https://github.com/TakMashhido/PUFAnalytics

⭐ Give it a star, try it out, and let me know what you think! I'm excited to collaborate with the community to make PUFAnalytics even better. Happy analyzing! 😄",1723224670,398327,ElitistScientist,t2_5gvmcsg1s,6cffa4cc196a422ed02fb743e6f2c0213d5db5e8cf2f04218230ac71b488c0e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1eo5r6t/introducing_pufanalytics_a_comprehensive_python/

I am in mid 40s and curious to learn about coding. Currently debating career transition to accounting but open minded.

Back in 2006 I refuse to learn anything of computer because I am old(I was only 23 but after coming back from 3 tours of war, I has very narrow mind set).

Now, I want to help myself grow. Truth is I do not know much of program and coding but I read many places that it is valuable skills in many profession.

My local college provides   
  
1.Visual C# .NET programming language  
2. JAVA  
3. Phyton  
4. SQL

I was told that Phyton is the easiest to learn but some says its good to have basic coding on JAVA first.

May I ask which sequence should I study? also is it wise to take 2 different language at the same time.

But here’s the thing—I know how tough it is to build something from the ground up without a team. That’s why I’m reaching out to connect with like-minded people who share the same entrepreneurial spirit and passion for creating something awesome. Whether you’ve got a cool idea brewing or are just as eager as I am to start building something new, let’s connect!

Let’s brainstorm, share ideas, and start building brick by brick. I believe that together, we can create something truly impactful. Looking forward to hearing from anyone interested in this exciting journey!

Assuming a 'high-quality' hash means a hash generated by a trusted algorithm with a low probability of collision in a hash table.

The order of the values doesn't matter, in fact I want to use the sum like this so arrays with identical elements hash to the same value.

There are some problems obvious at low values, for example, [7, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 7] would hash to the same value, but so would [6, 3, 4, 1]. In practice these values are 64-bit hashes, so the question is if this problem is significant enough to cause problems with collision with arbitrarily large numbers.",1723302245,398540,RylanStylin57,t2_5gn5k003,2fe91aafd2ce6b95d49f6ffcdf000e35014df8273ecffd5038ca15657aa40460,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1eov5po/sum_of_hashes_question/

The only method I found is ok if you have small number of addresses.
But what do I do when I need to check 512 addresses?
There has to be some formula/way to get approximately the number of miss calls.

Hope someone can help me.

Here’s an example for Exam Question:

Main memory=128 Kbytes
Cache memory= 256 bytes
Block size= 16 bytes
Cache Structure: 2-way set associative
Cache policy: FIFO

The CPU reads data in successive addresses from address 0 to address 511 in ascending order (addresses in decimal) and again from address 511 to address 0 in descending order.
total 1024 readings in memory.

whats the total number of miss calls?
a) 40-49
b) 20-29
c) 0-19
d) 50-100
e) 100+

7243,I USED AI TO AUTOMATICALLY APPLY FOR 1000 JOBS - AND I GOT 50 INTERVIEWS!,"
# How Did I Do It?

I created an AI bot that:

* Analyzes candidate information
* Examines job descriptions
* Generates unique CVs and cover letters for each job
* Answers specific questions that recruiters ask
* Automatically applies to jobs

And all of this while I was sleeping! In just one month, this method helped me secure around 50 interviews. The tailored CVs and cover letters, customized based on each job description, made a significant difference.

# AI is Changing the Game

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the recruiting landscape:

* Job seekers can optimize their CVs in seconds
* Cover letters are crafted with a click
* Perfect matching between skills and job offers
* Recruiters are using automated screening systems

This method is incredibly effective at passing through automated screening systems. By generating CVs and cover letters tailored to each job description, my script significantly increases the chances of getting noticed by both AI and human recruiters.

# Questions for the Future

* Will human recruiters become obsolete?
* How will we distinguish real talent in a sea of seemingly perfect applications?
* Are we entering an ""AI arms race"" in recruiting?

# Soft Skills: The New Differentiator?

In a world of AI-optimized applications:

* Empathy
* Creativity
* Critical thinking

Could become the real distinguishing factors.

# Personal Reflection

Observing this technological revolution, I can't help but reflect on the profound implications for the world of work. While efficient, the automation of job applications is becoming increasingly dominant, raising questions about the very nature of professional relationships. Today, recruiters rely more and more on automated screening tools, risking the loss of the human element that often makes a difference in the workplace. 
**However, with the growing use of AI by candidates as well, recruiters may now have to return to conducting interviews personally, instead of relying on stupid automated screenings. **
The challenge ahead is not just technological, but also ethical and social. We’ll need to find a delicate balance between the efficiency of artificial intelligence and the richness of human interactions. Only then can we build a future of work that is not just productive, but also fulfilling and meaningful for everyone.

# Want to Try This Magic?

Here's what it does:

* Enter your professional background
* It generates tailored CVs, cover letters, and responses
* Sends hundreds of applications while you enjoy a coffee

Curious? Try it here: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/feder-cr/linkedIn_auto_jobs_applier_with_AI)

(My project is completely free and open source, unlike other similar services that cost a lot and offer very little value. Since it’s still in beta, every star on GitHub is a huge encouragement to keep developing it!)

**P.S.** I do not recommend using this bot , it was created for educational d information purposes only, with great power of AI comes great responsibility. Let's use it ethically!

I apologize if this isn't the correct sub for this, but I couldn't think of a better one where people could differentiate these two programs.

As of now, my two choices are Morgan's BS in Cloud Computing (in-person/online) and then UMGC (Online). These two programs entice me because they both allow me to study while going to work at the same time. 

Right now, I am leaning in Morgan's direction because they have the option to do in-person classes, which could serve well for networking.

7256,What is QLoRA?: A Visual Guide to Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs,"TL;DR: QLoRA is Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (**PEFT**) method. It makes LoRA (which we covered in a previous post) more efficient thanks to the NormalFloat4 (NF4) format introduced in QLoRA.

**Using the NF4 4-bit format for quantization with QLoRA outperforms standard 16-bit finetuning as well as 16-bit LoRA.**

The article covers details that makes QLoRA efficient and as performant as 16-bit models while using only 4-bit floating point representations thanks to optimal normal distribution quantization, block-wise quantization and paged optimzers.

This makes it cost, time, data, and GPU efficient without losing performance.

Hey everyone,



I’ve been a Java dev for 4 years now, mostly working with various frameworks. But lately, I’m realizing I’ve kinda lost touch with the fundamentals—like what’s really happening under the hood.



I want to get back to basics and focus on stuff like:



1. \*\*Java Internals:\*\* Understanding how the JVM works, garbage collection, etc.

2. \*\*Memory Management:\*\* How Java handles memory, stack vs heap, optimizing memory use.

3. \*\*Efficiency:\*\* Writing faster, more efficient code, and digging into algorithms.



Anyone else been here? How’d you go about relearning this stuff? Any resources or tips?

Basically, the principle was you had 2 computers on either the same network or over the old TCP/IP connection. Before these 2 machines could send a msg to each other like a chat message, both machines had to swap keys, keys these computers would use to encrypt that message or data to send back over the connection to decrypt, but the kicker however, was that to intercept these messages would be wasteful as only the 2 computers between both ends could encrypt, decrypt, interpet and send these messages so long astge machines had these keys to work from.

I am having an issue trying to remember what it's called and it's eating the inside of mind trying to remember it while Google gives me no help researching it as their Gemini leads me to dead ends and facts about cows migrating north to refridgerate their own milk before being milked.

Does anyone remember what this was called?",1723660844,399258,Tassachar,t2_175201,4ec63f7f918130fa7e58741bd235743e4ae1e7dd1465f2170a8d775d8a4ae1a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1es9dxi/what_was_this_classic_encryption/

7307,Settle an Argument for Me,"Settle an Argument for me

Superfluous context: I was not involved in this discussion and have no real stake, nor am I a developer/coder, but have some crossover with CS in my field so was listening out of curiosity.

So I was on discord and a CS PhD was talking about some of his experiences in the job market, his thesis in school, and his interests. A software developer joined the channel and accused him of lying and being a “fake dev”. The software developer’s litmus test for proving this was asking the CS PhD “how do you fix a reference cycle”. I’m paraphrasing here, but the CS PhD more or less said “It’s context dependent and that’s kind of a loaded question, a reference cycle may be intentional and not need fixing”. The software developer said this proved the CS PhD didn’t know what he was talking about and that reference cycles always result in memory leaks and he was stupid.

I don’t have the background knowledge to really understand this argument. Who was right?",1723684937,399272,Abject-Lab7837,t2_6kv70rb1,0d6589381675d6fa86eab53b5d6a5fb24e4485a16f1297cc1e02e67df77b79c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1esikug/settle_an_argument_for_me/
7308,What exactly is Computer Science?,"After 3 years of studying Computer Science I still don't know what it is. Is it a pure Maths degree because of theoretical Computer Science? Is it an electrical engineering degree because of Computer Engineering? Is it an economics degree because of software engineering? Is it a programming degree? It just feels so random.

Maybe I need to do some internships to find out what exactly you do with a Computer Science degree. But for some reason I find it difficult to see where the above can be applied. It feels like I am studying something, but I don't know exactly what it is, even after 3 years. Maybe it's more of a personal problem than a real problem. Probably. But regardless I am uncertain what I am actually studying for",1723687985,399276,afreshstart10112,t2_16iogpkkyp,c287e95f81151ddb04a6d6aa81745a926a862cc3c21851bf7156e91010e08649,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1esjnhr/what_exactly_is_computer_science/

It is a bunch of full adders chained together, to making a ripple-carry adder which takes the outputs of the previous full adder and adds them together with the next bit of the number.  
I feel like this doesn't make much sense though, why not somehow reuse the same full adder again and again until all the bits are added up, feeding the c-out back into the c-in, and putting the next a and b into the same full adder.  
Is this just not possible to do with the way electricity works or is there some way to actually do this that I didn't know of?",1723689546,399281,Alternative_Try8009,t2_gr83wf6p,e831c1b434d068e0d10a1df1b6c8a54689e8fd0df63c0de0ca35753365cd9a41,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1esk7ga/reusing_full_adders_in_ripplecarry_adders/

But our brain is just a bunch of neurons processing information. Couldn't that ""hardware"" or that way of processing information be reproduced by a computer?

So I am planning for master next year, the reason being not because I like some CS field that I want to explore in. But because I’m bored out of my mind at my job and want to go back to school to learn and expand my knowledge and enjoy learning.

But the problem is I just don’t want to go for it without exploring all the options. And I’m tired of searching on web, mostly it will show me same things that I’m already aware of.. ml/ai , cloud, security etc.

I want someone to share their experience with me on why they loved that major.. maybe I can get some inspiration from it and it will be take my stress away?

7357,My first 2 days as a SWE - I feel DEVASTATED ,"Nothing in this life has prepared me for this, not university, nor any courses.
I feel deep imposter syndrome, devastated, unqualified and like a failure. 
I don't know what to do and how did I pass the 3 interviews. How I am here. The tech stack now is quite different than the one asked in the interview and job description. 
At some point someone will realize that I don't know how to code (I do but this stuff here is SO different). I feel like I will dissapoint everyone and give up. 
I am moving too slow. I feel like I got not that much training (quite literally not at all, and I've had no internships before) and I am now forced into the ocean to swim and survive. Everyone seems so absorbed in their stuff and know what they're doing.
I need and I feel like I have to learn so much (I want to) but when should I do that if I have to keep moving forward with the job tasks and accomplish them (even though I don't know how to do that well). Even if I work 7/7 and at home to learn, understand and be better at the job, I still have such limited time and energy and I'm already so tired after 2 days.

I want to do well but I don't know how and when. I just feel so devastated. How did I manage to end up here?

I don't know what to do. Please help me. I will deeply appreciate any of your advice


P.S. why is the actual job SO different from what is asked in interviews and taught in university? Like how am I supposed to know how to do all of this, and also do it FAST and PRODUCTIVELY.

7379, Lost After Finishing My CS Degree—Struggling to Find Direction and a Job,"Hey Reddit,

I'm feeling pretty lost and could really use some guidance. I just finished my computer science degree, but I’m struggling with what to do next. I have interests in UX/UI, cybersecurity, and data analysis, but my course barely touched on any of these areas. It feels like I’ve forgotten so much, and I’m not sure how to specialize or choose what to focus on (feels like I’m not very invested in anything).

On top of that, the job hunt has been brutal. I’ve applied to over 1,000 jobs and only managed to get 11 interviews. I feel like I nail the interviews, but then I get rejected for vague reasons, or they ask for things like Amazon AWS experience, which I haven’t touched.

I’ve done quite a few personal projects—nothing too crazy, but I did build a TSP solver in React, which was probably the hardest. Even so, I feel stuck and unsure of how to improve.

How do I figure out what to focus on? Any advice on how to break out of this box and actually land a job? Whats a good roadmap to take to improve after university????

7387,How rare is it to make a paradigm shift in CS? and how does one achieve it?,"I hope I don't get downvoted for senseless questions.

I've always been interested in Turing awards since a kid. I was however more interested in the existence of fields in CS, machine learning didn't pop up for a long time until recently in the 90s. I trust there are so many more fields yet to be innovated and that's something I always liked about CS that since its man-made it quite literally has no limits and no one knows what's going to be next because the capacity of a computer is endless and so are innovations based on it.

My question really is how does one go about research in computer science? I don't mean invention of algorithms or patents which no one really looks into but like new fields. How does one foster this mindset, how does one learn to research? 

If it were to be a research in physics or biology we clearly know what we want to find so we set up experiments to figure shit out ( or u just find new shit randomly lmao ). But in CS?? its not like that or I think so at least.

7398,Suggestions for major choice for Master in information technology ( extension),"Hey everyone!

my\_qualifications: B.E CSE grad from India with about 7 months of internship experience and 1.3 years working full-time as a full stack developer (mostly .NET and Angular). I'm planning to join UTS for Master of Information Technology (Extension). But I'm having a hard time choosing my major choice.  
Coding has been great, but I’m starting to realize that it’s not really my thing. I’m more interested in roles that involve managing people and dealing with human-related aspects.

So, I’m looking majors that might align better with my interests while still setting me up for a good-paying job to help clear my student loans. These are the major choice:

* Cyber Security
* Business Information Systems
* Data Analytics
* Enterprise Software Development
* Interactive Media
* Internetworking

What do you all think would be the best fit considering my background and goals? I don't want my diploma and experience to become null.

This happens quite often in menu where I can see my loot and most of the time in raid within buildings and near loot. The only place I can control my mouse/aiming normally is at the corner of the map next to trees and bushes.

This is like having drunk sluggish inertia for the mouse controls.

My GTX 3060 stays at constant 99% and my I7-9700 at around 20% whenever this problem occurs. And it occurs most of the times and this is too frequent to enjoy the game at all.

I tried these tips but with no solution at all:  
Mouse polling rate from 1000hz to 500hz.  
GPU drivers updated.  
All in-game setting combinations.  
FPS limited to 61 in raid and to 21 in menu.

7466,Proof of P ≠ NP (updated),"The proof sketch is to show that there is no deterministic Turing Machine that can answer the question ""Does this input correspond to an algorithm that can compute irrationals?"".

For any monotone increasing sets of certain irrationals, at any specific element $i$ in the sequence, there is a common representation (""programming language""), or parametrization, that can encode all of these irrationals up to $i$.

If $\\mathtt{P} = \\mathtt{NP}$, then that would imply the existence of a common representation of all irrationals. But such a representation cannot exist.

7472,"What are some of the best ""theoretical"" books on programming to accelerate my learning process?","I'm a Sociology graduate with a very strong interest in international-relations and macro-economics...... I genuinely find my joy in finding over-lapping interactions between advanced systems.

While lots of people learn stuff practically first, I find myself struggling and entirely uninterested. But if I approach something by reducing it to ""first-principles"", I tend to absolutely snowball and learn the practical stuff very quickly..... because I'm good at mapping out the axioms at which logic plays out in my mind.

So I've picked up ""Code"" by Petzold. I'm ultimately trying to get into Cyber, and my end goals are to ultimately build tools that utilize machine-learning to reverse engineer. And this feels like the right choice.

The issue with ""code"", is that it finally gets past the binary, buses, and CPUs...... to higher level languages at page 425....... 

It's a great foundation for understanding the underlying processes that programming attempts to simplify....... But I'd like to read one more book before I really jump into practical's.......... that gives languages like ASM, Python, C and Java, along with algorithms, the same treatment. 

What is the ""one"" book that I should pick up? 

Thank you so much!!

7477,Let me revolutionise binary!,"/!\ DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE /!\

I got this idea this morning:
Code is binary, so it’s a long list of 1’s and 0’s and to stock these you need a drive that has a limit. **But we can upgrade this limit a lot!!**

We can use other numbers/letters to translate binary code.

For example: 00 becomes a; 01 becomes b; 10 becomes c and 11 becomes d

**10110010 is now CDAC**. We went from a 8-digit code to a 4-digit code.

But we can go further. There’s a lot of letters in the alphabet (+ their cap version). We can translate not a 2, not 3 but 4-digit sequence!!

0000 - A
0001 - B
0010 - C
0011 - D
0100 - E
0101 - F
0110 - G
0111 - H
1000 - I
1001 - J
1010 - K
1011 - L
1100 - M
1101 - N
1110 - O
1111 - P

Thus,
**1100 1010 0111 0001 1010 1100**
becomes
**MKHBKM**

We went from 24 digits to 6. A 1To Drive would now be able to contain 6To out of data.


I know this is impossible and there are a lot of issues so please explain why it wouldn’t work because as I said, I know nothing about computer science!!

7486,Confused About This Example In The Big O Wiki,"I read the formal definition of Big O notation, and I understand what it is. I'm just confused about the example in the wiki page for it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation

In the example, it is specified that the running time of a certain algorithm is 6x^2 - 2x^3 + 5 and that this is the big O of x^4. 

What I'm not understanding is this. Big O notation is used to show the worst case scenario for an algorithms run time as the data input gets larger. If we have a polynomial for the algorithm already, why bother with Big O? 

Another thing I didn't get is if we are supposed to try to approximate a function that upper bounds the previously mentioned polynomial, why do we use a C that isn't 1? 


What I mean is x^4 upper bounds 6x^2 - 2x^3 + 5 only if x^4 is multiplied by a large enough constant C, but we don't actually use C * x^4. Isn't using C * x^4 better since it provides an upper bound for 6x^2 - 2x^3 + 5?",1724352489,400881,Basic-Definition8870,t2_umkuvjxot,b40ba61866894dc0781d12695169dfa18fed719344f202c4f5d0fbbb3ddc53f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1eyr92x/confused_about_this_example_in_the_big_o_wiki/

7516,Discovered I'm Good at Solving Steiner Tree Problems – Is There Any Demand for This? Offering Free Help Initially,"Hey everyone,

So, I'm a civil engineering student and recently realized that I'm pretty good at solving Steiner tree problems. For those who aren't familiar, it's a type of optimization problem where you try to connect a set of points with the shortest possible network. I know there are already some algorithms out there to tackle this, but I've found that I have a knack for it and can often find efficient solutions.

The thing is, I'm not sure if there's any real demand for this kind of service. I would love to offer my help to anyone who might need it – whether it's in telecom, logistics, circuit design, or any other field where these problems come up. To build up some experience and references, I'm happy to offer this service for free at first.

Is this something people might need help with? And if so, where would I find those who could use this kind of assistance?

Thanks for any advice!

7563,Enumerating solution vs. ILP solver,"Hello everyone,

currently in my research i have a few problems where im looking for a tree / forest with certain properties.  
In my working group it is very common to just use ILP solver like gurobi. However, from a theoretical point of view ILP branch and bound methods have O(2\^(m)) (m number of variables; in my case number of edges) worst-case runtime. It seems much more plausibel to me to just enumerate all trees in O(binom(m,n-1)\*poly(m)).

  
I already implemented ILP based methods to solve some of my problem but they are inpractically slow.

My next idea would be to try out an enumeration based apporach but it seems odd to me that this is not the standard approach in such cases. Do you have any experience with enumeration algorithms in practice? Is it worth a shot? Im trying to coordinate my time, if many people have bad experiences with these kind of approaches, I would consider focusing my time on other things.",1724613493,401332,Kartoffelnokyojin,t2_c2gxfezp,cd456052afcceb10293937ab6e824e886bf3e8ba2b341654077e68c30035a8e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f14ea6/enumerating_solution_vs_ilp_solver/

7582,"Are there any practical decision problems in higher complexity (as in P, NP, EXP, NEXP, etc.) classes? Are there complexity classes characterized by fast growing functions like uncomputable functions?","So we know lots of practical problems in P, NP, EXP, and NEXP. I.e., we have languages where either the solver or verifier has a(n upper bound) runtime or space usage characterized by logarithms, by polynomials, by exponential functions, even by the Ackermann function, and one algorithm whose amortized time complexity is characterized by the inverse Ackermann function.

But are there any examples of (either contrived, or preferably practical) decision problems where either the solver or the verifier has a time or memory complexity of a more exotic function? And is still below R or RE, so it *can* be solved or *can* be verified in finite time / space.

For example, a fast-growing, uncomputable function, like the busy beaver function? What would a decision problem capable of being solved or verified in runtime / space complexity of big O of BB(n) look like? Or more precisely, big theta of BB(n)?

In other words, is there a practical decision problem that can only solved in:

- Θ(BB(n)) time (it's not also contained in P, EXP, etc.)
- Θ(BB(n)) space (it's not also contained in PSPACE, EXPSPACE)

Or whose solutions can only be verified in:

- Θ(BB(n)) time (it's not also contained in NP, NEXP, etc.)

7610,cracks in the halting problem,"hey all!

i've been thinking about the halting problem for some years now, and i'd like to talk about ideas i've been working on in regards to it not being as meaningful as it is near universally taken to be.

there's a variety of lines of thoughts i've developed on this, but i'm going to start with some initial observations that didn't make sense to me all those years ago, and if there's enough interest i will post further thoughts on the matter.

let me be upfront about a few things: i'm not gunna talk about my motivations just yet. i don't really want to talk about the fact i'm questioning nearly a century of computability theory built on top of *the* paper in which computing itself was invented. many people are going to react to this as if i'm asking whether 1 plus 1 actually equals 2... and i'm aware of this. i'm also not able to connect this theory to related domains, i'm focused into the perspective of halting analysis on finite state machines, of sufficient complexity. how this is related to the wider body of math is certainly a conversation i do want to have in the future, but none of us are there yet, my friends.

______________

let us start with a distilled version of the halting oracle disproof and the paradox presented to do so. there are more complex ways to put this, but ultimately they don’t add much proving power, and possibly just confound the issue. 

first, we can create a basic functional mapping that defines a halting oracle:

    halts (ƒ: function) -> {
      1: function ƒ halts
      0: otherwise
    }

the oracle takes function definition ƒ and maps it to 1 if ƒ halts, or 0 if ƒ does not, and essentially can put ƒ in either the set of functions that halt, or the set of functions that do not halt. ideally, all functions should be able to be categorized to one of these sets, as the quality of a function that halts is precisely opposite of one that does not, and there isn't any gradient in between: this quality can be reduced to a binary matter.

normally this oracle definition, including that in Turing's paper, includes some input *I* to function ƒ as well, but it honestly doesn't matter. any function ƒ with input *I* can be mapped to a function ƒ' that has *I* equivalently hard coded into ƒ', so we don't actually need *I* in our oracle definition. lastly, i'd like to note this oracle definition is not well-defined in which categorization takes priority for this mapping, but we can ignore this for now.

to get our programmer caps on, i would also like to present this definition in pseudo-code as well:

    halts: (ƒ: string) -> {
      if (/**input function ƒ halts**/)
        return 1
      else
        return 0
    }

this is mostly the same. i would like to note this definition does prioritize returning 1 over 0 where possible, but again we can ignore this for now.

______________

where does the problem arise? there's a particularly problematic function, almost akin to malicious user input, which calls the halting oracle on itself, and then explicitly defies the result it receives:

    halting_paradox: () -> {
      if (halts(halting_paradox))
        loop_forever()
      else
        return
    }

this program lends itself to a troubling paradox: if we set *halts(halting_paradox)* to 1, and perform hatling analysis on the branch after the call... *halting_paradox()* ends up looping forever defying the return. similarly, if we set *halts(halting_paradox)* to 0 and again perform branch halting analysis... the paradox ends up returning immediately, again defying the result. there is seemingly no way to really map this into either the set of functions that halts, or the set of functions that does not... and not have the paradox entirely contract the prescribed set categorization.

and that's where we are today. not only is this paradox used to disprove general halting analysis, it used to disprove a variety of other general analyses for various properties of a program. any oracle that could potentially be used to construct a halting oracle is therefore also thought to be generally undecidable. furthermore this paradox is certainly more universally applicable than just turning machines, it applies to any system of logic which can describe self-referential analysis, including us using our own natural language. not only cannot computers fully map all functions to halts/otherwise, we could not either. this would seem to be not just a limit to computability, but a limit to knowledge itself, if true. 

______________

how can this be wrong? instead of jumping into what may resolve this paradox, i would first like to detail a few odd observations i had about the situation:

1) while it seems impossible to strictly classify the entire program, it is very possible to classify either of the two possible branches that could be taken based on the return from halts(). quite clearly one branch halts, and the other branch loops forever. knowing this is integral to understanding the paradox. the real issue then is deciding which specific branch actually gets taken, because trying to do so and returning that result, leads to halting_paradox() taking the opposite branch, invaliding the decision made. it seems quite odd that while all possible compute paths for this paradox can be decided upon, with the machine seemingly fully understood, putting it all together leads to an undecidable quality.
 
2) while it is impossible to strictly classify halting_paradox(), and return that classification to the halting_paradox() with that classification remaining truthful... it is possible to tell a 3rd, causally independent party what the halting_paradox() will do, and then return the value necessary to get that decided upon behavior. for example: an *annoyed* halting oracle could print to log: “halting_paradox() will halt” and then return 0 to halting_paradox() to make it halt. even if disingenuous, this ability seems quite at odds with the notion that we cannot decide, classify, or even know, whether halting_paradox() halts or not. we certainly do know how halting_paradox() will perform, lest we couldn’t even understand what the paradox means. in some sense the oracle not only decides, but fundamentally determines of it's own ""will"", the result of halting_paradox()... we just cannot return any decision made about it truthfully back to halting_paradox(), or it will contradict that decision.

this leads me to believe that it’s not whether we can decide upon if the halting_paradox() halts or not, that is causing issues. but more so, it is how we go about communicating that decision, that lends itself to paradoxical conclusions.",1724781644,401672,fire_in_the_theater,t2_hnqsrqvv,43955c7ae4aaa348873fe69f8035d2b005dce92cd1321e242857e9f274cdb05f,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f2no73/cracks_in_the_halting_problem/

7625,Fake Email Account,"Not sure if this is the right community....

I used my wife's computer and found a ""fake"" Gmail account in her browser. This account was saved in her Google Chrome under an alternate profile and when I clicked on it, it logged right in to it.

When openeing the emails in the gmail account, there were emails showing it was linked to a ""fake"" Facebook account (claiming it was my wife) at one point as well, but the emails showed the FB account had since been deactivated. There was emails dating back to 2017 in it.

There was nothing listed in the recovery information section and the recent activity section was blank as well.

When I asked my wife about this, she said she had no idea about any of this and never seen that email before. She also said that it must be some kind virus or hacker that caused this.

I have a hard time believing this account was 7 years old and just magically appeared on her PC (PC is maybe 2 years old) along with the password being already manually put in, so by clicking on the account, it would automatically sign you in. It's just her and I in our household.

Looks to me like I caught her red handed with a fake Gmail and Facebook but she swears on it that this wasn't her and it must be fake. I have never caught my wife lying to me in the past and do not have any reason to think she is lying, even though this seems next to impossible for this to happen via a virus/hacker.

So my question is, could a hacker actually do this or is my wife lying?

7640,I personally think that 'skill' is not given the due consideration in Computer language/tool design.,"In my opinion, the majority(all?) of language design concerns are too entrenched in thinking about the best way to solve the problem, finding the right/perfect abstractions that doesn't let the programmers 'commit' mistakes. But, I see a problem here.  I think that's like saying we need to do something about skill issue. 

Instead of incentivizing creative ways to solve problems with a language, the thinking is more towards 'lets dumb down our tools so that we close the skill gaps'. This is excellent for a business & a process which must not suffer. But, why should academia suffer?

Although a lot of thought goes into the design of a programming language & I think its mostly subjective. Industry pushes & promotes stuff as if its new scientific discoveries but all tools are scientific concepts plus conventions. So, that becomes abstract engineering so its still a product of opinion eg. a programming language - which doesn't mean they don't use science, mathematics. 

In all of this, I see that what the designers underestimate is the skill of a programmer with a language which means maybe always thinking about designing better tools & becoming obsessed about it is not the way. Let me give an example of it. Consider Chris Sawyer who created Transport Tycoon in Assembly. Its a huge endeavor for one man. But, when we hear such things, we often hear people gasping wow, he is genius, madman & sweep it under the rug. ""Common man can't aspire to learn to do those things"", ""Problem-solving is hard so lets create some mental constructs so they can create such marvelous things"". 

I was personally struggling with algorithms design & had an insight that high level programming constructs were getting in my way to think about a problem simply rather than helping me. Thankfully, I found Knuth's writing on why he picked assembly for TAOCP & Wirth's books that helped me to think a bit more freely of any baggage of constructs that high level languages provide. On this, SICP did a great disillusionment on me too to try to keep the mind on the problems rather than thinking about language constructs. Surprisingly, I found a book on all this where the author rants for like 1000 pages:  [http://www.softwareandmind.com/](http://www.softwareandmind.com/) 

You might find it provocative & some things silly but there is a point. 

I have a very strong conviction now that no language design can compensate for problem solving skills & few basic but complete tools is the way rather than the industry's way of always thinking about trying to find the next cool casting sub-assembly as a replacement for creative human thinking.",1724912733,401930,Symmetries_Research,t2_opmsc6qb,826ebc297b4b146019d8e74f1560ed91b46e6ff52525b5909bd63bf4d9e37fb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f3vmbo/i_personally_think_that_skill_is_not_given_the/

7658,How to read documentation?,"Hello!  
  
I am not a CS graduate or IT professional, but I enjoy computers a lot and I like to keep small projects as well as code for fun.  
  
It just occurred to me that whenever I have an issue I YouTube tutorials and just apply each step by imitation, without fully understanding what I’m doing.  
  
I reckon this is suboptimal, and I would like to improve: could you share how do you read - and understand- documentation?  
  
I wouldn’t know where to start googling in the first place.  
  
For example, I want to learn more about docker and the Terminal, or numpy.  
  
Do I read the whole documentation and then try to do what I need? Or do I do little by little and test it at each step?  
  
How do I understand what I can do, say, with docker? (Just as an example, don’t bother explaining :))  
  
Imagine you’re teaching your grandma how to google.

7666,Node.js or Java for Backend? Seeking Advice for Fullstack Transition!,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice. I've been working as a frontend developer for almost 2 years now, mainly with React, React Native, and Redux. I want to level up and become a fullstack developer, so I'm diving into backend development.

Initially, I thought of learning Node.js since it uses JavaScript, which I’m already comfortable with. But one of my seniors suggested I should consider Java because it’s more powerful and could lead to better job opportunities.

Here's where I’m stuck:

1. **Familiarity**: I know JavaScript pretty well, so picking up Node.js might be easier and faster for me.
2. **Learning Curve**: I’m a bit of a slow learner, and Java would be completely new territory, meaning I’d have to start from scratch.
3. **Career Prospects**: While Node.js seems like the easier path, Java supposedly offers more robust capabilities and better job prospects.

For those of you who have experience with both or have made the transition from frontend to fullstack, what would you advise? Should I go with Node.js for a smoother learning experience, or should I tackle Java for potentially better career opportunities?

7673,on the halting oracle: a practical programmer's perspective,"hey again! back with more issues with the halting problem.

this time i'd like to take a look at some oddities of the proposed halting oracle itself. i'd like to do so from a more practical perspective that most people have, given that they have since all assumed it was uncomputable and therefore unusable. 😅

let's go back to our definition of the halting oracle [given previously](https://old.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f2no73/cracks_in_the_halting_problem/):

    halts: (ƒ: function) -> {
      1: function ƒ halts
      0: otherwise
    }

it's formatted a bit differently than the way [turing phrased it](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf#page=18), but it's functionally the same:

> we can invent a machine *D* which, when supplied with the S.D of any computing
machine *M* will test this S.D and if *M* is circular will mark the S.D with the
symbol ""u"" and if it is circle-free will mark it with ""s"". 

^(by S.D he meant standard description, or the code of the function. and circle/circle-free correspond to the 0/1 returns from above)

as i was thinking about this problem, i started thinking about the oracle as a programmer trying to use it as a given api. and there's a series of annoying flaws in this as a practical function we'd actually want to use. 

first, it can be contradicted quite easily in one of the most obvious use cases for such an oracle: as a guard against producing accidental loops, in the not so uncommon use of just gating the whole program for safety.

it seems to work just fine when one isn't messing up:

    my_halting_function: () -> {
      if (halts(my_halting_function))
        does_stuff()
      else
        console.error('loop detected');
    }

but like, how often do we just program right along without bugs? and if we accidentally create a loop in our code, then what... the guard just breaks down and suddenly becomes uncomputable?? 

    my_undecidable_function: () -> {
      if (halts(my_undecidable_function))
        accidental_loop()
      else
        console.error('loop detected')
    }

what even happens now, the oracle does some sort of segfault to break out? ""uncomputable value"" caused a blue screen of death?! woops, not again! lol

unless ... if u make ur error path a loop of printing errors, then it doesn't break. because the 0 return is consistent with the else branch, this is actually totally sensible:

    my_looping_function: () -> {
      if (halts(my_looping_function))
        accidental_loop()
      else
        while(true) console.error('loop detected')
    }

but putting a loop in ur else branch just makes it weirder, cause now when u don't mess up, the code becomes not undecidable, but actually indeterminate:

    my_indeterminate_function: () -> {
      if (halts(my_indeterminate_function))
        return
      else
        while(true) console.error('loop detected')
    }

both returns from halts(), 0 or 1, satisfy the logic as stipulated in the oracle definition, so the halting oracle basically just gets to choose how ur code runs without violating it's logical contract... so who even knows what's gunna happen when u run it??

sheesh, what a painful kind of programming this is.

yeah yeah, i know what ur thinking: *that's what u get for tryin to use an undecidable oracle u dope*

ok you, that's a point 🙄

ain't gunna stop me from wondering:

7716,feeling extremely overwhelmed as a CS freshman ,"this was my first week and I knew that CS is NOT easy at all but Idk if it’s the professors that I got or me but its all too much. I have never been this stressed before. I keep doubting if I even chose the right major. I love computers and the idea of coding I like math too but some math professor are just not it. I love math when I understand it and is well taught by a good professor. I feel extremely behind in my pre calculus class every one seems to get it and I simply don’t. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I go back home have to self teach myself the topic because my professor doesn’t, all they do is go extremely fast over a homework problem. I all get is get assigned videos and texts. I learn engaging and visuals live with someone and I feel like I am self teaching myself everything what is the point of attending if all I get are order to go back home to watch videos. I am so frustrated and stressed. I have never felt this left and dumb before. as to for my CS class everyone seems to have prior experience with coding which makes me also feel behind. the professor I got is very good but they assign a lot of reading, like there is no tomorrow. idk if I suffer from something but I have problems concentrating for long periods of time which makes me terrible with reading long bodies of text. I hate reading absurdly long texts. I am a visual and interactive learner. it’s so hard for me to learn through reading words. it’s so insane how stressful this is. am I the only one feeling like this? everyone seems to get it but me I have felt in so way extremely down and with low esteem. it’s all too much. is something wrong with me?",1725176484,402737,Anxious-Chest6410,t2_m4o3gc10r,6920c59587a288a8b01748b5358c2ab020475cb0e5c41d268ee816135b6869e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f690fn/feeling_extremely_overwhelmed_as_a_cs_freshman/

7728,"First ""On campus placement experience"" might help you to placed","""Let's talk about my first placement experience today. I'm a computer science student currently pursuing my degree.

So, the placement season has started, and companies have begun visiting our college. Last Thursday, I filled out the form for Pie Infotech's on-campus placement. 

I was both excited and a little nervous because, until now, I had only heard stories about placements and interviews, but had never experienced them in reality.

The first round was an aptitude test, which I cleared, and I was extremely happy about it. But in that happiness, I didn't realize that I should have talked to someone with experience for advice before the next round—consider this my mistake. The next round was a group discussion, and we were divided into groups. Our topic was 'Education should be compulsory for politicians,' and we were against the motion.

 Although I had a little experience with group discussions and had even read the rules before entering the hall, the real story began when the group discussion started. Our team took the initiative with the first point, and after that, the group discussion turned into a debate show like you see on TV. I was caught in a dilemma—whether to speak up or not—because what was happening was the complete opposite of what I had read in the group discussion rules. So, I started waiting for my turn, which was probably my mistake. Then the HR gave the conclusion: 'Thank you for your time, we have selected our team.' I was surprised because I hadn't said anything.And as expected, I was eliminated in the second round. My excitement fell from the sky to the ground in an instant.'Then I realized that no matter what happens, you shouldn't wait for someone else's cue; you have to muster the courage to confidently present your point of view and just speak without being nervous.'Although I wasn't selected, it was a good experience 😅.

 I'm writing this here so that whenever you find yourself in a similar situation, make sure you're well-prepared in advance.""",1725214184,402856,eric-4u,t2_tfr0ddgzx,fe7fbb04fcf656985c5427244db333d0577f4909aa45c132e876b46fee8b4bb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f6kxl5/first_on_campus_placement_experience_might_help/

My plan is to take 2 years of CS at my local community college to get an associates degree for free, and then transfer to a uni to complete my degree.

I am in a class named ""Computer Systems and Performance"" and we are using the book ""Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition - The Hardware Software Interface"" by David Patterson and John Hennesy.

7775,Explaining determinism in computer science to kids aged 8-12,"Explain to Ages: 8-12  
This is what I have:  
  
Let's introduce a new term: determinism. Don't worry about how many syllables it has; just try to understand what it means.  
  
Computers are deterministic. The same input will cause the same output. Let's look at something in life that might be considered deterministic.   
  
DOMINOS!!! Not the pizza. 

What happens when you set up dominos, and push the first one? They fall one after the other. The precise placement of dominos determines the pattern of their fall. If you set up the same dominos again and again, they will fall in the same way. If one is set differently the whole outcome can change. Computers' instructions are like dominos. Each instruction is run after another creating the same outcome every time. Adding millions of numbers can be similar to seeing the dominos fall. In the coming chapters, we will find out how computer programs are as simple as setting up dominos, and running them is as beautiful as seeing thousands of dominos fall.

  
Context: I am writing a lesson plan. Where we do a few exercises, like making a human draw a house, and then try it with a computer. The idea is to do two exercises related to two different types of problems and see which problems are simple enough to be solved by a traditional computer. 

Need a little clarity on whether deterministic problems are the best to be solved with computers as their inputs and outputs can be reliably tested.",1725387771,403320,jawnJawnHere,t2_nehef39r,49e85aad17c4746b94a76736ae8034e55466d2a26d24638daaafba2da759cc41,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f878d1/explaining_determinism_in_computer_science_to/

7826,Is this a appropriate method of representing a graph?,"Basically i have a graph of lets say rooms(vertex) each connected(edges) to other bunch of rooms for my game.  Tho each room is  connected to another  room  in a   certain  direction. For example, there are 4 types of edges as in directions like right, left, up, down a room can be connected to. And ofc a room can not connect to more than one unique room in a certain direction like for example, room 1 can not be connected to room 2 and room 3 in its upward direction but only to either room 2 or 3. Also if lets say room 1's upward is room 2 then room 2's downward is room 1 its inversly proportionate. 

Lets say  the graph that i represented above can be represented by this data structure(visually represented above)

The data structure i used is a arraylist of arraylist of linked list to represent a graph with its unique edges types L,R,U,D or left right up down..

The index of the first arraylist is the current players vertex which it references a arraylist of linked list whose index of the secondary arraylist is left up down,right connections. Each of those directions hold references of the linked list of actual rooms. The first node of linked list is the vertex to which which the current is connected directly to, which the second node is the direct connection to head node in linked list in that same direction, and the third is the vertex directly cnnected to second in the same direction and so on. So if we were to travel L,L the rooms we passed through would be A,B,D. If L,D then we would pass through A,B,C.

7832,on the enumerability of computable numbers,"sup dudes, back with the halting paradox!

but this time on an issue from which the paradox arose: enumerating computable numbers! a computable number is a real number that can be computed to the nth-digit, by a finite-state, computational machine that takes input n. in turing's seminal paper, his main goal was to prove through several means that computable numbers were not enumerable.

unfortunately, even though he spent half the paper proving that said machines can be fully described by a natural number (turing calls these D.N. for designated numbers), he missed the full gravity of this connection that stands very much in contrast with the the rest of his paper’s followup discussion:

*computable numbers are bijectable on a set of finite-state machines which uniquely compute them, which in turn are bijectable on a set of natural numbers which uniquely and fully describe them, so therefore computable numbers must be enumerable, as all sets of natural numbers are enumerable Q.E.D.*

tbh i feel that stands on its own as self-evident, but turning brought up a lot of confusion with his paper. so since then theorists have since devised such notions of ""countability"" vs ""recursive enumerability"" to deal with the conflicts brought up,

but what the heck is that even? the integral quality of an enumerable set, one that can be bijected on the set of natural numbers, is that we know they can be listed out with discrete steps between them. with these steps, we gain certainty of an ability to methodically assign a natural number to each member in the set. this is called **counting** them.

somehow that has gotten lost on sets that are ""countable"" but not ""recursively enumerable""? supposedly, we can prove they are count-able, or able-to-be-counted, but we have no finite method of actually undertaking the process of counting up to any particular n of them. for if we did, we would have a way of encoding that into a finite state machine, contrary to what turing then tries to prove with the halting paradox. accepting his proofs in §8 doesn’t just debunk a computer's ability to compute them, it's a proof against *our own innate ability* to count them.

let me direct: if we do not have a method to *find_set_member(n)* ... then that isn't a countable/enumerable set. and if we don't have that, we've lost all meaning of the bijection between said set and the natural numbers.

you might try to claim to me: ahhh, even if we know about that bijection, we just can’t know what the bijection actually is. and to this i respond: *edi wow*, such unobtainable “knowledge” that is! We know this mapping must exist, but we cannot know it?

how can knowledge even exist, if it cannot possibly be known ...",1725555193,403747,fire_in_the_theater,t2_hnqsrqvv,be6d92664979951c4673ba87733ae82e2aa008b4b753e6966ec5f2c24c42a5b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1f9raek/on_the_enumerability_of_computable_numbers/

7835,Any fictional magic systems that implicitly treat P=NP?,"Fictional magic systems seem to mostly manipulate physical objects. E.g., “fireball”, “fly”, “accio”.

Some spells have mental effects that aren’t trivial to explain with a reductionist physicalist metaphysics. E.g., “charm person”, “imperio”.

Some few spells seem to manipulate information. E.g., “comprehend languages”.

Are there any fictional magic systems with spells that directly rely on P=NP? The closest thing I can think of is the d&d spell “locate object” that lets you sense the direction of an object that’s familiar to you. The warlock invocation “eyes of the rune keeper” says “you can read all writing”, but the game developer Jeremy Crawford has specified that it will not let you understand encoded meaning.

From what I can gather, it seems like ILs are a subset of IRs, and bytecode is a subset of IL. But what exactly makes them different? That's the part where I keep running into conflicting answers. Some sources say intermediate languages are IRs that are meant to be executed in a virtual machine or runtime environment for the purpose of portability, like Java bytecode. Other sources say that's what bytecode is, whereas ILs are a broad term for languages used at various stages of compilation, below the source code and above machine code, and are not necessarily meant to be executed directly. Then other source say no, that definition is for IRs, not ILs.

I had zero experience with coding before but the short time I had I thought the whole idea was really fascinating. I have always loved and been good at math and science, and wondering if getting into machine learning would be a good career move… I have heard CS is oversaturated right now as well so I don’t even know if there’s a need? Nursing informatics is also a possibility one day but I don’t think I have enough bedside experience to be able to get into that any time soon.

Of course, I am aware that the market for tech is saturated which is both disappointing and scary because I am actually interested in getting into the field. I especially am interesting in becoming a software developer as I heard they can also get into the gaming industry. However, I am open to getting whatever role I can find like data analytics. 

I also heard that there is age discrimination in the field and considering that I am 24 with no degree, I would be 28 if I were to commit to CS degree. Not sure if that is considered old by tech industry standards.

It's pretty simple in operation. Given a random point it draws a line then bisects that line and begins a binary search until it can't find anywhere else to search.

Is this an algorithm that's already in use for other purposes? I'd love to know about them. For this particular purpose it works well enough. Since it's only searching from the center of the previous line in the stack it tends to leave single pixel islands and I'm currently trying to figure out if there's a good way of handling these islands. They always have similar properties so I think that I can figure something out!

7928,Career Advice,"Hello everyone, I have bachelors in computer science and I’ve been working for a year as a software developer. I work mostly on full stack and backend technologies and build use cases using large language models. It’s been fun and a great start to my career. I like coding and enjoyed it more when I had to account for performance or taking architectural decisions. But the platform I work on is simply an internal tool meant to increase the productivity of employees. I feel like at the end of the day, it’s just a nice add on and I’m not really making much of a difference. And also I never got to know anything about the business since I wasn’t working on anything to enhance the business process. I’m deeply interested in interdisciplinary fields where computer science can help like finance, health and climate. I want to work on something groundbreaking. I’m going to go for masters soon and I need some help in figuring out what to do. Sometimes I really wish I did my degree in some other field like the sciences or finance so that learning computer science would have helped me APPLY it to those fields. Because now it feels like I need to have an understanding of the problems in different domains to use computer science to solve them. I’m not inclined to doing a phD since it requires way too much time and effort (atleast in the US). I’ve seen a lot of specialised degrees like cognitive science, data science for health etc. How are the career prospects for such degrees? Mind you, I’ll be an international student so I’ll have issues with work visa sponsorship etc. I’m mainly looking at USA, Canada and Germany for my studies.

7933,Bipartite Graphs,"An undirected graph *G* is called bipartite when it is possible to partition the set *V* of its vertices into two sets, *A* and *B*, such that for every edge, one end belongs to *A* and the other to *B*. More colloquially, it is often interpreted as the vertices assigned to set *A* being colored blue and those assigned to set *B* being colored red. Thus, in this way, a graph can be considered bipartite **if it is possible to color its vertices with two colors, such that the ends of each edge have different colors**.

Thinking about what types of graphs are not bipartite can give an idea of some necessary conditions for the above property to hold. For example, if there is a triangle and one vertex is colored red and another blue, any color assigned to the remaining vertex will conflict with one of its two neighbors.

In general, if an odd-length cycle exists with the vertices numbered *1, 2, …, 2k, 2k + 1*. Assuming that the odd vertices are colored red and the even ones are blue up to vertex *2k* when it comes time to assign a color to vertex *2k + 1*, no color assigned to it will be valid because it shares an edge with a blue-colored vertex and another with a red-colored one.

7951,What gimbol lock is and what gimbol lock is not. ,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal\_lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock)

One of the most confusing parts of explanations of gimbol lock is in particular in the context of Pitch, Yaw, and Roll.

When we talk about Pitch Yaw and Roll we are talking about rotations about axis's built from the planes axis, say roll around the X axis, pitch around the Y axis,and Yaw around the Z axis.

The explanation of using gimbal rings to model this is very confusing, since these axis are always perpindicular along each other. They also don't represent true Euler angles , since a pitch of 40 degrees followed by a yaw of 40 degrees followed by a roll of 40 degrees followed by a pitch of 30 degrees is not the same as pitch of 70 degrees a yaw of 40 degrees and a roll of 40 degrees.

When you use gimbal rings you are making future-spinning rings changing of the current spin axis, and you want the Euler angles to actually be additive. One thing you can say about the Pitch Yaw and Roll scenario is that with ""gimbol lock"" you are making it so that there is a non-deterministic set of Euler angles to get to the current rotation.",1725954267,404734,PranosaurSA,t2_ggbty5t0g,8b3a47e7fb1b22d41f90bb3497ef54369ee895ffbd775bfd8f468ff40124611e,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fdcdgr/what_gimbol_lock_is_and_what_gimbol_lock_is_not/

7968,on the mistake in turing's diagonal,"hello all, still thinking about that darned halting problem! today, i desire to talk about why turing went down the thread of constructing it, and the mistake that lead to him to do so.

this first point he considers in §8 of this seminal paper ""on computable numbers..."" is a cantor style argument on the enumerability of computable numbers. he had already spend half the paper proving that computable number can be bijected onto the natural numbers via the description number of the machine that computes them, so if cantor's inverse diagonal (which turing called β) could be produced for the enumeration of these numbers... there'd be a huge ruh-roh!

given these new machines he just described, turing thought there might be an easy way to do so: one could construct a machine that enumerates over these numbers, and for every nth-machine, returns the opposite of the nth-value to construct an inverse diagonal that cannot exist in that enumeration of computable numbers. to make this this easier to reason about, let me give modern pseudo-code for computing this:

    inverse_diagonal = (n: number) -> {
      count = 0
      for (comptuable_number) in (enumerate.computable_numbers()) {
        if (count < n)
          count += 1
        else
          return computable_number(n) ? 0 : 1
      }
    }

    enumerate_diagonal = () -> {
      for (n = 0; true; n++) print inverse_diagonal(n);
    }

now turing did correct point out the fallacy of just assuming this to be computable, something which cantor's argument on real numbers does not need to abide by. but he went a swing and a miss on what this isn't. now, his reasoning was that in order to even just enumerate over computable numbers, one would need to ensure the would halt for every input n. so doing so would be akin to solving the halting problem, which he asserted wasn't possible. which to me is just confusing... his motivation for debunking this diagonal was presumably to keep computable numbers enumerable, but then he left them in a state where we can't construct this diagonal, because there can be no method of actually enumerating over these computable numbers? it's like dude: are these computable numbers, which u just bijected on the natural numbers, able to be enumerated, or not?! why must you assert they are impossible to enumerate, when that could just be hard? have some humility, eh?

there is a simpler and more coherent reason for why this inverse diagonal cannot be computed: at some input n, `comptuable_number = inverse_diagonal`, so the diagonal would have to compute its own inverse... and that falls prey to the very problem of infinite recursion turing tries with the halting paradox, on the very next page! you might suggest that in such a case the machine could return any number. but the problem with doing so is if the return is not an inverse of some number on the diagonal, then at that point you could insert this computed β into the list. cantor's diagonal requires an inverse at every point of the diagonal, even just one non-inverse return breaks down the proof!

it's a bit odd he didn't notice this since quite clearly he understood the problem of infinite recursion, but alas here we are. there is furthermore evidence he did not see this in the last paragraph of p246:

> The simplest and most direct proof of [no general halting function] is by showing that, if this general process exists, then there is a machine which computes β. This proof, although perfectly sound, has the disadvantage that it may leave the reader with a feeling that ""**there must be something wrong**""

indeed there was something very wrong with his intuition. regardless of whether the halting problem is solvable or not, this inverse diagonal cannot be produced for the enumeration of computable numbers. the nature of being enumerable prevents the construction of an inverse diagonal.

turing simply did not need to construct this halting problem proof against β, something that honestly also conflicts with the enumerability of computable numbers.",1725984429,404819,fire_in_the_theater,t2_hnqsrqvv,b19fc5a5dc23ac243e13f9dbb7b12b44feb642546f45dc73240925c2aa1d96c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fdllsd/on_the_mistake_in_turings_diagonal/

I haven't optimized it yet, so there's room for improvement. It's different than any other sorting algorithm I've seem out there. Started off as a joke when I was bored, but then it actually started winning by a lot...

1. Learning the fundamentals of computer networks. I need to get the fundamentals out of the way, to which it can later on help me with diving deep into the nitty gritty stuff of computer networks.

2. Basically the reason I am learning this field because I want to try creating my own unique network architecture and maybe try building it and experimenting with myself. I just wanna mention this part so that all the computer network geeks reading this can actually try to understand what exactly I'm learning all this for. 

  
I'm happy to answer more questions if this sounds vague, but I am seriously super invested in this field. I just need guidance, advice, and tips from those who are experienced and knowledgeable about this field so I can be learning in the right path and all.

  
Thanks!",1726095651,405001,RRfyOfficial,t2_4tf32gex,467bb137b662b544293e205aa58aca9bf2723aff4c94c5852ce424ce5c81f67f,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fenrp7/resource_recommendations_for_building_computer/

8010,How does an ISP create internet?,"Hello internet stangers. My hyperfixation has gotten the best of me and I wanted to ask a very technical question. I understand that the Internet is a series of interconnected but mostly decentralized servers (in the most basic sense). However to me that still does not answer all my questions on internet connectivity. Hope I can explain it well enough. When a computer connects to a router, the router assigns the user a private IP adress through the DHCP, then it also assigns the a public IP to connect to the greater internet. However, you cannot connect to the greater public Internet without the help of an internet service provider. How come? My question, I suppose, is how is an ISP's specific array of servers capable of providing a connection for a private host. If the Internet is a series of decentralized servers and an ISP is technically just another one, then why is it through their service only that we are capable of accessing the rest of the internet? What is this connection they provide? Is it just available data lines? To clarify, I am not talking about the physical connection between the user and other servers/data centers. I understand that well enough. I am talking purely on the technical standpoint of why does the connection to the rest of the internet, and the accessing of a public IP have to go through an ISP? Is it just the fact that they are handing out public IP's? Maybe I'm just uneducated on where to find this information.

8018,Handling Semaphore Synchronization Issues in Single-Core and Multi-Core Systems,"In a single-core system with multi-threading, a problem can occur with the `down(s)` function of a semaphore. When a thread checks the condition `if (s == 0)` in `down(s)`, a context switch may happen right after the check but before the semaphore is decremented. This can cause another thread to execute, leading to incorrect behavior or blocking of other threads. This problem can be addressed in a sequential (single-core) system in two ways:

1. **Disabling Interrupts:** Temporarily disable interrupts before entering the `if` condition in the `down(s)` function. This prevents context switches during the critical check, ensuring atomicity.
2. **Combining Assembly Instructions:** Use a combination of two assembly instructions, `jmp` and `cmp`, to perform the check and action in a single atomic step. Since these instructions are executed together, no context switch can occur between them, effectively achieving the same result as `if (s == 0)` without interruption.

Now, in a multi-core system, where threads run in parallel on different cores, the problem with semaphores and critical sections is more complex due to potential race conditions and inconsistent memory visibility across cores. What happens if multiple threads perform `down(s)` concurrently? The solution in multi-core systems involves using atomic operations, spinlocks, memory barriers, or higher-level synchronization primitives to ensure correct synchronization and avoid race conditions.",1726135924,405094,Tormentally,t2_ywx9h,7a96c46440ca472436ee3ac443c530e25fbfd342f6a4664fe329e9edd2daf247,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1feyzzd/handling_semaphore_synchronization_issues_in/

8044,Patriot Missile System Case Study: Clock Drift Confusion,"I just learned about clock drift in my real time systems course and the example of the Patriot Missile System was used to exemplify the seriousness of clock drift. For those who haven't heard of this:

[https://www.gao.gov/assets/imtec-92-26.pdf](https://www.gao.gov/assets/imtec-92-26.pdf)

One thing I don't understand is why the absolute system clock time drifting affected the tracking systems? Shouldn't only the time elapsed between two different radar pulses be used for tracking? This article briefly mentions this point:

[https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/\~arnold/disasters/Patriot-dharan-skeel-siam.pdf](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/Patriot-dharan-skeel-siam.pdf)

*""This does not really explain the tracking errors, however, because the tracking of a missile should depend not on the absolute clock-time but rather on the time that elapsed between two different radar pulses. And because of the consistency of the errors, this time difference should be in error by only 0.0001%, a truly insignificant amount.""*

It goes on to explain how inconsistency in the use of a subroutine to improve clock-time to floating-point was used inconsistently which meant the error didn't cancel out.

This still doesn't make sense to me though? How could increasingly worse clock drift affect elapsed time calculations? Shouldn't only the drift *between* the radar pulses (in and out) matter when tracking a single missile?",1726194787,405200,ArcticEH,t2_21iqur20,524c62901d160566c8de2973ec753fba77ddb209f17ccf0534052bd9369bde11,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ffk6mm/patriot_missile_system_case_study_clock_drift/

I first had to figure out how to put pixel on the screen, so I coded my custom subroutine in 8086 assembly for it. 0A000h is memory-mapped address for VRAM, and we should put the intending color into this address. A high level representation of formula is vram[320*y+x] = color. I did some optimization since x86 MUL instruction is so slow. The optimized version is vram[(y << 8) + (y << 6) + x] = color. I tried to zoom in/out but it was too slow, it seems it is not possible on this machine.

Ever since i was a little brat, I was always on the computer and loved it. Now I'm 26 and realized that, i never took my hobby further. 

My brain has been flooding lately with thoughts like: 

- How do I design custom computers and crazy whacky cases  
- How do I build a console with my emulators on it (like those consoles on AliExpress with emulated games)  
- How are all these hardware's built to begin with, like a CPU, at such a microscopic level  
- How did sandisk manage to fit 1tb in a microsd card, whats the limiting factor in data size and physical size.   
- How to solder wires and why would one do that  
- How build to build game boy from the ground up  
etc.....

Is there schooling for this in USA? Is it engineer? What if I want to study this? are there schools for it? I would like to be pointed to the right direction. Also what type of jobs involve Electronics/Hardware because I think id have so much fun doing it. Thanks. 

I'm not a fan of coding or software. I can get around tweaking  or like fetus level coding but i noticed I really like the hardware. Thanks for the info.

So far the coding languages I've been introduced to are intro to c++, intro to python, and intro to java. I've also taken a bunch of other classes that are required but basically my knowledge on coding is stuff like simple programs. (Like fake savings account deposit/withdraw, check if something is a prime number, guessing game). 

Am I where I'm supposed to be? I don't have any coding classes next semester and I definitely am no where near close to coding the stuff I see online (I tried to look up how to code flappy bird lol). It made sense on like a ""Oh these terms are familiar"" kinda way but not something I ever could make up off the top of my head and implement. 

Is it one of those things where when I enter my junior and senior year things get serious and I learn things I would need to learn to get a job or am I wayyy behind on the curve and need to start looking at some classes and/or readings outside of my college?

Also any and all advice in general on what I should do to for my future and any suggestions on things I should familiarize myself with immediately are greatly appreciated!!!

2. Prove that if f(n) and g(n) are nonnegative functions such that f(n) = O(g(n)), f(n) + g(n) = Ω(g(n))

I had always assumed that when you want directions say on Google maps, that calculation is not done on your phone/local computer, but rather your input of start/end point is passed to a compute farm, it calculates, and passes the result back to display. Is this correct?

With the new laptops coming out with art intell chips, my thoughts run the same. The large part of this is training the models, which requires massive compute horsepower. Which is up on compute farm again. Same this once the model is trained, and you ask a question that has a trained model. I am assuming you are just passing the request up and the compute farms gets you the answer.

8121,How to implement this?,"
Hello,

The appearance of a form only after pressing a button.

Imagine you have a button that is called ""register."" You don't want the user to go to another page, you want to fetch the form inside some container in the page. How would you do this?

  
The only two ways that come to my mind are:

  
1. Fetch the form information using JSON and build it with JavaScript.

2. Display/hide the container itself with CSS and JS.

  
What I don't like about the first option is that building HTML with JavaScript can become overly complicated and simply looks horrible. I'm yet to find a technique other than createEement that is actually suitable. I mean, you an use strings ('<.../>') but that's probably not the most professional way of doing things.

  
What I don't like about the second one, is that the code is there, but you don't want it there yet and, second, if you have to parse different forms depending on the button the user presses, you will end up with a lot of CSS display/hide that can end up in also a mess.

  
How would you do this?

  
Thanks.",1726494544,405858,anth3nna,t2_vj0tbn66,981d51fba1fdf2dd2ac9414b81820e3b808a73897ac1176513b4e9629639472f,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fi544n/how_to_implement_this/

Is it better to malloc one big blob of data (with a max of 32k or something) and use that for different data structures. Or is it better to do multiple mallocs? I can imagine 1 is better because the data lives continuous in the same adress space. So concrete example:

Void* data = malloc(100)
Int *a = data[0] 
Int *b = data[4]

Vs 

Int *a = malloc(4)
Int *b = malloc(4)

I know really crude example but the point is that calling malloc two times can make the data scattered through the memory right?

8184,Conway's Game of Life on MSDOS ,"I’ve recently been exploring low-level programming on MS-DOS and decided to take on a fun project: implementing Conway’s Game of Life. For those unfamiliar, it’s a simple cellular automaton where you define an initial grid, and it evolves based on a few basic rules.
Given MS-DOS’s constraints—limited memory, CPU cycles, and no modern graphical libraries—I had to work directly with the hardware, writing to the video memory for efficient rendering. I’ve played around with 8086 assembly before, optimizing pixel manipulation in VRAM, and that experience came in handy for making the grid redraw as fast as possible.

8224,How to Represent Single-Variable Functions Using Functional Graphs,"**Note:** The full version of this post is available [here](https://albexl.substack.com/p/functional-graphs).

# Context 📝

Functional graphs, being a very particular type of directed graph, can be a solution pathway to fascinating problems. The analogy made with single-variable functions consists of interpreting these graphs as a function with a domain in the set of integers belonging to the interval *\[1, n\]*. The edges of this graph are then defined by a function *f(x)*, which assigns, for every *x ∈ \[1, n\]*, a value *y* that is the successor of *x*. This characteristic structure is present in various contexts and has some properties that allow for its identification.

[A functional graph and its corresponding single-variable function.](https://preview.redd.it/50h877xh1ypd1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d18dbffbb1e5ad37f954d37694708eb2ec37736)

A specific example of these graphs can be seen in [permutations](https://albexl.substack.com/p/trees-permutations-and-number-theory). A permutation *p* of size *n* is a list that contains all the integers from *1* to *n* exactly once. Therefore, a permutation is a function that assigns to each *1 ≤ i ≤ n* a value *pi*.

Problems involving permutations frequently appear in the context of competitive programming. The peculiarity of these, when interpreted as functional graphs, is that each node belongs to a cycle in this graph. This structure is very convenient, which is why problems related to this type of list generally result in much simpler solutions than their corresponding versions in sets that are not permutations.

[A permutation is a single-variable function. Functional graphs corresponding to permutations are always a set of cycles.](https://preview.redd.it/fbprhxfk1ypd1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2de19c4906361c10151d10bf3e6997c2194bb2d)

The fact that functional graphs contain cycles and that each node can reach exactly one cycle is a property that is often exploited in specific problems. Since it is known that if a sufficiently long traversal is started, a cycle will be reached from any vertex, it is possible to find problems dealing with simulating infinite but cyclical processes. In such tasks, functional graphs are always a good option.

However, not only is the property of cycles relevant, but the ability of these graphs to solve the *k-th* successor problem in *O(log k)* time allows for more complex queries that involve finding successors. For example, if each edge had an associated value in addition to indicating the direction, it might be interesting to answer questions such as the sum of the values of the edges in a path of length *k* starting from vertex *u*. Generally, any operation that satisfies the associative property, such as **sum** or **minimum**, can be computed using the binary lifting method.

Finally, some vertices belong to a cycle, and others do not. Therefore, in problems involving functional graphs, it is expected to find that the solution consists of analyzing each vertex type independently. Perhaps the idea behind a problem is to separate the algorithm into two cases and combine their solutions to obtain the overall answer.

[Partition of the set of vertices depending on whether they belong to a cycle or not.](https://preview.redd.it/xkhdufzl1ypd1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=700624c1db199db2fde32cea85f3114081852d81)

*The next edition related to* ***functional graphs*** *will start covering sample problems so we can begin experiencing the thinking process and solution implementation of these tasks hands-on.*

8261,Spinning 3D cube in mode 13h,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been working on a fun little project: rendering a spinning 3D cube in Mode 13h using MS-DOS. It’s part of a retro coding journey I’m on, and I’ve been digging into low-level graphics programming. For those unfamiliar, Mode 13h is a 256-color VGA mode with a 320x200 resolution. It’s often used in early game development because of its direct access to video memory, which makes it great for pixel manipulation.

I’m currently implementing basic 3D transformations (rotation, projection, etc.), and I’m keeping things simple with wireframe rendering for now. The cube spins smoothly, but as expected with these old-school limitations, optimizing the performance has been quite a challenge!

What I’ve done so far:
- 3D vertex transformations using matrix multiplication
- Perspective projection to simulate depth
- Drawing lines between vertices to create the cube’s edges
- Double buffering to reduce flicker

Challenges:
- Keeping the frame rate up in Mode 13h can be tough, especially since the CPU does most of the work.
- I might try to implement basic shading next, but that’s still up in the air.

Next steps:
- Smooth out the rotation to make the animation more fluid
- Possibly try out filled polygons instead of wireframes

- Optimizing the math for transformations—I've been playing with fixed-point arithmetic to speed things up.

- Explore hardware optimizations if possible

1. “Access” – as a verb, this was supposedly controversial… “accessed, accessing, etc.” with people saying just to say “make access to” or “gain access to”. Dictionaries seem to have caught up. 

2. “Kill” meaning “terminate”. Apple banned this in their style guide for being too violent. 

3. “Master” – for referring to a master/slave relationship.

4. “Illegal” – for something not literally illegal but not recognizable by a standard compiler for a given programming language. 

5. “Hacking” – what is it, exactly? A way to make programming sound badass in advertisements for hackathons? Is a hack job a half-assed maneuver or a clever one? Does security hacking refer specifically to illegal cracking or can it also refer to cracking sanctioned by the NSA? 

6. “Function” – “That word is taken by algebra.”  ",1727137172,407298,transtown,t2_n8nmwz51m,729610343e23c924b4a3f2f422a19cfff125b4e41e0068fc435a35581d0638f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fnzmew/what_terms_have_historically_been_controversial/

Given a grammar it generates the FIRST, FOLLOW, automaton, parse table and parsing steps of a string. Once written the grammar you can also write a string to be parsed and it will show the parse tree. There is also a typescript code runner that allows you to run code using the parser you just created.

8332,Computer Science career dilemma medical? forensics? volunteering?,"Alright so, I've been involved in CS since a very tender age (programming since 7years old something)-- I've always been immensely interested in "" what ifs "" of computer science generally, wanted to make up some patents wrote around a few researches on ML etc etc you get the point I like what it has to provide me with. It's been a hobby for a while now I decided to make it full time but I was flabbergasted at how saturated the field is and how legit so many people are forced into CS regardless of hating the subject. It scared me...but then I questioned myself "" well, I see no reason to be scared if I don't care about what I get from the field rather what I do in the field "" but then that thought was quickly dismissed after my first few internships...redundant work...extremely burning out nothing thrilling felt like an emotion less person after every achievement, constant comparisons with people with higher knowledge (I'm competitive)...a lot of my traits clashed the normal corporate environment-- so I went back home started learning more participating in hackathons creating novel stuff it healed me...I found even more joy in the idea of start-ups, working hard and being overwhelmingly happy at achievements. You pretty much understand that I love an variable life with new stuff all the time. 

I also realised that I love immediate dopamine...there was a time when I considered MEDICAL...because I get to participate and communicate with people have a sense of "" accomplishment "" once you prescribe them anything. Or helping out in pet stores, zoos, gardening etc (nurturing activities). 

With all that I know about myself I do good in solving stuff, I like solving stuff and I like it when it makes an impact so that not a big ass corporate company gets the credit rather I see immediate results...I can not emphasise how the code I write or whatever I design can be accepted today additionally saturated with another 100 people just like me working on it and could be dismissed and a few other 400 people can replace whatever me and that other 100 people built. I considered forensics, I considered it a lot because it just was the right fit for whatever I'm describing right now.

But...but I genuinely like studying CS, I thought I could still keep it as a hobby and pursue what I see will be working out for me in the long run but I'm sort of in denial, as I really do want to study this subject, invent things collaborate, research and idk start start-ups do random shit but I at the same time love nurturing activities and activities which make a direct impact, impact which is loud and impact which is personal and individual.

8357,"I'm planning on building a ""solver"" for a microservice-platform, what existing framework would take me furthest?","The idea is that each team to create their own ""specification"" of:

* schema (something like an XML-schema, but don't tell them that, it would be uncool) which would allow (well, mandate) 
* operations and their inputs and what states these operations modify, and 
* a list of invariants, which must always hold true both in their system and in relation to such services, so something like ""if a client is disabled in the central system, we can't allow operations on them here either"" or ""grand total of client expenditure can't exceed their credit-limit""

so from those we could cook up some branching time-logic using some CTL implementation (I really want to avoid cooking our own).

I understand that we can't ""prove"" the internals of our microservices totally and we're not aiming to do so either. What we're trying to achieve here is a good way to do deterministic, exhaustive testing on a large, distributed project. We're not particularly fussed about the language, but would prefer Java (being the lingua franca) or at least JVM-based, but we can work with others if they mean less work.

  
What existing frameworks would you reach for and why?

8391,Google OAuth flow help!,"I am working on an android app using Godot 4.3 and I am having a hard time understanding how Google Oauth flow is supposed to work with the Godot engine. I have the following,

1. Google client ID set up.
2. A cloud server (resource API)
3. My Godot android app.

Currently, I have the flow structured following PKCE as follows,

1. Godot android app connects to cloud server via websocket and the cloud server starts a session providing the Godot android app with a session ID.
2. Godot android app generates varifier and challenge codes.
3. Godot android app sends starting auth request to Google with challenge code and the session ID.
4. Google redirects to my cloud server with token, and session ID.
5. Godot app sends the verifier code to the cloud server where the cloud server then gets the auth and refresh token and sets up the user on the DB.

I have a couple questions here,

1. Is this a secure flow (should I be sending the verifier token to the server)?
2. Should the server send the final auth and refresh tokens back to the Godot android app?
3. How would login persist on the app?

It seems like at some point, I need to provide the auth and refresh token back to the Godot android app so the app can cache this data. That way the user stays signed on.

Sorry for the long question. Still pretty new to this. Any input would be appreciated 🙂.",1727448471,407935,toughcookiemuncher,t2_vcsz1czl,02acd0952a03b2ffe7432e34275cbdaec668bdce9c28c8a5e328b2b2b7de28cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1fqphdw/google_oauth_flow_help/

I'd really appreciate it if someone could suggest a site or YouTube video that clearly explains all the variables with examples from code. Most of the resources online just assume everything is already understood.

Aside from that, let's say I have a recursive function that uses a helper method. I divide the problem by 2 each time, so in this case, I guess my a = b = 2. I read that f(n) is every other cost in the algorithm besides the recursive part. In my helper method, I have a for loop with T(n) = O(n). The rest of the code in the recursive function is O(1). So, is f(n) O(n) or O(1)? What if I had used a built-in function in the recursive function with a time complexity of n³? Would f(n) be O(n³)?

8407,Is this an easy problem to solve or is it not?,"I’ve read the sub rules and don’t think this violates them, but if it does please let me know.

Basically I just want to know if something is realistically doable, or is it an NP problem. 

So I play warhammer 40K, and for those unfamiliar you create an army roster based on choices of different units. Each one has assigned points values and in most cases a limit of 3 duplications. So naturally you can take lots of small units or a small amount of large or somewhere in between. The general standard size of game is 2000 points and points values range from roughly 60 up to 400 or so with a few outlier exceptions.

Anyhow, I’m a mathematician and curious to see if I could calculate how many different combinations can be made. Without the points values it would be an easy combinations problem, but they complicate things. Having asked around a few of my colleagues have suggested it’s more of a CS problem. 

I’m not a programmer and I’m not asking anyone to do it for me, as I say I’m just wondering academically would it be possible, is there an algorithm that can find how many different ways to make a set of values reach a certain sum?

To give an idea of scale, an example army has 47 data sheets, with two that can be duplicated for up to six entries, 9 unique entries and everything else being taken in 3’s as a max.

I was thinking about asking professors, but I just wanted some advice on whether or not I should ask my professors.

Every class I've been in has a large number of students. You don't really get a chance to interact with the professor too much. I have done well in some of those classes, and I have gone to office hours a lot, but the professor themselves wouldn't really know that.

I was just wondering how appropriate it would be to ask them to be my professional reference given they might not even know me personally, and the only thing they might know about me is that I have been in their class and gotten a decent grade.",1727549415,408144,redhairedpikachu,t2_epl1fczzk,917a7136fe7d880782e1932db680b954c9edb7faf9012c0ca917429db5b51fae,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1frl8tu/unsure_about_asking_professors_to_be_my/

8436,How much physical memory cells are there in a 64-bit memory?,"So recently I was learning about how the memory really works with it's memory addresses. I remembered that each bit is represented by a memory cell (transistor) right?
So if we assume that the length for each memory address is 32 bit or 64 bit. Does this means that the memory could theoretically have 2^32 and 2^64 of unique memory addresses (and memory) respectively?

Does this mean that if we want to calculate how much memory cells there are we should do: unique memory addresses * address length/size?
That means that we will get 2^32 * 32 memory cells for 32 bit memory and 2^64 * 64 memory cells for 64 bit memory? But this amount is enormous. This doesn't looks realistic right?

I don't want to think about how difficult it is cause that's a go-to problem for everyone. but I get out a coding session in class, present the thing and feel a sense of learning. like that amount of stress and pressure is one of the few things that helps me appreciate life? 
soon as I stop, there's less of something new to learn and I thought I was shit at math, but it's all that abstract concepts that has me in circles.

Does anyone know of any funded part time options? I need to keep an income but want to ideally have a course to run through with peers in an organised way. 

Some companies I've asked: QA, Northcoders, Le Wagon, Code institute and a few others. Springboard is paid for entirely (not funded) which had been suggested on here a few times from my research.

My alternative is to do a few self guided courses on freecodecamp or odin project.",1727723500,408509,empireofglass,t2_93ag5pf4,3444e06e5ea2799ad8bdc317d3b05a67bb018f835caaceeb1a8340faa2b42723,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/1ft3u7g/does_anyone_know_any_uk_gov_funded_bootcamps_that/
8474,Growing in this field ,"Need advice to grow in cse, particularly AI/ML field, to keep learning new technologies in new domains , keep discovering them , and keep being able to use them , and find ways to approach problems of various kinds of varying difficulty

Ye ofcourse i know the basics of ML, and neural networks etc , and a few technologies like yolo, bert, etc 

But how do I naturally know how to deal with several problems, discover the new, needed and suitable technologies for it, and quickly learn how to use it 

My friend in CS, he's been coding since 8th, and the way and confidence with which he can think of solutions for different problem statements (analyse it better), and always finds the right technologies to execute it 

So to summarise, i need to know 

1. How to break down problem statements, etc 
2. How to discover new technologies that can help solve the problem and also quickly learn to use them
